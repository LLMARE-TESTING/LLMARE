24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't ever write reviews but I felt this app needed one. I've used Pinterest for around 6 years and it was one of my favorite apps ever. However, slowly there have been ads taking over the app, and as of today it's impossible to actually scroll through and find something good. It is completely full of ads. You could scroll for 10 minutes and only see 10 posts related to your search, but 40 ads along the way. Love the app but I can't find anything anymore but ads.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and have used it for years, but I've noticed it's gotten more and more ads. It's not like they are unskippable which is good. It's just the app has felt more like ads with posts sprinkled in on the main page. Also after every time I download a picture, it pops up with contacts and friends on Pinterest to quickly send it to them but I don't want to do that üòÖ it's easy to skip but still does it have to pop up every single time? Can't I justtap send if I want to send it to someone",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely loved Pinterest! I have been using it from many years. Almost never had a issue. Recently I was looking out to customize my Android home screen. Found out about Pinterest widget. Everything's nice, but I have a suggestion. If you could add a feature that enables us to put a specific pin as widget it would be so much helpful. As some people (including me) love to do things colour coordinated. Hopefully you do something about it in near future. Overall love the app ! ! üíó",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! Great for finding photos and even better for sorting them. However, recently the 'more ideas' and 'organise' tabs have disappeared from the sections in my boards. This really limits my use of the app as I use sections in most of my boards and use these tabs to add to sort them very frequently. If this could be resolved, the app would be perfect.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this, but it's buggy & barely usable. You can no longer go to replies to your comments via push notifications, nor do replies show up in your activity feed in the app. Only a very small number of the push notifications from people interacting with your comments show up in your activity feed; a couple hours ago I woke up to 30 different push notifications, but only 2 of them showed up in the app. Ads are overwhelming; for every 10 pins, half or more are ads. It's been months of this.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I try searching for similar images it doesn't work and just shows a ""heads up"" message. That's extremely frustrating. Also every time you save something, the annoying message pops up, and there's a list of random people you ""might want to send"" the picture to, so I accidentally pressed it and send a message to a random person and couldn't even delete it",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look, I actually love this app. I used this one as a source of references for the art itself. But there's only one problem that this app actually missed something. A feature where you can delete some sent pins and messages from the inbox messages. Yeah, it was missing and I can't unsend or even delete some sent pins or even messages from other random strangers.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is really annoying with their video ads nowadays! thats all that loads up it takes FOREVER for photos to load, can't even view anything cool anymore because its all ads loading up. I dont want to see ads! Nobody does. This is ridiculous and ruining the whole experience. Its very disappointing. It was not like this just a few years ago. If this is how pinterest is going to be these days then i may aswell delete the app. Sad because this used to be my favorite app. SIGH..",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like using this app to collect my photos from my phone on private collections and save pins. I would give it a 5 star but it seems to be having a bug where the titles and descriptions are no longer showing on the mobile app when you create a new pin. It just shows your account profile. I rely pretty heavily on the titles and descriptions. It's still working for older pins, and I think it's just a bug with the new UI for making new pins. Hopefully it gets resolved soon.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pushing ads. I have used Pinterest for YEARS, and I am on the edge of deleting it. 8/10 times when I search for something, the app automatically switches to 'products'... NO!!!!! If I wanted to see a bunch of ads, I would choose too. I would never ever buy from Pinterest. STOP FORCING IT! I have to unclick the filter for every other search. It's not just me, but my friends who are bored of the same. Disgusting dystopian features killing your app trying to make money money money money money ‚ùåÔ∏è ü§¢",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. I consider it one of the best visual search engines ever. I recommend but the problems and issues are too much. I just updated it this afternoon, I have high internet connection speed, 4G LTE to be precise and I can't view the pictures. The pins come all right but I can't see them. Please fix this ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫, cuz I really love this app. All the pins inspire me and help me perform my favorite hobby. So pretty please fix this",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App had turned into a clunky POS. Ads take over most of my home feed. Seeing same pins over and over even after tuning home feed/selecting ""not interested."" Now long press to save isn't working anymore. It's to the point where if I'm not looking for something I've already pinned, I won't use the app, and will continue to do so until these issues are addressed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest removes or changes fundamental functional features consistently more than any other website I've ever encountered. Wish they would stop. Latest complaint can't organize pins or see ""more like"" in board sections, only main boards. 99% of my pins are in sections. App is fine, I enjoy the long-press to pin/edit functionality. Wish that the website as a whole would focus less on favoring branded content and shopping, search is essential no longer useful bc of this. But what can you do.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This has become nothing but ads. For every actual pin are 5 ads. & now I can't edit or reorganize my boards? There used to be a button to find more pins like the ones in your board's section but now that's gone along with the button to organize the pins you already had. I have no idea what they've been doing the past few years, but with every update, there are several new issues. Like with the number of ads, there are 5 new issues with every 1 fix they do.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. I would use it for inspiration for my artworks and just look for pretty pictures. Now I am disgusted by this app and am on the verge of deleting it. There are ads everywhere and it makes the whole experience so annoying. Everytime I go on my home feed, it's full of ads and there are very little relevant pictures to my interests. I am very disappointed and will probably stop using it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It seems like every link is an advertisement and when I click on what is supposed to be a recipe, I can't read it for the amount of pop up ads that cover the page. And I hate the fact that I can no longer she users who have saved my pins. You are ruining the things that made it great.. I use to love this app, but it is becoming so frustrating and hinders my enjoyment.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good platform for looking at pictures or looking for ideas/reference. I like it because I can find my comfort zone and I can use the pictures to edit something. But the only bad thing is SOMETIMES I CAN'T search what I'm looking for,I keep on clicking the search bar but it doesn't work.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great user interface! Pin recommendations are absolutely amazing and it's a fun app! However, one thing that needs fixing is the messaging feature....Im not able to reply to a particular message. There are only six emoticons for reacting to someone's message and Im not able to tell if the other person is online or not..All these make messaging quite inconvenient..... Overall it's a great app but needs fixing.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'll always love Pinterest. However, when attempting to pin to a board it's very slow to load, especially when selecting the section within a board, then again slow to load when pinning to the section. My internet is top of the range, so that's not the issue. I hardly use it anymore because of this frustration!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A few complaints I have about the app are as follows. When you are viewing someone's pot and want to like it, the app will move the like tab down to show suggestions-Highly annoying. Second thing is when you download a picture/post it takes forever for the notification that you lownloaded the pic/post to go away on its on. Third-when making a comment when in ones photos and back out it takes you to beginning of their photos. App has some annoyances!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The pins are super good and very useful and informative .. It is a cool source of multiple ideas and unique inspiration. Just one drawback is the chat interface .. it does not show whether the person whom you want to talk to is active or not, it does not allow you to delete your messages and does not support sending images. It would be good if you improve it ..",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My only issue with Pinterest preventing me from giving the app 5 stars is that comments with picture attachments are shrunk drastically. If it was left alone as it was years ago, then I would give this app 5 stars. Edit as of 6/22/23, not happy seeing a flood of AI art that I can't blacklist from my feeds and searches. I get that most is just for inspiration, but AI art is something I generally dislike. Edit as of 6/26/22, some videos play without audio. Recent updates bugged it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last two updates the app wouldn't refresh my feed at all. It's also become much more slow in my experience. The report system does not work best either in my opinion, I mean, I've seen so many inappropriate pins that I reported, and I got a notification that it was reviewed and everything's fine, while clearly not. Overall, the app worked fine before, but since the past few updates it has increasingly become more and more glitchy.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The android version of this app is horrendous. When pinning and item rarely does Pinterest pull up the correct board which means you have to scroll forever to locate the proper board. What's worse, the red validation error pops up on a regular basis. Clearing the cache and reinstalling does not help. The iOS version offeres so many more options. Shame on Pinterest for not giving Android users the same tools. Uninstalled.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has helped me organise my thoughts through my ups and downs, and inspired me to create more art. The overall layout/look of the app is honestly brilliant. I just had one suggestion, you should add the ability to tag a message/pin sent on the chat. Since me and my friends usually bombard each other with pins, that would definitely make it more convenient. You could also add the option to make groupchats without having to make a group board. Overall I completely recommend this app!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I liked this app, until I found out about the ""spam block"". It stopped me from saving a picture, it took me ten tries to actually get it saved. I don't know why you have such block, as it makes no sense whatsoever, especially since I was trying to save an image of a hairstyle/color to my hairstyles board! I think you should either tone down this block, or have it deleted all together, kinda interrupts my saving. Apart from this, the app is awesome, totally would recommend! Thanks for listening!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I still love Pinterest after 10+ years but there are issues: 1. Too many ads, and if you're battling with signal it becomes incredibly frustrating because the ads load before the content. 2. The page refreshing on its own drives me crazy. 3. The algorithms are too precise. It's either a case of you look at something ONCE, and that topic is in your feed for all eternity. Or great that the topics you are interested in are coming up but then that's all that's coming up. I really miss the variety.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent updates to the advertisement system have made the app almost unusable. I've seen the ads increasing over the years, but swallowed my frustration because I have used Pinterest for upwards of 12+ years. But I am just so frustrated with the noisy, interrupting ads placed almost every other pin. The new feature has a stall when swiping, so you have to swipe at least 5 or 6 times to move away from an ad (and sometimes that clicks on the ad site, which I do NOT want to do). I'm fed up!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love that I can keep recipes, patterns, plans and ideas all in one place and I don't need physical storage space for any of it! What I don't love are all the ads, pop-ups and other distractions while I'm trying to cook or follow my patterns, etc. I wish the ads and pop-ups only occurred during searching and not while using something I've already saved. I can't afford to pay for subscriptions to get rid of ads, or I would. That's why I give 3 stars instead of 5.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is awful, please fix the app, it's so buggy. If you hit the back button, the app refreshes. The app lags and does not move pins. I save images to my device and it will bring up a panel to send to contacts every time. This is a horrible design and it makes using the app quite frustrating to use. I'm at a loss for words how anyone would think that was a great idea. Also, why is it whenever moving pins to a section in a new board, puts it just in the board and not the section??",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Way too many ads, every third picture is an ad. So it makes it almost impossible to concentrate on what I'm looking for. Which is why I barely use it anymore. Also I can't get rid of the ""shopping"" board in my personal space. It gets made automatically if you save a product, I guess one of those tricky ads. And it ANNOYINGLY sits right at the top of my self made boards. I can't disable it or move it. So another ad on my own homepage.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was my favourite app until the last update. I used to love this app as it has variety of contents and easy to use. Now the app doesn't have the feature to scroll through the videos like used to be. Many of the videos doesn't support audios, showing ""Audio not available in your location"". I even used VPN, but it didn't worked. Please fix this issue.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the fact that the page keeps refreshing without no reason is absolutely annoying. other than that, when i tried to organize the images into another folder, the images kept moving, making it hard for me to choose the images. oftentimes, the images also appeared twice, even from the same creator. lastly, please, the images keep popping up on the page even though i already saved it. do something please.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A shadow of it's former self. Every other picture is a strange video ad that has nothing to do with the picture itself. There is also a CONSTANT message pop up ""Validation Error"" and when I say constant, I mean it, it pops up every 2 seconds no matter what I do. Also the page keeps refreshing itself - by itself all the time. I wish someone from Pinterest would pay attention to what their users have being saying for some time now and try to fix these issues. It's become non enjoyable.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app by a lot but I have a problem with the messaging notifications. I never get notified when my friends sends me a message. They have the same problem. We used to get notifications but now we don't and we have the notifications on for everything and I didn't get notified when my friends post a pin. So I hope this gets fixed edit: also I wish there was a feature where you can delete messages and hopefully add voice notes? that'd be great!üòä,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The density and constancy of large, unavoidable, and often moving ads makes using Pinterest a miserable experience. Its potential utility is ruined by the barrage of ads taking up between 1/3 and 1/2 of the display at all times. This is so obtrusive and annoying that I usually just close Pinterest when my entire screen becomes full of ugly, unrelated, and irritating ads.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So, Pinterest has improved since using it from last year. When I pin things, the app doesn't crash as much. One problem that keeps happening is the app will all of a sudden play audio from a video pin I haven't clicked on. Also when I look at boards with collaborators, I get a notification that states ""You cannot access this resource."" These thing freak me out, because I'm not sure why that happens. Pinterest works but it's very different.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every time I update a pin in my board the date when I last uploaded won't change. Like for example it says ""2 weeks ago"" then I upload a pin and the date won't change and the amount of pin stays the same. It also say ""User not found"" or ""Board not found"". It triggers me and makes my account flop. It's a big problem please fix it. I love this app but this is horrible.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"my absolute fav app but I've a few complaints; this has happened quite often, it suddenly crashes - nothing loads, everything is gone! I click on 'profile' and it shows 'User not Found'. it's so irritating sometimes. I've to re-install it when this happens and absolutely as what I've read, in a no. of videos it shows 'audio not available in your location'.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i can no longer swipe on a picture to save it to a board. edit: i can't save images to boards at all anymore! not by a regular swipe, not by clicking on, well, anything. which means i can't even really use the app, can i? i can't save images to boards. the VERY most basic function of the app been gone for me for MONTHS. i beg you to fix. uninstalling and installing again didn't do anything.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used pinterest for over 10 years and in the last six months alone i've had more problems with the app, the website, technical support than i've had over the entire time i've been using this application. Now my pinterest is all of a sudden showing me ""boards inspired by my boards"" and they are the same 4 boards every time and they are right in the middle of everything and dont go anywhere. What is wrong with these companies nowadays who clearly dont care about making things work properly.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Edit! I tried a trick because I'm old computer geek. I relabeled the self assigned unorganized fold as Pinerest stupid saves! That gave back the individual ability to resave pins or just delete them all. This odd folder since now a real folder can be deleted! Tested a save and my list comes up again...First post. After years all my saved pins are defaulting to an unorganized folder, at bottom of all boards. The unorganized folder has no folder features! Trying to resave pin have to make new file",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this is great for finding inspiration, and organizing your ideas. I especially love pinning websites I've found to my boards here. however, there are way too many ads; you can't scroll without their being at least one taking up space, which leaves you confused when you are searching something.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really wish they would fix the notification system. I try to click on the notifications they send me and instead of taking me to the comment I made, they don't make it appear at all. I also wish they would tell you EXACTLY which pin they removed from a board that you have and the way the board images are lined up doesn't make sense and is very frustrating.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has much to be desired. It is extremely buggy, some pins in feed or recommended glitch, their constant shift in space is terribly annoying. Constant errors from the app when you try to save pin. The feed page updates without the approval of user. The violations centre is not implemented in app and doesn't even show off when clicked. Extremely disappointing.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is fine, its pinterest ¬Ø\_(„É?_/¬Ø. I really hate how often they change pretty important UI elements, though. The fact that they took away long press to pin is so frustrating that i just don't use the app and won't until it updates and adds it again(edit 3: still not back!). Other than that, its fine, the algorithm can be a bit hyperspecific and the user culture of not credititing artists/photographers is genuinely concerning as a creative, but.

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is a visually captivating platform that serves as a digital bulletin board for users to discover and save ideas. With its intuitive interface and vast array of content, ranging from DIY projects to travel inspiration, Pinterest offers endless possibilities for exploration and creativity.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've loved Pinterest forever, but they have never had an easy way (in-app) to reach any support or give feedback when they have bugs (which is quite often). Right now most videos will not play with audio and I'll click on them several times before a small percentage of the audios will work. It's very frustrating and I'd rather just stick to TikTok for video content if they can't debug it. I just wish there were an easy way to report ui & ux issues. Huge oversight imo Yrs l8r: still BS",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My biggest issue with this app is that it re-sort the feed after I click on one pin to save it and the feed changes.. I may be interested in more than 1 pin, but when I come back, it's already changed itself. The pics are good, but there's some bug that prevents me from saving pics without opening the pic.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had this app for several years now with little issue. With the new guidelines, pins that I've had for years are being removed from my boards as inappropriate. Why are images in my health science board of charts showing normal blood pressure ranges and medication names considered inappropriate? The ads in this app have tripled since I first installed it too, I'll probably uninstall soon if there's no improvement.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pins saved before the latest version if updated is duplicated if you look at them in your profile. Not sure if you're still able to, but I wish they'd also make it possible to multi-select Pins, specifically the one(s) on your profile, that you saved before creating a board since it's exhausting having to manually add one at a time you want to a board because of it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is an okay app. I've gotten recipes, tips for art, and other stuff. My issue is that Pinterest keeps taking down pins that I saved saying it's ""adult content"", but all I save are recipes for cookies, other people's art, and photos from asia. It's so stupid. I sent an appeal and I bet they didn't even check it. Another issue is some of these things don't even relate to me. Yet, when I personalize my homepage, irrelevant stuff still shows up. Also, there's SO MANY ADS that it's ridiculous.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is unique and its structure of boards, sections and pins is the best. But it is a tremendous disappointment that it completely lacks a way to communicate with them. I have just lost years and years of Interior Design pins just because I tried to save a pin of personal style analysis called ""japanese skeleton analysis"" that compares 3 basic body types (similar to ecto- meso- endo- morph). The problem? My account have been deactivated with the accusation: ""adult content or pornography"".",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My favorite search engine for all things creative. I love being able to sort and store links how I want.

I used to use Pinterest all the time. Highly disappointed.",,,,,,

Where did the quick save feature go, where you could just press and hold a pic and a bunch of options would pop up, including save? Now you've got to actually go into the pin, scroll down, save, then BACKTRACK to get back to your feed, and half the time now your feed has refreshed and you lost some things that looked interesting. This is FAR more complicated and annoying now. And SAVING things is the entire POINT of Pinterest!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for over a decade now and it's a great app but there are too many ads. Also, the constant emails of ""adult content"" is vexing when it doesn't even tell me what pin it is so I can get an idea what is considered adult content vs ""art"" and the one time it gave me an option, it just sent me to the home page. As another user said, go after the pin or uploader, NOT ME. Not to mention the ads will sometimes have actual adult content. Do you guys even listen? FIX THIS",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The moment I changed my settings so that Pinterest doesn't gather any non-essential data about me, my dashboard was filled with entirely irrelevant content that I kept hiding as stuff that I didn't want to see, but I kept seeing it.

What I get is 9/10 times not at all relevant to what I have set and what I have been saving over the course of a few months at the very least. :/",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Lately, the messaging feature has been unbelievably irritating, making it so that I've accidentally sent pins to strangers and remote contacts. I hate it. There is no way to delete accidentally sent messages, there is no confirmation before sending them, and there is no way to completely turn off the messaging feature;there should be.I used to love this app, but it is increasingly making me annoyed, embarrassed, and angry, which makes me no longer want to use it.I sincerely hope it updates soon.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app would otherwise be the PERFECT APP if it weren't for the unjustifiable amount of ads. It's not just thr average amount of ads, it is genuinely impossible to use this app without there being at least 1 ad on screen at all times. 1 at a minimum, usually it's more. Some blend in alright due to preferences but most are huge, ugly, as that just show how money-hungry this app has become. Its not fun anymore. At all.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I miss the old Pinterest; before the algorithm change and ai running everything. There's less actual profiles and more junk.

There were actually 80% workout videos and 20% outfits in the results. I have marked workout videos as ""not relevant to me"" at least 50 times yet this is all Pinterest wants to show me. I'm done using this app.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This application although very useful but it was not good enough to save your data. I created a board and thete I saved some photos but they removed it. It was also locked by me. It means that board was not shown by anyone. After protection they remyit so there is no security factor you can lossed your data.,,,,,,

Every article there's pop ups, little boxes everywhere, and ads that pop up on the article and make themselves proudly known. Then when u click the ""X"" is takes you to the site of the ad or makes it bigger, thus throwing you off of your page. This app isn't even worth my tine and patience anymore.

I wish that we can clear up the home feed tuner and also wish that there is a clear search button so I don't have to manually press the cross button since it's a bit of a hassle for me.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Wow. I never knew the day would come, where I gave pinterest (my fav app) a 2-star review. The latest update needs to be eradicated. Firstly, why remove the convience of the long press button?? Even the save button has been removed under the three dots. I have to click the pin to full-size, then press save.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is no longer safe to use! So they finally got the undo button. I love that. But without warning pressing on some pictures takes you to websites with no warning. Several I'm pretty sure are ones you'd want to avoid for good reason. It's turned this app into a minefield. As far as I can tell there is no option to turn this off or even add a question option.

Add deletable messages and remove the feature where when you save a pin, a messaging tab pops up. I've sent so many accidental pins to people I don't even know and this is completely avoidable if you'd only add a delete message feature or just remove the automatic popup tab altogether.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads! Every scroll on mobile phone will have a video ad trying to grab your attention. It is incredibly distracting but intentional as you will definitely click on a video or static ad accidentally. Ads =revenue!

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's okay for gathering inspiration for art however it can be frustrating at the same time since lately I've gotten emails from Pinterest telling me a pin was taken down for violating their guidelines adding a link to see what pin and not add stuff like it but the link would never work so I never see the pin Pinterest was referring too. I will admit I have some pins that are a bit spicy but I'd like to see a setting for people 18+ to have reference like that cause no other app is as good for art,,,,,,

Though I'm having trouble moving pins I can only move pins up to 50 images max, would really appreciate it if I can move pins upto 500. Its time consuming because sometimes I dont notice that I've already clicked 500 pins and when I move it only 50 pins are moved. So I have to click those pins again. Really like it if I can move up to 500 pins <33",,,,,,

Also the ""updates and inbox"" needs to be worked on, both are very glitchy and need more features like deleting messags.",,,,,,

I'm so sick of it telling me I've hit a ""block to combat spam"" every time I try to pin more than a couple things.

I let it go four times just to see if it would keep it up. This is so obnoxious I have to close the app, and lose the boost or whatever the carrot was.

Already 2/3 of the quick save boards made useless, so now you have to hope that the last recommendation happens to get the board right (which I noticed isnt nearly as likely anymore).

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been using Pinterest since the beginning and it's had it's up and downs but it is currently unusable. Pins don't save even when I enter the link directly into the board. It definitely doesn't work when pinning from websites and when it did work it would post the same page repeatedly despite being different sources. It's a shame because I have a lot of saved content there and would like to keep everything together. I've already switched to Samsung Food for recipes.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the app with the exception of the ads that load before any posts on my feed. In fact I've noticed they interfere and affect the loading process when I open up the app or when it reaches a certain point (like one page down) and I have to reload again. I've also noticed that whenever I save a pin the app tends to double pin (or triple pin) a post to a folder. It happens a lot and I then have to manually delete one of error pins.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was fine, but it seems like they've decided to implement really heavy handed blocks on search terms, to the point of making the app useless to me. I can't even put together an outfit inspo board for Halloween because every time I search something I immediately get 0 results with suggestions like ""blonde ponytail looks"" ""fall pumpkin designs"" that have 0 relevance to the original search phrase. If that's all you're looking for, this is the app for you! Otherwise, don't waste your time.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be great, I would go on every day for years. Recently there was an update that caused thousands of accounts to be terminated unfairly, Pinterest citing ""explicit content"" that wasn't explicit at all, for example, a picture of a palm tree. And it is not just the creator of the pin that gets terminated, if penalized at all, it's everyone and anyone who pinned that pin. Many years and many hours spent carefully curating pins and boards, gone in an instant.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way they changed to make pins is horrible. At least from what I could see: can't delete the pin, can't replace the image, have to INSERT a image before you're able to type any words, the option to create a simple pin is at the bottom of the drop down instead of the usual top. Now, if all those options I listed that I'm not able to do, actually exist and you ARE able to do it, it definitely isn't found easily. The way it was before was BY FAR easier and the layout was far better.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The amount of ads is wild. There's no need. I like to listen to music whilst scrolling through the app but the unmutable adverts constantly pause my music. I don't want to be bombarded with info about something I dont care about. It's it incredibly annoying and has made me dislike the app. Another thing is the profile. I prefer when all saved pins where saved to one board to show what was saved. Now it takes up so much space in the area your created pins are saved. Very unappealing,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has pretty much become a part of my life now, it's literally the place I go first when I need quick inspiration for things, but these updates are making the app more worse than better as they state it. Whenever I save a picture it's that ""Share"" popup. What if I want to download multiple images but now have to take an extra 10min just to download 5 or something.

Like, the slides, when you click on the slide instead of showing up the next slide, it used to pause which i don't like. I genuinely request to bring back the old version of this. Thank you!!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I always love Pinterest for years. However, the ""Back to Feed"" button on the top of menu that suddenly popped up is really annoying! I often mistouch it and I've lost many great pins that I want to save on my board. Please, remove it! We don't need that because there is home button already! I can go back with ""Back"" button instead using ""Back to Feed"". Keep up your good work!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is probably my favorite app and has been for awhile. However heads up on the location of the refine button. I'm constantly hitting it when I swipe and then I end up deleting one of the posts to where it says 'sorry won't show you this anymore' or whatever it says and I can't get it back. Also miss the old explore button. Old layouts were better.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like it on my tablet, but when I tried to uninstall it off my phone it won't go away. It says it's a system app, but I don't think so. I have tried to uninstall different ways, even on the app store. Very annoying and suspect. Finally managed to uninstall it, but it took several attempts. It is definitely not a systems app. Great on my Chrome book though.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy using the app! It's very good for searching references, getting inspiration and ideas. I am a Pinterest user for many years now, it almost never disappoints me, However- I switched for a new phone not so long ago and for some reason it won't open here. It's just endlessly loading the start menu. It still works on my other devices but won't work here. I tried everything I know.. uninstalling, resetting.. Edit: updating that after a software update i was fixed!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It would be nice if navigation is easier. As you click on pins and wish to go back to a previous pin, it's not so easy to navigate and find that previous pin after a series of clicks. Furthermore, it would be nice if we can edit images on pinterest: highlight, encircle, & makes notes on the image then pin it on a board. Pinterest is a really great way to visualize ideas so this last bit would be helpful in personalising how these ideas will fit a person's specific needs",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest, but it could use 2 quality of life updates: 1. Update the reorder function. When using a separate layout for reordering, its almost impossible to tell how the final layout will look. This is incredibly frustrating when trying to get pins to be in a specific order. 2. More of a request, but it would be really cool if you had the ability to create sections within sections.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the update, it's being really buggy. When I open the app, it freezes and then I have to close it out (which sucks whenever I see a pin thats interesting/funny on my feed and then I have to close the app bc it froze). Also, pinning things have started saying ""We cannot complete your request"" or something. Its happens multiple times. Hope this gets fixed! :)",,,,,,

Otherwise it's a great platform!!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app for most things,like inspiration boards or just using it to pass time, but lately I've had this really annoying problem where whenever I scroll through the videos suddenly I can't hear any of the audio. I tried fixing it by maybe using headphones but the only solution is closing and re-opening the app,and if it wasn't happening all the time I wouldn't comment on it. But it's once every 8-ish videos or so. This also started happening now,so I doubt it's my phone.",,,,,,

Attempts to get help are answered with unrelated boilerplate. I hate that I open the app and see a pin I want to explore, but it's gone before I can click on it. Let ME decide when to refresh the page, please. Also hate that you took away the ability to add a caption when adding a pin, so that I have to go find it and edit to add a caption. That being said, I use the app constantly.",,,,,,

I usually don't mind the updates, but this newest one I don't like. My eyes strain while looking at the screen, as it seems the pins are a bit smaller than previously. I can't use the app for long before getting a headache. The previous layout was more useful, as well.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is good, but used to be great. My biggest complant is how it thinks I am only interested in thats that I recently pinned or searched. Sometimes a search isnt for me, but to help a friend next me with ideas, so when I open the app later, I dont care to see those results purple and yellow bridesmaid dress again. Ever. Also, bring back the category tiles. I like to browse whole topics for ideas I never thought of, let alone thought of to type in the search bar!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! I use it every day! Only issue is that occasionally the four icons on the bottom of the page (home, search, notifications and my profile) don't show up so there's no way to search for things or go to my pinned images. The icons never used to be like that in an older version and I never had the issue then. I also liked it more when it was a white background. Apart from that, it's awesome, so it still deserves 5 stars.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very addictive app and literally has anything you can possibly think of. Crafts, quotes, memes, party games, cute cat videos e.t.c anything you want, just type it in the search bar and you will get hundreds of results. The deducted star is because it uses data super quickly making it the type of app to use mostly on wi-fi or if u have unlimited data. But other then that, its a good time waster and perfect for inspo.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app... however, the more I use it, the more I realize it's pretty much all the same link with different pictures. Very misleading! I wish there was some sort of way you could make it were it can't do that. I click on one thing look at the link then go to another one and it's the same dang website just a different picture and description. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏?and now it's just 90% tiktok videos, but you can't search those. You find a recipe that was from tiktok; good luck finding it again.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest, it's one of the easiest places for me to sort through and be introduced to ideas, as well as being incredible for references! It is easily my favorite layout of an image heavy site. The problem arises, however, in the lag that has started plaguing this app about 2 months ago. Pinterest has often become unusable since this has started, as it will refuse to load any content at all. I have redownloaded the app and verified my phone is working properly since then to no avail :(",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think that Pinterest is the most amazing app EVER!!! It takes me to awe-inspiring places and shows me incredible things that I never knew existed! In addition, I can research and save things like recipes, building plans, sewing and art techniques and much, much more!!!! It is also, in these scary, turbulent and unpredictable days, a comforting & illuminating way to stay connected to all of the beautiful things that are still out there in our world.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It seems that after every update it gets worse. I know everyone says that. I liked the app when you could explore without targeted suggestions because that's how you find new things. The explore feature is gone gone and now everything it based on history and its stuff I only need to look at once. Lately what has been happening is I'll be browsing and a dumb commercial starts singing and I'm not on an ad and can't find it to mute. It's commercialised and loses quality with every upate.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just wish that the search results were a bit more accurate. Sometimes I feel like it just shows results from each search word. For example if I look up ""Black woman autumn outfits"" it will show me results of white women wearing black autumn outfits, not what I asked, and I know there are some on the app. Other than that, it's great for finding recipes and lots of home ideas. It has its perks for sure",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it, but I think it could still use some work. I hate how when you're scrolling through your feed if you click on an image to look at it, and then go back, it automatically resets the feed, makes wanting to check out multiple things a watse cause now it's gone forever. Plus the recommendation algorithm could definitely use some work. It's like if you pin an image of a woman with clothes, the next thousand or so pins will be women's fashion.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for years, and with each update it gets better and better. I have so many boards saved and I'm able to organize them as I so please. There is one minor thing I would like changed, like when I watch a series of reels on one of my boards, the reels after the first will be randomized and I have to go back and fourth. It's not all bad though, as sometimes it's handy, but I think we could benefit from some sort of button to use. Other than that, this app is just about perfect.",,,,,,

I'm an artist so I have multiple boards for inspiration for poses, fashion, etc. And I've missed out on saving so many inspiring pins because the save button completely disappeared on me. I've restarted my phone, logged out and back in, and nothing changed, it's quite frustrating.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this app but since February it's just sucked! They took away messages, which I used often to send and receive pins, I can't find any of my friends at all and if I do it says their account is private, which they aren't, and there's an ad every other pin! Not to mention how annoying it is to click on a pin in your home page, save it, and have the whole page refresh. Pinterest went way down hill in a short amount of time and it's really frustrating! Fix the problems you've created!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use. Great to see thread options based my most used sections. However there are several downsides. The sort function can be a pain to resort pinned images. The constant ads, especially the video ads are annoying. I have to repeatedly turn the sound off manual for each one. They are also repeatative even if I chose to hide the pins. Overall a decent app for mood/image boards but could be done better.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What I don't like about Pinterest anymore is that the algorithm just gives me more and more of the same thing. I used to like it for showing different crafts and ideas that I had never heard of. Now it's just feeding me more examples of what I have specifically looked for. I can always do a search for more ideas on one subject, but I wish the home feed was much more generalized üôÇ",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You are not able to contact them concerning the app. The main website contact page doesn't have any options to make suggestions or express greivences over app related features. I tried the email here, but it is not working anymore. Looks like they don't care about what the people that use the app want. I liked the app fine, but it got worse only because the visual search button covers the bottom of the images. I don't always want to click on the image to go to the page, because the image could be buried in the page and I don't feel like hunting. But now I can't see part of the image. It was a little better before with the thing that was there(can't remember for the life of me, but it was also in the way, just smaller.) Please don't cover the image.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why why why did they get rid of the explore function? It was all I used to do on pinterest! The home page doesn't at all show me content I am interested in and trying to modify it by x-ing out posts that I don't like seems to just make it worse, there's so much clickbait on there now it's unbearable. Also the explore function helped me to find things I am interested in in categories I haven't known about before. Basically after they removed that function pinterest now became useless to me. I sincerely hope they will bring it back or at least make their algorithm for the home page better. I used to love pinterest but now it has become just so lame.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just an idea but it would be great if it had a night view. Also, the one thing I have disliked the most is when there are videos approaching as I am watching some pins in my homepage my music automatically closes even when I am still missing like 5 more pins to get to the pin that has a video. And honestly it wouldn't bother me so much if after that the music played once again but that's not the case. It literally closes the music, I must go back to the music app to turn it on once again.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The interface is fairly easy to use, and I like the long hold options in the app. Lately it has been crashing without warning though. Also, the algorithm keeps suggesting things that are not in line with what in looking for. I keep saying ""less like these"" but it keeps coming back. Oh and an option to say ""I found what I needed for X search"" would be very helpful.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, used it for years. Desktop verion is a disaster, app is great. However, the recent update puts all your saves by default under ""profile"", so you have to make extra clicks quick enough on the opposite end of the screen to change to put this back in the right board. This is an annoyance that honestly makes me irritated and reluctant to use the app since it really breaks the user friendliness and streamline feel. If this is changed back i rate 5 stars. :)",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a pretty good app. I really want to rate it better, but there's this really annoying flaw where it just randomly lowers the volume of any music you happen to be listening to. This might not seem like a big deal but when you're just browsing images and listening to music and the music just suddenly gets super quiet it's really annoying. And then if you raise the volume to counteract it then as soon as you close the app the volume jumps back up.",,,,,,

I am really sad that this explore feature is gone and I dont know if I will continue to use the app because it doesnt provide the same search ability as it used to. Hoping the explore feature comes back.",,,,,,

Maybe I am just afraid of change, but I feel some of the changes that have been made were unnecessary. I think my home page has become to targetted, focusing more on my last search than general interests. I am not super crazy about so many ads or the shopping and comment feature. I still love this app and can still get stuck down the Pinterest rabbit hole.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like Pinterest, its simple. However, there seems to be more and more issues as I keep using it, very simple issues that I've seen many people complain about but are never fixed. For example, when on the mobile app, you can swipe through a couple pins on your board before it stops you from swiping. You then have to exit out of the picture, pick a new one, start swiping through again, before the same thing inevitably happens. On desktop versions, this feature is entirely nonexistent.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good, high-quality app (one of the better-known ones) It's great for inspiration but a problem that I found a lot of people have is working the boards and groups/subgroups. I don't find it a problem, other than being time consuming. But be warned, they send TONS of notifications, even when I block it they still find a way to overflow my email. I think notifications should stay on the app and not be sent by text/email. Other than that the app is great and useful!",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A really good app for if you do you're own art. My only problem is there's no good way to share pins across boards besides saving them. Though when you save them, it recreates the pin. So you would have to individually save the pin to every board and recreate it every time. Making the pins tab messy. I just make a separate board to post all my art and use that to save to different boards to keep it clean. But you can just add sections in the art if you want but I like the seperate boards.",,,,,,

Now, the fact that the newsfeed is completely randomized and auto refreshes is messy and annoying, and makes it impossible to know what you've missed from boards you like.

In my mind the concept sounded great, no more searching for an item you saw on pintrest. This app is awful, does not seem to be well thought out at all, nor professionally done. Reroutes to things not pertaining to what you want to search. Not fun anymore. Miss old app.",,,,,,

Also, clicking for options from the home feed does not provide the option to save a pin anymore, I have to actually open the pin to be able to save it to one of my own boards, then go back to the home feed to keep browsing.

And in your messages, it deletes pins/messages you send that are more than a week old....this newest update is very annoying and not good at all.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Pinterest. Then they bombarded it with SO MANY ads. I don't mind an ad every 30 pins or so, but having one every second or third pin is ridiculous. Also, without the explore tab, I don't see the point of Pinterest anymore. I don't want to only see what the Pinterest algorithm suggests for me. I want to see new things I wouldn't have known about without Pinterest. Just because I liked one recipe for a cake one time DOES NOT mean that I want my home feed inundated with different variations of that recipe. So please...

The fact that the algorithm is very insensitive to social/ gender issues, i.e. try to look up information on one issue and it shows the exact opposite of what you are looking for, and trying to avoid. I know it's a computer, but the programmers should think about that for future renditions.",,,,,,

Sometimes I actually saved the same URL without realising and there was no alert on the app prior to it being saved. Another annoying problem is that we can't search for Pins within a shared Board that were pinned by others. Only my own Pins come up in the search",,,,,,

That stinks and until this issue is resolved, I refuse to use this app anymore!",,,,,,

I used to be able to just swipe through the pictures at ""more like this"" under a picture. But now that feature is either removed, or it's a problem. That's also in sections with the boards. I'd like to swipe through everything again, instead of constantly tapping something and going back to go to the next one!",,,,,,

Also it the boards don't look good now that there is one big picture and two smaller ones. The bigger picture is really blurry.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have had pintrest for over 5 years and I think that it is a good app the description and pictures pretty much show you what you would expect it easy to use and you can find pretty much anything your looking for sometimes if you press too many things at one time it might glitch. I don't like that when you have a pin saved and it's gets taken down it doesn't show you what the pin was and that when you already have a pin saved in a board and try to save it again that annoying notification pops u.,,,,,,

BUT there has been such an annoying glitch for the last few weeks that now I dont even like getting on it. any time I try to pin something, the audio from different videos- ads or pins starts playing in the background and even when I exit the app, it still plays. I have to completely close it (like swipe it off the page entirely) and reopen it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app had always been great, recently though, through the new updates it has gone down. Theres lots of ads sometimes, the video adds become very annoying.

Otherwise it's a great app, there's always plenty of what your looking for, great for planning things out and finding ideas. Also great for mood boards and such",,,,,,

Started using it again recently to plan our next renovation, & while I still find it a useful tool, I don't like a lot of the changes they've come up w/ since then. I don't like that it always opens to a suggestion feed, & that I have to click through 2 more screens to get to my saved boards. I also don't like that some ""pins"" turn out to be ads that take me straight to their site when I try to pin them!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's my go to app for all DIY references. My searches usually return a multitude of options. The only thing I could think of that might be negative or a little annoying is that some search results come back with my default language in their titles, but when opened, the text will be in some different language. Some results lead to dead links that only relay something to the effect of ""web page not found"". But, to be fair, these issues can be found in any and all search engines. Thanks!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good ap but it can be hard to navigate in reverse e.g. if you click on one photo and then want to go hack a couple screens to find another photo you liked. It's also difficult to get to the original webpage where a photo comes from ( the ap kind of traps you) if, for example, you're trying to work out where a photo's from or the story or history behind it. But I still like the ap. It's a fun way to surf by image and organise images by category. I just wish they'd make a few tweeks.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love using this app to find and store recipes. It has 2 big drawbacks. 1: the search engine. Too many items are listed that are irrelevant to your search. 2: adware/advertisements. It's beyond annoying that ads pop up over the top of the recipe you're trying to read, or take up half of the screen space. Also, when searching for a recipe, too many of the results aren't recipes, but sales ads for that dish from retailers.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience on Pinterest has been very positive overall, although there are some areas that could be improved. First of all, I've had numerous situations wherein I would not be able to save a pin because the display of pins had been automatically shuffled. I believe that the automatic shuffling should either be made into a manual shuffling (activated by pressing a ""Shuffle"" button) and it should be made optional in the settings. As I said, my experience has been very positive overall.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has a lot of really annoying bugs: when I wanted to save a pin, the notification's saying it's saved, but it isn't, or sometimes when I'm watching a video random music starts playing, or while creating a pin instead of my photo Pinterest puts there a photo of a woman! There's also a bug with in-build browser: when one's redirected to a site, pinterest forbids you from scrolling up or down. I suppose the app just thinks you're still browsing pint., preventing you totally from scrolling",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! Favorite app, only glitch is when you select a pin from the main feed to scroll though more ideas like it below, and click one of those suggested pins to save it and return to the previous suggestions, it starts you back at the top of the list every time instead of putting you back where you left off- so annoying to scroll forever past everything you've seen just to find your place/keep looking at suggestions. When you see many good pins, it makes you not want to pin them- antithetical!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use pinterest for memes, which isn't ideal because the UI is terrible. They've added this horrible black bar at the top of pins so you can't read anything at the top of the image. There's also a ""search in image"" feature that takes the form of a box in the lower right image corner that you cannot hide! It makes reading stuff and looking at fanart a pain. If I didn't have literally thousands of pins saved I'd have left ages ago.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every update makes this website more and more inconvenient. If I wanted to watch nothing but videos, I'd use youtube or tiktok. If I only wanted buyable products, I'd search an online store. The algorithm works to mostly show you videos and advertisements. I could deal with these features until they removed the ability to filter your search by a specific board. If I want to focus on content for one board, I no longer can. Why would they ever remove that feature?? It was unbelievably useful.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This use to be such a great user experience but in your quest to monetize, I feel like I am drowning through one long pop up ad- irrelevant pins, limited search by image feature and only images available are ones that I can buy. This was better when you let me search for an image that I wanted and then recommended something similar. Instead you're only showing things that I can purchase, whether the ""fit"" is right or not. I also liked the ability to explore random things.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for years, and it is a great program. However, the ads on the app are excessive at this point, and the video features that interrupt things happening in other tabs (Spotify, for example) is also too frequent for me to keep using the app. If there were an option to disable the videos, I would continue using and restore the full five stars left in the past.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One of the best apps I've ever used, I always find inspiration, regardless of the domain. The app loads very fast, no bugs or errors so far, and I've been using it for five years now. Edit: I may understand the introduction of the Profile option for saving pins, but sometimes it becomes inconvenient when it automatically saves there, though I want to save it on a specific panel. Moreover, if I want to edit a pin, the entire UI for the Edit Pin section crashes, it becomes compressed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When we block somebody, I'd like it if they'd stay blocked. I shouldn't have to see them (vise versa) in my feed still.

For some reason, that feature always comes and goes.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app, so so much. Although, there are some minor things that I believe can be fixed. Those issues would include - the ""explore"" tab disappearing, occasionally. I can still look things up, but I don't see very many recommendations since I can't see the recommended things based on my profile and trending content. Another thing, would be swiping. I've noticed that I can only swipe in certain situations. Again, I adore this app, its HIGHLY RESOURCEFUL, but some improvements can be made.",,,,,,

Come on! In addition to everything all of the other reviewers have had to say: the ability to fast scroll or even search our own boards to pin things to would be phenomenal, and I miss the ""random"" pins that used to appear on my home screen (now it's all ads tailored to whatever algorithm it thinks I want to see). Disappointing.",,,,,,

Its harder to find new ideas and interesting people. Everything and everyone (THAT YOU SEE) is exactly the same.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have always liked pinterest but the past months it has gotten rather annoying. It started off with a lot of click baits, now I still have a few but it has improved. Instead I now get beautiful pictures and when i try to use the link, it doesn't show an article, just a webpage loaded with ads. And worst is the integrated new ads. They look like normal posts and appear way too often. I don't want to see this! I used pinterest because it didn't have any..",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love pinterest but little annoyances are building up. There's literally an ad every 4 pictures now. Also, they took away the ""press and hold"" option while scrolling that would give you the save button. To save anything I now have to click on the image and then go to the save button. This is adding minutes to my experience with all these clicks! I genuinely hate it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Bad algorithm. Even if you click at tens of pics of one type, the app still won't include them to your feed. What bugs me most, is that when you don't use the app for a (long) while, the algorithm will show some really weird clickbait pictures and not what usually catches your interest. I'd like to see a list of users who likely have boards I'm interested in. As of now they are a bit hard to find. I'd like to explore more topics but it's not suggested. I have to look for things manually",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'll be honest. The app is quite glitchy ‚Ä?for example, I just did the survey in it and then was stuck on the last page, nothing happenned. And my feed is just chok full of content I did not subscribe for and do not care about. I really, really wish there was a way to deactivate recommended pins or at least make it so that they do not make up the biggest part of my feed. Not to mention that many of them still do not cater to my interests. The search algorhithm is good though",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app; the user experience was smooth & seamless scrolling. The new updates make it so difficult & frustrating. The long-press action to save a pin was perfect. Now you can't even save an image directly from the home feed, which seems incredibly counterintuitive. When saving a pin, it autosaves to I guess whatever board the app thinks you wanted it on? So that's yet another step to go in and save it to the correct board. It makes me less and less interested in using Pinterest.",,,,,,

I mean, I used this app back in 2013, it was one of the first apps I ever used on social media, so maybe I'm biased. It's just I don't see how getting rid of cool filter features, easy to manage boards, etc, makes it better. Apps shouldn't update regularly except to fix bugs or add more useful features. They overdo it and take the magic out of the app we first fell in love with.",,,,,,

It has endless ideas, tutorials, trends, instructables, teaching aids, information on tons of different things, you name it. I promise there is something for everyone on Pinterest!

Often, when reading through the pic, that button in every bottom right corner always blocked that specific view and the only thing to do was to press it, swipe down, and zoom in just to finish a sentence. It ain't a bug, but it was certainly annoying to say the least. ‚Ä? So, please. Consider to re-design or re-place the Magnify Button somewhere else that won't block the whole picture.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An absolutely amazing app. Not only does it provide you with tons of pics that are easy to download and save on boards, and that you can follow others, but the team behind Pinterest makes sure that it's a great environment. There are certain things that can't be searched for, and if you do, they provide a link to get help. There are pics of certain things, like places on Earth that are being used in the ""wrong"", that are being removed and unavailable. Unlike other apps, Pinterest cares. Thanks.",,,,,,

I can access it from my desktop for when I need to print things like forms, patterns, schedules, and even blank coloring pages. It even suggests things based on my wanderings and while some of it is off the mark. Even more is a homerun. Also the app works great as long as its updated.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The pinterest itself is wonderful. But the app seems to be a knife to cut a tree. The main purpose of the app is to view images. But you cannot zoom enough to read the contents of the images. Also the full screen mode is not very straightforward which it should have been. When you are in full screen mode, most of the screen is occupied the visual search option and there is no way getting rid of it. In a single word you just cannot view the images properly with this app. I think for this reason it would be fair enough to say this app has failed to pursue it's primary goal.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While I truly love this app, the developers need to get with times in terms of basic features! Sometimes it's difficult to do very basic stuff like clear your search history; you have to delete each item individually! If you block someone due to their content, etc., they don‚Äôt actually get blocked in the normal way; both parties can still see each other's feed; like wth?!

I have to exit & keep trying to come back to the app. The second is the random music or ads that play loudly when I click on a pin, that seems to be coming from no where. Please fix these issues.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Is pretty good overall. Needs improvement in the areas: It would be nice if we could save a photo & go right back to where we left off instead of having to scroll quite a ways to get back to where the original photo was saved. I am not able to organize my boards within the app. I cannot alphabetize the sections that are within the main board.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent layout, but there video ads are the worst. There's no option to turn off the sound, so either you get jumpscared by a pancake tutorial at 3am or just perpetually leave your phone on silent. Additionally, if you're listening to music while scrolling through each pin, it will dampen the sound of your music one screen before the video. Your music, even if you exit the screen, will remain quieter until you shut down the app entirely. Not to mention the fact that the videos autoplay regardless if you're using data, and will essentially use up ALL of your data. On advertisements. That you don't even bother looking at. It's pretty evil.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the pinterest website, love the app, my only complaint is that a number of buttons are on a bar that disappears when you scroll down. Sometimes it doesn't come back unless I close the app and reopen it, so I can't go to my own boards, or enter search terms. Edit: this has become a less common issue, but now if I'm trying to save something to a board with sections it refuses to show the last section or two if I have more than 4 sections.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app in particular for gathering ideas as well as browsing for free patterns on crafting. It's easy to navigate and cultivate your own feed quickly, but the downsides are certain ads and that not all pins link to where you would assume they go. Ads are a must naturally, but some pictures I'd like to take a closer look at rather than be immediately sent to the link on buying parts for the project. As far as pins are concerned, some patterns can be advertised as free but lead to a website that asks for purchase. Naturally the app is working to improve this, but it is a concern none the less.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, I enjoy the app and use it a great deal. However, minus 2 stars for these two things: no real follow through with help tickets, if they require more than one email exchange; the weekly updates can mean...and have meant...that sometimes features you use can be dicontinued on a whim, or new bugs can crop up that make navigation tricky (a previous update had the home screen refreshing pause my Spotify stream every time).",,,,,,

Another thing is when my data speed is at least 2 mbps the video do not start quickly. About UI the straight layout feels very monotonous. To display some images which needs whole screen there should be one single block. Increase more option in relevance of pins that's show more or less like this. That's feedback but yes its a really great app. Unique in its own ways.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well, it's really great but I'm afraid the image search option on a pin causes you to have to dodge around it because it covers a lot of writing. You can't just look at it and go. You have to look, move around, or try to read the small text without clicking/tapping on the pin.

Some issues canbe fixed but the app as a whole is one of my favourites and fun to use.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest. Use it all the time. Its one of my favorite forms of stress relief. But I'm really sad with how the app has been set up. Up near the top of the screen there was a watch tab. I could just swipe over and there was a bunch of tiktok style videos I could watch and enjoy. I open it this evening and its gone. Between that and how they took away the feature that lets you hold pins to save them, block them, or send them to others, the app version of pinterest has gone downhill.",,,,,,

Go to another's board and try clicking on an article, you may wind up in no-man's land. That's where you lose me. Not even clear what the apps for. Bad 4 recipes & that' why I downloaded it to begin with. Don't even really know even how to a set up a profile. Yes, I'm old, but I'm not THAT old.

When these little issues aren't popping up it's usually my one-stop place for searching references for all sorts.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've loved Pinterest for such a long time, thank you all for the work you do. I'd also like to voice some annoyances: 1) The story feature and multiple ""slide"" feature on the pins seem not to work for me. When I tap on a pin with multiple slides, I'm only able to see the last slide with the creator's information. If I try to tap back to see the entire pin it ""flashes"" and stays on the same screen/slide. 2) I'd also love to see further improvements on the skin tone/ethnicity query filters.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Please add a new feature for board searching while saving a pin. The app is great, the content, the algorithm, but a lot of time is spent while searching for the actual board I want to save a pin to when using the app. Not all recommended boards are the one I want to save my pin to, and if I would be able to search for it instead of scrolli all the way down, it would make the UX and the underflow a lot more enjoyable and smooth. Please consider adding such a feature in the near future.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"5 stars because it really is one of my favourite apps, but I only have one complaint (and it's not really a complaint, more of a suggestion): when adding new pins or when moving pins from one board to another, if on the app, I have to scroll down through all my boards until finding the one I want, and that can be inconvenient. I wish we had the same feature as the desktop site does of having a search bar, so it can be easier to locate the board you want.",,,,,,

All the thing I love in one place, and I get to save everything in organized boards. It was easy, very few distracting ads. Now it is almost unbearable to use. Ads, pop-ups, every time you try to look at an page, it's utter chaos. Its a lot easier to avoid the chaos when using a PC, but forget the mobile app.",,,,,,

I find myself looking up directions how to do stuff on Pinterest, more than I get to enjoy it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new update removed the ability to easily pin pictures into desired boards, instead lumping all pictures into one folder instantly (which does not have the option to be made private).

It's really frustrating because I then can't use the app for a while. Sometimes it works and other times it just does this. Any advice on how to fix this?",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use Pinterest a lot but the recent update seems to had a detrimental effect on the usability of the app. I can no longer click on a thumb image and have it open up properly. It zooms in to one section of the image leaving the rest off screen. If you try to zoom out if just runs a visual search on the item in the photo. I hope this gets sorted in the next update.,,,,,,

My main problem is, is that i have made a board with almost 200 pins, and would like to download them all at omce, and not individually. It takes too long. An idea for future updates would be too add that feature, as I feel it would make the app much better for those trying to downloading a large board.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've really enjoyed pinterest over the last few years. But these most recent updates have been kinda terrible. The app fails to load sometimes, which it never did before, and it's starting to look more like another ""blog/social media"" site like Instagram. The fact that there's no option to turn off a lot of these new functions is pretty frustrating. There's also a lot more ads than before, and the home page displays things I just looked at instead of new things now. I hope it gets fixed...",,,,,,

This would save so much time from looking through everything!!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Stupendous for references and recipes. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because when scrolling through my boards it sometimes glitches and stops scrolling.

Besides that it's honestly a good app to use when you're bored or just want something to do :))!

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Even though the idea of Pinterest and taking things as photos and articles and memories of locations that you've been on websites it's a novel idea. It requires a certain amount of finite refinement which will take years to accomplish.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has a special place in my heart for being a safer space in comparison to other social media's. There's not a lot of toxicity and focuses less on the interaction, but more on pretty pictures. On the down side though, I don't like that the try feature was removed. Wasn't trying out ideas and sharing that experience the whole point of pinterest? Also, the messaging feature can use some work, like the ability to react or reply to single messages, or unsend messages.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every week they say they ""polish the app"". I think they polished it so much they wiped all the good stuff off. There are lots of little changes that are irritating me, but the main one is when I get a notification that someone saved my pin, I can't find it on the app. It's either not there or it says ""this notification no longer available"". It didn't used to be like that. I could go in, click on the notification, and I see the saver's boards and could see what they're into. Just ads there now.",,,,,,

The ads are often relevant to my search but then I can't do anything besides click on them and be taken away from Pinterest. You can't save the ad ideas, so they are functionally useless for the app. It's unusable now since 3/4 of what shows up are ads you can't save. Its user interface is needlessly complicated. This concept went from genius to trash.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Really disappointed with the direction Pinterest is going. The days of endless effortless scrolling are over. I've found every time I pin something to a board of mine the app crashes. There is music that starts playing out of nowhere if I click a pin that is only a picture. It was a lot of changes that happened fast and I don't think they tried to work any of the bugs out. Really hoping they revert back to what it was because this new format sucks.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a super cool app and it's really great for when you're bored. But there is some issues with the audio. It always shows that the audio is not available in your location. Most of my favorite videos doesn't have sound. And it would be great if Pinterest has video downloading feature. There are a lot of beautiful videos and if there is a downloading feature it would be soo great. I hope Pinterest will fix it,,,,,,

Getting rid of the board search when pinning and the pop-up elipses icon to download an image makes everything much more inconvenient.

Recently though, I've run into the issue when using the app of not being shown what I search for. I'll search, for example, ""smoke aesthetic"" and it will show me one or two images actually related to my search (mostly products) and then the rest of the images will be unrelated. Eventually, when scrolling that search, it just stops showing results. If this could be fixed it would make the app much more convenient to use.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Perhaps we could STOP trying to ""fix"" things that are perfectly fine (like the app's layout and search options) and START fixing things that actually need to be changed like the app constantly freezing, closing on its own, and peoples' boards getting messed up.

But since about 2 months ago, the app, at least on Android, has become completely unusable. On my home page, I get far more ads with the little price tag thing than actual pins. The usual ratio is somewhere around 11:1 at this point. On top of that, whenever you click on a pin and then go back, it scrolls you a random amount back up the page.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The changes to make it better aren't always for the best. It's still a good platform but the paper airplane icon was more fun for sending pins, the spinning pin was fun when boards or pins loaded, sending from a desktop was easier because it didn't look like you were uploading where is now it does look like you're uploading. Baby search more box that nests in the bottom right corner is really annoying because it often covers words or you accidentally touch it when you're trying to zoom in.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've loved this app for years. I like how the developers introduce new features and remove them if the users don't find it useful. But I quite liked the double tap to quick save option. Now I download the pics when I dont have a specific board for it to go to. With the Quick Saves and / or the Liked Pins board I didnt have to fill up my phone storage and could easily re-organize pins if I wanted to. I'd love to see it brought back. Or at least give the user an option to turn it off/on.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it but could improve on usability and connectivity to other apps. Update: It's getting better and faster but sometimes can't connect to legitimate pages. I wanted to buy a product from Nordstrom Rack after being inspired and the connection was numbing even though l am a fan. I had to go to Google to buy the product. I love the Explore or Shop option when l search for something. It's really handy and useful.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Honesty the pinterest program has been getting worse with every update. The videos play automatically with the volume at its highest setting.

There are better apps available for viewing pictures.,,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I do like Pinterest, it offers new, inspirational ideas about absolutely everything. It shows photos of actual physical products rather than artists impressions. However, Pinterest is a little too invasive.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is an excellent way to reference your favorite DIY videos, gifts, photographs ect. I did prefer the original format. Seeing the number of repins under the pin was preferable to me and many of my descriptions were changed back to the source. I also don't like being bombarded with the same kind of pins. Just because I clicked on an old house doesn't mean I want my page full of photos of abandoned homes.",,,,,,

The most recent update I got now pulls the save menu up from the bottom of the screen, and it makes it harder to find the section you want to save to. I like the old way of saving much better. Secondly, I don't like how Pinterest automatically refreshes when you open the app or go back to the home page. I've lost a lot of good pins due to this. It's a frustrating and unnecessary feature, honestly.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for productive uses, great for developing personal style/tastes, great for passing the time- use it at least daily. Only wish that the ""More ldeas"" section for each board could be based on a longer time period of saved pins. It'd also be great if the platform was more appealing to / popular with artists. The amount of uncredited and/ or stolen art is staggering. Folks clearly want the art there, the source is just absent. Still a great platform with only room to grow and improve.",,,,,,

I also enjoy how it shows posts that are old as well as current rather than letting older posts simply vanish to time.

The organizing function in the boards is very frustrating as well.",,,,,,

There is currently a bug that's been appearing for the last week or so saying 'user not found' which is very annoying.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app which I have used almost everyday. While I do like it, there could be one additional feature to improve the experience. I often find myself pinning two of the same pictures to one board without being notified of the duplicate. The app will tell me in cases of the same exact post however, if there is one picture posted by two or more different people then i won't be notified. Perhaps the app could scan the pictures in my board and see if I had previously pinned anything that looks identical in order to reduce duplicates.",,,,,,

When I click on a pin that interests me, half of the image is cropped away and the text is set to the side of the image in a difficult to read stacked font. Zooming out does not fix this, nor does setting my phone to landscape. Hyperlinks barely work, so I cant link to the origin site. The visit button just freezes the screen.",,,,,,

Adding to boards that are under boards (sub-boards?) from outside sites is a little clunky, but I'm mostly just glad to have sub-boards at all.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest WAS my favorite app, hands down. Now it's quickly becoming a frustrating experience. Repetitive ads, music out of nowhere, random pins on subjects I'm not even remotely interested in choking out the things I actually want to see, having to unfollow boards or profiles that I don't even remember following in the first place, still showing ads that I have hidden, and now most pins I try to save gets saved to 'profile' automatically instead of showing a list of my boards to pick from.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Whoever is in charge of the app design seriously needs to take a break and not change little things here and there every single month. If its not broke dont fix it. Instead of constantly changing the layout of the app maybe focus on optimization of links opened through the app (which is an absolute nightmare) the only good thing so far is the simple variety of content that is accessible.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great photos from a wide range of subjects! I'm very happy with the overall experience. My complaints are: 1) there are too many intrusive ads. 2) there needs to be a way to eliminate subjects I will never have an interest in from my view. 3) reorganizing a board needs to be made more efficient. It should be possible to arrange, say up to 10 pins at a time by tapping on them in an order that I choose and dragging those pins to a new location on the board they're on.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"2 years later & I'm still obsessed! However, why is it soooooo easy to hide pins by mistake? It's easier to do that than to actually pin something to your boards. Then you can't undo or see what you've hidden. Everything I've hidden has been by mistake .. LITERALLY & it's concerning bc a pin I dont see might be the 1 pin I need to make my page blow ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏?. just saying, fixing that would be plus. Possibly a simple ""Are you sure?"" would help. Overall, the app is perfect ‚ù?
March 24"," 2024""",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has so many great ideas, and it does a good job at finding results for vague or even highly specific searches. One thing bothers me, though. Sometimes it will send me a notification of a post it thinks I might like, but when I click on the notification, it takes me to a different post than the one pictured. This has also happened when I am actually in the app. It recommends a post, but when I click on it, it takes me to something different.",,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been with Pinterest just about since it was first created. It used to be great all round. And it still has a lot of good stuff, and I mean, I haven't deleted yet. The issue is the ads. I get it needs some ads to pay to run it, but it's WAAAAY too much! It feels like there's more ads than actual diy/art content now. I also love the new video and slideshow format, but you can't just swipe through pins anymore, which I loved. Also remove the shop option in search plz!!!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE Pinterest - it's my most used App. I'd give 5 stars, but the way the app operates in Android doesn't even compare to how it runs in IOS. Some suggestions for Android developers: 1. Add a side menu w/the alphabet, allowing users to find their boards much quicker and easier. 2. Add the ability to just swipe down and go back to the main page we were just at instead of always having to use the back button. 3. Automatically alphabetize my boards. These 3 suggestions would make it PERFECT!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has some great informational items but there are some others that seem like they are but turn out to be a waist of time. It is fairly easy to use but most of the time. I have problems with changing to different pages (home page, updates, messages, and to my pins) as they tend not to want to show the images for quite some time. Other than that it is a pretty decent app!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Difficulty. I'd give it 5 Stars but Everytime I see something on a specific page with multiple pictures it won't go to the recipe or instructions so i can't find out about it. Secondly, Sometimes I see something I'd like to share with someone but it won't let me share. Lastly, sometimes when I click on ""visit"" to get more information, where it takes me had nothing to do with the picture. Frustrating. When it works, I love it!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Recent update has really really unnecessary features that just make using the app less convenient. The search bar is small and at the bottom of the screen and pops up and disappears. Sometimes it just doesn't come back and you have to actually exit the app just to search for something. Plus there is a huge portion of pins on the homepage that are just ads being promoted.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest offers miscellaneous things. It's very helpful to go to one place and find many options with a quick topic search. I can easily search for a workout, a motivational quote or a recipe. What I don't like is that sometimes I save the same thing multiple times because it doesn't recognize it as the same thing. It would be convenient if it tied the same files together, so that when I go save something several months later, it recognizes that I already saved it before.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The setup of ""boards"" and ""pins"" is very pleasant to view and use. The links connected to the pictures are rewards to your interest in the photos. The ads are frequent and mostly uninteresting. The options to describe blocking certain are not sufficient. There should be an ""uninteresting"" choice. Irrelevant is not a correct description. This app loads quickly and is an excellent ""filing system"" for storing ideas.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like that I can download an image via its thumbnail. However, the interface is extremely disorganized, inconsistent & borderline glitchy. Sometimes I can tap ""..."" from the thumbnail to save a pin, other times that option isn't available (requires a long-tap). This needs to be consistent. Notifications are also out of control. A weekly report of saves/shares would be nice. Adding a pin to multiple boards at once (instead of opening the save options every time) would also be great.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this app but w/every update there's some change that's made the experience not as great as it once was. Wish they would bring back the ""explore"" option w/all of the category lists to click and browse, not just explore from your already made boards/interests. If I'm looking at one pin and go further down and select another, and do that again several times, sometimes the app will just jump back to home screen- making me lose my whole trail. Tons of bad click-thru links you can't fix",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest. It is a wonderful collection of ideas. It is fun and easy to use, but there are a few issues.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest for the simple fact that's a social media sight for you personally.It caters itself to the things you like and branches off to the things you potentially will like. It can go from the fashions, music, food, cooking, housing, health, gardening, shopping and etc. Though it still has problems, one is that some of the websites you try to buy on dont work, also I still think the music you can find is limited, and when search some sites it limited to how far you can search.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A few suggestions - It would be nice if the pop-ups showed up on the bottom of the screen rather than up when saving a pin. Covers the screen and ruins the experience. Also loading times and animations could be a little smoother, even though they've improved a lot. The algorithm for pins is a little wack. I don't want my page full of the same type of pins after I save just one. Overall, 3/5 stars.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I came back to Pinterest after not using it for a while. There are so many ads, broken links, etc. The ""did you find what you're looking for"" constantly takes up space as well. Images can't be downloaded either. I'd rather just search google to find what I'm looking for and save it to my phone. I've wasted enough time trying to get around all the obstacles of using Pinterest.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"UX used to be easy. Ex: Now if you search for something, click on a result and try swiping to view the results of your first search, it doesn't work anymore. You also can't save pins from a simple shortcut button anymore, everything takes at least 3 clicks now, not to mention the extra clicks if you want to specify the section of a board. This was one of the most fluid apps, and you need that fluidity when you're doing creative research. Now the UI just makes you lose your flow so why bother",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a great way to express yourself, and find images and some videos of what you currently love. You are able to create boards based on things you like, from anime to crafts. You can have it stay organized and clean, by adding sections into boards. although it does slow you down if you want to/need to save things fast, only because you have to click on the board itself, then find and choose the section you want. other than that, its a great app for all ages",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this app on a daily basis, for a good amount of the day. It updates now and again, and lately, the updates to the interface, appearance, and navigation, have gotten, in my opinion, worse. Mind I use a mobile the majority of the time. I've yet to see what the latest update looks like on a PC. But, the search mechanic is at the bottom rather than the top, the profile layout changed, and sub-boards are painful. It's gotten slower, as well. I liked best the workings from a few updates before.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has definitely made a lot of things easier. I'm grateful that it has tutorials for art, inspiration for resin and polymer crafts, and an overall ease-of-access way to make mood boards, collections, and so on. Very good way to store links and the like! My only gripe is that sometimes those who share on it do not credit the original artists, but this isn't actually on Pinterest or their fault at all.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. But really would have been better if there was a pop-up delete button instead of going all the way through edit pin hassle just to delete the pin. And you must definitely add an unsend pin option in chats because the moment you accidentally long press on screen while scrolling through the app, it has already sent a totally unrelated pin to totally unrelated person before you could even process what just happened.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've always loved Pinterest, it inspired me a lot. I only use it to browse pictures, the only videos I watch are some ads that are suggested to me. I still like the app a lot, but somehow for the past 6 months or so, I feel the quality of the recommended content has decreased. I really wish there was less ads (while I understand the need for it) and a possibility to select what content I want to be suggested on my homepage, and not just get content based on the last few images I've watched.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update: they did an update and fixed the problem of reordering your pins. You still can, but it is listed as an edit. I have changed my star rating.

At least make it an option where you can turn it off in the settings.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would have given this app about 4-5 stars a couple months ago. But now, my experience with the app is absolutely frustrating to deal with. The most notable being the ""saving to profile"" feature. I get that it may be more convenient for some people, but PLEASE, for those of us where that isn't the case, allow us to change it to the way saving pins worked before. Whether it be a toggle in settings or elsewhere, I would just like a way to turn this feature off because it is NOT helpful for me.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works well but I would love to see a type of ""to do"" board/list option added. I plan a week out of meals or tasks on paper or on my phone but in a separate app. What if Pinterest did it all? You can check things off as you do it, it would prompt you to save, move or delete that pin after checking it off. Also, it could ask what your thought of the pin afterwards. I make recipes all the time and never review them because I just don't think about it, this would make you think about it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy Pinterest. There is a wide variety of subjects available to view. Many things of interest to me are free to download, which i appreciate. The quality is always first-rate. Pinterest also directs one to similar topics outside its own boundaries should a more in-depth knowledge be required.

On some of the videos I get only a blank screen when I click on it. This mainly seems to happen after I have clicked on and viewed several videos in a row. Would like for the phone app to have a few more capabilities for searches and file management.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The idea behind this app is wonderful! It has a wide range of pins for all sorts of interests, provids us with a whole new set of ideas, it allows us to add our own set of pins, there is also a feature to chat with friends and share pins, accout privacy is very good. However, the app has stopped responding multiple times. It either shuts down on it's own or it just doesn't open. The website works perfectly fine but the app on the phone malfunctions a lot. It doesn't allow me to log in anymore.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for some time now and I've always really liked it as a reference source that isn't limited to one social media platform. I also like the way boards are implemented but with the last update, there's this black fade at the top of each pin that looks really unprofessional and annoying. What's the point of tapping on a pin if the picture has this weird filter at its top. Its just an unfitting design choice and really distracting to me.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When pinterest was first developed it was amazing. Able to view others' boards without pop-up ads ruining the entire experience. Now there are at least two ads per view. One at the top and one at the bottom. After one ad ends, video of cooking, crafts, etc plays on top of what I'm trying to view. Very annoying. This isn't part of the app, but some feel it is necessary to thrust the product to the camera. STOP IT. Not cool. Makes me stop watching you.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app still seems to lack the skintone feature that was added at start of the year. As a person of colour it would be great to have narrowed down search results for areas such as beauty, fashion and hairstyles, just to have it more personalized. Edit: it's now 2021 and the skintone feature is still unavailable. Disappointing to say the least.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There was a problem with images loading for awhile, but the tech department responded quickly and fixed the problem within a week.

Definitely one of the best apps ever!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app honestly! The things that bother me are the ""back"" and ""magnifying glass"" symbol on the top left and down right corner that sometimes cover the image I'm seeing. Also, I hope the notification tab would be easier to use, the current one is kinda hard to keep track. I think this one is hard, but I wish it'd be easier for fans/regular users to report reposted artworks with no credit",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Two things. First and foremost, what kind of ""blocking"" is it when I can still see ""blocked"" accounts on my feed? All 'blocking' does is it's making me unable to pin posts from an account I'm not interested in anyway. Exceptionally useful. Well done on that one. Second, I don't want Pinterest to autoplay videos ever. The app needs an option to turn this off. Or, at the very least, to keep the upcoming videos muted once I mute the first one that starts blasting noise I don't want to hear.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had Pinterest for a while now, and I enjoy it. But after the update with the ""creators"" I can't tap on the top bar to look at pins for specific boards. I also go to the settings to turn off Show Shopping Recommendations, the switch is turned to off, so I close the window, and then when I open the page again, it is turned back on. The comment section is super buggy and never works, it says that there is X comments but when I open the section, there isn't any comments, or less than X.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for a couple years now. I've hated a lot of the changes, but I find myself coming back every holiday season to use it. At its core, this app is made for creative minds looking to compile pieces of the internet for their projects. Writing prompts for writers or a list of funky names for DnD. Pinterest has it. The ads have become quite plentiful and overwhelming sadly. The ""story"" feature doesn't help me at all. Overall, core is great, all the fluff not so much.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has been going strong for years. I feel comfortable storing and organizing images on my profile. The algorithm is fairly strong, so it frequently shows me things I could not otherwise find. I generally prefer using Pinterest as an image search engine over Google. I have recently had some issues with censorship of art that contains nudes. Censoring art that contains the human form doesn't make sense for the purpose of this website.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Only downloaded this to look at a few Art Nouveau images. Not worth it for the SERIOUSLY AGGRESSIVE FEED. Several times a day I got notifications from the app itself followed by a separate email. Really clogged up my inbox. Made no difference to adjust my settings, still kept getting notifications, they had just changed to subjects I had zero interest in (and yes, I DID tick the Unsubscribe To All box!) Eventually I had to uninstall, and will be keeping it that way. You have been warned....",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. There have been some recent changes though that I really don't like. The app is glitchy and crashes or doesn't load properly. The 'explore' feature is gone, the new little magnifying glass in the corner of every picture makes text on a picture illegible, the ads play sound automatically, and there are so, so many ads. I get that ads are necessary but good night, it's a lot. Stop tweaking the app.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app it's just lately it recommends things on my boards that are nothing like I have saved. This will always be my favorite app, though. -update it's gotten worse. so many little bugs pop up here and there, videos are choppy and take forever to fully play, i have 2 accounts, and the features are completely different. The app is downgrading, i feel, but i still love it and will hope these things get fixed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how simple and easy it is to control the app. I always find what i'm looking for, which makes me super happy. Everything is just so aesthetic and cute. The ideas and the inspirations makes me love the app even more. This app is basically perfect if you're an artist, many new creations, ideas and references you can get inspired from. Logging in was quite difficult though, but it was worth the struggle.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: still terrible. Almost all suggested pins are videos and aren't at all related to my saved pins. Many of the pins feature an image with a strange caption, and when you click the link it ends up being a hidden ad for something completely unrelated. Ew. Newer version is completely ad-centric and doesn't show as many personalized pins anymore. The majority of the discover feed is drowned in sponsored pins. The recipe view is also sluggish and frustrating because of how many ads there are.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is great. But there are far too many ad pins. Pretty much one in every 4 or 5 pins seem to be ""promoted"". I wish there was a pay option to reduce or eliminate ads... just degrades the overall experience. Also the embedded web browser is terrible. I always have to click to open in another browser just to get most pages to function properly.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall amazing app if you want to find references, ideas, and other cool stuff! Some minor problems if you're new to Pinterest; Lag. The lag isn't that bad but sometimes it's very annoying when you're trying to load something but it doesn't work, second, Internet. If you have bad internet, sometimes it won't show your page or your profile account, even ends up not getting fixed for a few weeks or days. And lastly, the problem with the messaging feature is kinda buggy... That's all I have to say",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I love this app incredibly much. It's such an awesome place for creative minds to get their ideas organized and search for inspiration. It has helped me many times where other apps really couldn't and there are a lot of good finds, from recipes, to style guides, to crafting projects, to art, i love it! can only recommend!! (also love the new tried that option, but i've noticed that it's only to be found under some pins, but it would be great to have that option under every pin). Love",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app since the beginning. I absolutely love it. My biggest complaint is the way it has changed your default page. It used to be a listing of the pins that all the people you follow have posted and a few new options based on your categories. Now supposedly it ""learns"" what you like and only shows you that. For example if I search for a pie recipe the next time I am on my feed will be exclusively dessert/ food related plus a bazillion ads. I want the more random feed!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is truly awesome! It has improved in the past years. I can find everything I need for my idea base on any field... it's truly great and helpful. ü•∞ But i hope they add a feature to make the 'section' of a board to an individual 'board'. I made a section but i feel like it should be an individual board... so hope they can add that feature üôÉ,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has always been one of the best apps. I knew I could trust pinterest for ideas, instruction, and inspiration until lately. I'm having a hard time finding things that would usually be found on the home page and were relevant to my interests. I keep trying to hide all of the alcohol advertisements. I mark them as ""not for me"" over and over and still have to continue to mark those and inappropriate words or pins with inappropriate content but it still appears. I'm disappointed with that.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest for it's amazing inspiration! However, nowadays, the site leans heavily on the ""history"" of the persons previous pin saves. In the past you would see a wide range of topics but now..... When you click on any pin expect to see only those topics in your feed. I have to constantly clear out my history, which wouldn't be a problem if there was an easy clear button buuuut there isn't so I have to clear out each pin one by one.... It's a nightmare....",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i love this app. Very good for organizing pretty much all kinds of ideas. However recently they seem to have gotten rid of the ability to organize how you see your own boards, such as list view. This was much easier for me to navigate and I dont know why it was taken away, unless I can't find it. I find this default view very confusing for my eyes and would prefer if i could choose again.. Would really appreciate if this feature was brought back.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app. I've never had any problems other than just a plain old operator error. I have no issue with ads since they don't interrupt me in the middle of doing something. The pin selection is outstanding. I actually have to force myself to unplug from it or I'd spend hours browsing and building boards. If there were more stars to check highlight, you can bet that they'd be shining bright! Thank you for this wonderful app! üôè",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly my favourite app ever. However, the one thing that bothers me, is the Watch feature. Most of the videos on there have been pretty good, but recently I've been getting several videos in languages I don't really understand. When I get those, I always press the hide pin button, which then gives me an option to say that it's not in the correct language. But after I do that, it proceeds to give me more videos in the incorrect language. But other than that, highly recommend it :)",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't want to sound petty but I uninstalled this app because I can't swipe to see the next picture. Every other app out there has swipe functionality so it becomes inconvenient that it's not there. The user experience becomes interrupted when you have to click on the back arrow and then click on the next image individually. And then repeat all over. The rest of the app is good though, I like the idea of pinterest. But wish I could use it more comfortably.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for years. I love this app. But the last update is absolutely infuriating. The random profile board? It's in the way and it is absolutely inconvenient. The system with saving pins to your own boards was better, bring that back. The toolbar at the bottom causes issues when opening the app. You can't expand comment replies a majority of the time. It's just becoming so useless.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite pastime!!! ...And a very accessable place to put my favorite picture files, and the research articles I want to save for later use. With as many boards as I have, it's the best way to save all the information in an accessable portable place. Also, it's great to have when in consultation with others, no matter the topic (especially as a costumer)!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest; it is so good to have an open forum dedicated to image sharing, and nothing else necessarily involved. A great visual encyclopedia, and thus one of the most important forms of social media, in my opinion, in the era of mobile phone photography. And generally, a gentle one, as well. But with the capacity for being informative and educational. And without the dimension of coercion and opinion being inevitably embedded within its framework. Full marks to all of you!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updates keep adding new features that are bad? Why is there a grey haze at the top of an image? It makes it hard to SEE the image. Same with the search button on the lower right, why have that when tapping the image gives you the same option? It covers up things! Why are we having videos without progress bars or the ability to MUTE? it's so annoying!! We're going BACK in tech not forward with that üò≠",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really appreciate the idea of Pinterest, but the whole point of it is to have a more direct experience with content. When you choose to view something, more than HALF the screen is menus and options, let alone the shopping tags that show up on every single item in the photo. Can you zoom in? Nope! But you can visit their website with tons more ads and subscription pop ups! It makes for a very clunky and restrictive experience. Organizing different photos for yourself is the only positive.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pinterest is a one of a kind App. I've been on it since before 2014. I used to collect a lot more than I do now. It got to be too much. I have like 2 dozen subjects with hundreds of photos in each. And a few are Private (locked of from the Public) which is very convenient. But Pinterest is definitely my go to App for finding photos or drawings of a certain subject. And I can also save it directly to one of those two dozen subject. With the touch of a button. I also can connect to my Evernote.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app but the block button is right next to the save pin button when you hold onto the image and just slide to the one you want. This has lead to me blocking a lot of pins I wanted to save and I just feel like they shouldn't be right next to each other. Other than that the app I'd great and a good way to find recipes or just past the time.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good but needs work. Hate the video ads with a passion and also hate the amount of images which are 'items for sale', if I wanted to buy the items, I would click through. I get that its a free app but you are over doing it with the advertising. Also with the boards, wheres the option to remove 'profile', I don't want to sort my images that way. Also can you fix the algorithm so that the most used boards and most relevant sit at the top.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's so much I could say, but I think the thing I've freaked out over to my family most is the INCREDIBLE ALGORITHM. My homepage is always so so inspiring and gives me more than enough of a creative fix when in a slump. Another quick thing, the ""notes"" feature is brilliant. Absolutely love it. If there's one thing I'd suggest it would be to allow notes to be attached to sections as well as specific pins, but even that's not that big of a deal. Great app.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using Pinterest so much. I use it almost everyday. I would say that it could be better in terms of organization and personalization, though. You can custom-sort on your own profile, but when saving a pin; it only sorts from A to Z. It is also incredibly frustrating that you can't have sections, within other sections. It would be so satisfying to have sections inside of sections, instead of having tons of boards. I would use Pinterest literally everyday for hours if it had more sections!",,,,,,

It gets worse with each update. Videos are a cool idea but you can't rewind on many. They've added a feature where it'll play once then an option to follow pops up that won't disappear. I guess you have to follow to replay it but since I refused I have no idea. The only thing that keeps me from deleting is the hope it'll morph back into something useful.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app crashed so I thought it was due to the update. Tried to update it and it couldn't complete that. Uninstalled it and tried to install it back to see if it would work but its stuck at 68% and won't progress. Honestly it worked better before the updates. Classic example of fixing something that wasn't broken and managing to completely ruin it. Hoping they can fix whatever problem it has now because it's an amaizing app for inspiration and I love it (but the bugs make it terrible) fix it!,,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really adore Pinterest; it's been a part of my daily routine as an artist and a person who enjoys the aesthetics. However, Pinterest has been undergoing a huge downgrade throughout fhe past few years, with the amount of ads that are being shown multiplying (it's almost ridiculous, really) and one of the most important features to me, as an artist, disappearing: the ""i tried this pin"" way of posting a drawing to a reference, to connect with and get inspired by other artists. Bring it back!!",,,,,,

Now they have added large black rounded areas at the top of posts that block even more of the images. It is getting to be unusable.,,,,,,

But last few days the main page is usable in terms of saving an image now. I can no longer long press to save images quickly or share with friends and it's frustrating open each thing individually to save it... I can't find a setting that could've possibly done this and so idk how to find out how to fix it... Not to mention so many ads it's next to impossible to accurately find what I want.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update makes it really tedious and annoying to save something. I have to scroll all the way down to the board I actually want to use, every single time, the auto save to profile feature just makes board filling time consuming and hard to find if you mess up. It's so much easier to just save to what you previously saved something as, and then change from there. Also been having completely irrelevant pins all over my dash that won't go away eventhough I have no boards enabled for them.",,,,,,

Pinterest has enriched my life especially during Covid and I probably pop on 2 the three times a day. The pop-up ads can be very annoying and difficult to remove. I understand a lot of Revenue comes from advertising but after I see the ad I'd like to easily get it out of my frame of view. I like the option of shopping or just viewing the posts and wish sales posts were a little more obvious.,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The idea behind the existence of Pinterest is actually great, but Im not sure why the team in charge for maintaining or developing the system leave some grave annoying deficiencies.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, except for two big issues... they switched things up, and now when I try to search for my saved pins, it doesn‚Äôt open all my pins that fit the keywords, something it used to do... they also throw in pins that are not from my boards. The other issue it that, you used to be able to quickly scroll through your boards by lightly pressing the far fight margin, which made searching boards, especially when pinning, much faster. Fix those things and they'll get a 5-star rating.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app & think it's a wonderful way to save and organize pictures etc. Though, in order for me to give you 5 stars some tweaking has to be done. I would like to: * Be able to search for boards (like you can when using a PC) when I'm saving a pin. * Edit the cover photo for a board. * Narrow down searches to only show boards. * More randomization when using the same search words. * See what board a pin belongs to and be able to go right to it. * A one-tap Follow option.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have used pinterest for years and it was amazing all the cool things I could find on there! Then, it started going downhill when they took away the discover tab. It is now so hard to find things you are looking for! I was so nice to have everything so neatly organized in categories. Now, with the following tab, it is a mess. I can't click on the pins to see similar things, it just sends me straight to the website. Also, what algorithm it uses to display pins on my feed is nuts. Just because I pin a few things out of a category does not mean I want to see everything in that category. Also, when looking at a pin, the magnifying glass covers the bottom of the pin, obscuring the words so I can't see them. I think the only good thing that has come from the update is how you can go on your own boards and click to see more things similar to what is on your board. I just to love Pinterest, but now it has just become annoying to use.",,,,,,

Wished they kept the dark/light mode switch, as someone with a older device having the any/most apps in light mode can be irritating- I more prefer the dark mode.

Lots, and lots of chicken recipes. It buries other things. So instead of seeing recipes, sewing tips and true crime, 90% will be chicken related. It might seem trivial though.",,,,,,

It was better when you could search for boards and I hate having writing under the pins. It is messy and ruins the flow. If I want info about the pin I would click on it.

Pinterest keeps getting in the viewers way by urging us to pin things, making a pop-up on things we are already viewing.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love Pinterest because it's a great useful and inspiring app however... the last update brought back some previous problems such as the impossibility to swipe smoothly through search results which is terribly frustrating.

Another thing that changed is that I can't edit or delete multiple pins from boards I've created..,,,,,,

It appears that they are resting on their laurals, and keeping us from progressing with ideas. I wonder if they update the site or just use people's ideas in vain. Just Say'ng. Byl Butler",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know most people say Pinterest is so 2014, but this app is criminally underrated. It isn't just for weddings, it's helped me with ideas for renovating & decorating my house. This algorithm is so spot-on, which has led me to find even more pins I love. The best thing about boards is that you can see trends in what you're drawn to. Also, I've never had the app crash when I've used it & I love that some boards can be secret. Even though I never use that feature, I just like having the option.",,,,,,

I wish the platfo m automatically added posts from all around the web, so I could find related things a bit easier, and not just the top choices that the app decides to show you. I also often have to go to Google to find the source and other related content, but since there aren't options to search with Google lens (that I'm aware of) or whatever other browser you might use, I'm often just stuck.",,,,,,

First of all, I can't see my followers list and follower notifications (I can't follow my friends) I aslo can't send any pins because my messages disappear or say 'something is wrong, try again later'. Once I open a pin and save it and go back, the page gets refreshed or sends me way up to the top. Many are facing the same problems so Pinterest please fix this as soon as possible! üòîüíñ",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app before but after the new update, its so hard to use. You can't move multiple pins at once anymore which used to be one of the best features on this app. You can't organize your boards anymore because there's too many buttons you have to press just to move or delete a pin. Plus the app freezes way too much. It's too complicated now. Please change it back.",,,,,,

The over abundance of ads, and the frequent glitches, the most recent one being when you get notifications, but it tells you there ARE no notifications. Please fix this. EDIT: Now when I try to move pins to other boards, I can't do it. It seems like this app gets worse with each update. Changing my rating from 3 stars to 2. 2ND EDIT: Still no improvement, and now I can't create new sections on my boards.",,,,,,

For example, reorganizing pins is a wonderful concept. But when put into work it is overall useless and stressful. In terms of bugs: pins won't save, they duplicate, pins not saving in sections, and more.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,New update has left my pintrest seldomly useable. 80% of the time I open the app and it won't load the home page at all even with full service and/or wifi. Most things I click on won't load or do so very slowly. Sometimes it takes me to a beginners tutorial and won't let me click on anything. I really like pintrest but probably will be deleting the app.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Out of nowhere sounds, defaulting back to the home page after saving a pin, missing chat icon. The updates are getting strange and pushing the app to unusable territory. The menu bar should be customizable and the search bar that disappears when you scroll should be brought back. I liked having a full screen of pins where I just had to pull down to see the search bar or category/quick search tabs. And I want the option to go to the home screen mid article in the settings not as a default.",,,,,,

It must be an update problem, because this was not an issue pre-update.",,,,,,

NeedA custom MySpace type page is deff key to keeping some users.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,favourite app by far. I can spend hours being lead through a maze like vortex of visual inspirations. I pin constantly creating folders to refer back to if ever stuck for an idea. But its more than that. It has a personality you create by your choices. Its like a comfortable but exciting friend. I think I love you Pinterest. But seriously it is my favourite app. It does seem to have better images than google. Its nearly as good as going to the Library but better because the library comes to you.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love it but I recently discovered that the app can actually send emails to random people who are in my surroundings without my permission to send the emails and I kinda feel uncomfortable about it .,,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I do involves Pinterest!! I use it every day. Most days I use the app multiple times. I never dreamed I would use any app as much as Google but......... It's real close. Not sure if I was forced to give up one which one it would be. Anyone that hasn't discovered Pinterest is missing out for sure!!!!! There are so many things to like but if I had to pick a favorite feature it would probably be how when I go to the home screen it's all the things I like and have been researching.,,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app and scrolled through it all of the time. Now this app has run me off. I agree with most of the recent complaints.. the app stops after scrolling just a few things.. etc. But my biggest complaint is the home feed. It will only show the same things over and over and beware if you click anything. You'll see a variation of that thing over and over ad nauseum. I accidently clicked something about curly hair. Now my feed ONLY shows me curly hair posts..my hair is stick straight.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to be able to use pinterest to create idea boards. Now it's mainly unrelated ads and links that lead to more ads. I may as well use Instagram and Amazon /: Make Pinterest Great Again 2024!!,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is a good app for people who want art ideas or just anything. But the only problem im facing is that the messages that we send are sent but the replies dont come immediately. We have to go out of the app and then go to the messages tab and then only we can see the message. This is the reason why im giving it a 4 star. Rest everything is great! Pls fix the problem.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,honestly the app is amazing. I genuinely enjoyed pinning and all of the content I would see. however recently the app crashes whensver I open it. wither that or it repeats pins over and over again but definitely crashes a lot.

It's confusing and annoying to navigate pins and move from page to page. There have been a lot of unnecessary updates that I don't believe anyone was asking for.

Please change it, the way everyone is asking you to change it.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to have an account but I would get flagged for saving pins that I see on someone else's account. How does that make sense? I respected the rules and guidelines but saving another's pin and my account gets flagged for it does not make for a good report.

You can also find some cool stuff in here. Wonderful to collect interssting images. Just a great app in general.

No way of sharing pictures, only pins. 4. You can't reply to messages. 5. Chat constantly freezes. Please fix this, if you add a messaging function you should at least optimize it.",,,,,,

Even more frustrating is navigating sites through the app. If i click through to a blog or etsy listing, its very buggy and won't flip through pics or scroll up and down. I have to open in browser for anything to work.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app would be better if it actually knew what its own community guidelines were instead of just removing anything that gets reported or looks like it could violate guidelines but doesn't.

They need to get their act together",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to love this but with each new update it because worse. The most recent update got rid of two of my favourite features that made finding pins so easy. When searching for something the mini tabs that used to appear at the top has now gone which I loved. The addition of videos/stories is so pointless. Just should have stuck to what Pinterest was good at. The essence and uniqueness of the app is changing and essentially ruining it.,,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's the best app with soo much variety of each and everything and even we can search other things also even though we didn't select them. I recommend all of you to download this app. At anytime you can download any image of your choice so easily. And later on you can find in ur gallery. We can create our own folders so that we could get confused. It's a very very gud app. Those who are thinking to install it you have toüòÇdownload it...excellent app. Keep it up...super app. And even my favorite,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I would say this app this perfect for ideas, diy, art and other crafts too, let it be book recommendations, tourist spots, websites for students, cute drawing and on the other hand we can also find fan arts and memes relating the topic. This app is pretty much good for a student or an adult because it has evryone needs. I usually use this app for the nice quality pictures they provide. They also let us hide pins we don't want to see, block them etc. We can save the pictures and boards too.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the most amazing app. Can be used for fun as well as for gaining knowledge. One can save the pins on different boards. Boards like Art, fashion, food, quotes, games and many more. Sharing pins with people via pinterest or any other app can be done. Also, short videos are available for viewing. You can post your own pins and videos as well and can follow others for viewing theirs. The app is easy to use. Whenever you refresh you get to see new set of pins. Hiding pin option is available üåà",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you like crafting/DIY, you're probably on Pinterest to share techniques and ideas with peers; unfortunately, in many (though not all) DIY categories, so many search results are well-disguised promotions that useful tutorials are the proverbial needle in the haystack. I don't mind ads, but I do mind when ads TOTALLY supplant real content, as they have on Pinterest recently. It's worse than any other app I use by a long shot because ads replace content rather than appearing beside it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it often bugs and says my account is gone or my boards, the pins stretch and glitch and show a completely different photo (but when i click on it it shows the actual one, hard to explain) and often cant save a pic to the gallery",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app for saving sites and ideas I find online, but it's getting to the point that there are too many ads and they are annoyingly repetitive, having nothing to do with my interests. The feed also has been narrowed to interests that were most recently viewed, rather than a more well rounded sample of my overall interests. So unfortunately, I've been using it far less than I once did.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had the app for years but I use it less and less because of all the ads cluttering up my feed. I especially hate when I select a pin and random audio starts playing from an ad I can't see and I can't tell where it's coming from. I have to close the app to get it so stop and it's so embarrassing when it happens in public. I've even disabled auto play and it still happens to me. I also hate that if you search something once pinterest never forgets, and recommends similar pins forever üôÑ",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Annoying! The little menu in the middle bottom of the screen keeps disappearing so I have to close the app and reopen it to get it back. Then every single pin I see that blue bubble telling me to tap for a reaction. Yes I get it, I don't want to. There should be an X or way to keep it from constantly popping up. Also whenever I have a pin open on my screen, then I switch windows to answer a text, when I go back to Pinterest, it refreshes to the home page, and I have no navigate to that pin again",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In a nutshell, glitches, onslaught advertising, non moderated, bieng blamed for inappropriate content via email every other day, pins end up on boards I know I didn't put them on. Developers, please get your S$%^ together.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have always loved this app. Recently the app must have updated because instead of having a ton of pins to scroll through both on my main feed and while searching, there is hardly any. I have to constantly refresh the feed and I don't find much when searching. It also deleted all the pins my husband and I have sent back and forth so now we can't look back at them.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So so many ads. I have to sift through too much to look at what I'm actually looking for. As others have said, I too would MUCH RATHER pay for it and not see ads. Pinterest used to be a fun and useful tool and now it's the same as all the other platforms, way less useful and the consumer ends up feeling used. I keep it around for my old recipes etc but I've been using Google search and images to find what I'm looking for with better success these days.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Sometimes the feature that lets you search for things or view your own boards disappears and does not come back for quite some time. I've tried scrolling up and down and restarting the app to make it reappear and it does not work. I use Pinterest for reference photos for my art. It can be pretty annoying when you're in the middle of a project.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This apps gone through a lot of updates, and I feel like features which should stay the same keep changing like the interface of the pc version versus the phone version. Also with more and more ads being allowed to post I've encountered way more crashes. The ads are also intrusive, if I have volume up sometimes ads will blare videos that wont stop until i close the whole app. I love you pinterest but you're a bit of a hot mess.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Right now its a one, I've had Pinterest for a couple of years and just recently it has been freezing up when I try to view an item or try to download something. I have never encountered this til after the recent update. I may just have to start looking for another app to enjoy. I sent a feedback this morning and it froze up with that too. Darn...I loved this too, how easy it was to share what Pinterest had. I'll give it a few more days.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"pinterest right now is practically garbage. You cant swipe to naviguate through pins which doesnt make sense because thats one of the most basic functions of a smartphone. Absolutely hate the default quick saves board that you cant opt out of. a hassle to recategorise pins later one by one. Its also public and lacks the privacy one might wish to have. The links to products advertised on the pictures themselves should be in a ""more"" option or something so as not to ruin viewer experience.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Especially for keeping my recipes all in one place. The only thing I wish I could do on here is add tags to my pins so I can search easier. Like ""healthy,"" ""easy meals,"" and ""chicken recipes"". That stuff is not always in the pin's description, and I'd like to have multiple tags for different thing. They have an option to group pins within a board, but it's not comprehensive. Despite that small thing, I still love this app.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really dont like the new update! Now pins automatically save to my profile instead of popping up with the option to save it to a board. So for every picture I save theres this extra step of having to go in and change it. Its only a couple extra clicks but it gets really annoying when im saving a lot of pictures. The gradients at the top of pins is also a weird addition that no one appreciates!,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oooo i hate that you've put a border at the top of the clicked on picture and put the side menu (three dots symbol) there as well. It covers a good almost 1/3 of the image. Makes reading things extremely difficult. Details cant be seen up there as it's in the way. If artists wanted a black gradiant border covering their a work, they would've put one.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New feedback. This app is great but it's becoming annoying. There's too many glitches, you can't check your follow or anything without having to reopen the app where it turns your screen grey blank, you can't save pins most times where it glitches, you can't open your profile either or it goes blank. It works great for a short amount of time then goes all glitchy on you. Please fix this issue so it can be great again.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Growing stale. I've noticed loading pins in the app from certain sites takes forever! Picture quality on most of the pins I find are terrible to the point of being unreadable. There's a lot of adverts on the main page so I only use the search. Also the regular Pinterest beefs, too many of the same pins coming up in searches, broken links, spam links. It's not what it used to be.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has been great for me until recently. The home page of Pinterest has been stuck on the same things, and it won't refresh. I've tried to close the app and open it, restart my phone, update the app, and reinstall it but nothing has worked. I'm hoping this could be fixed, Pinterest has been one of my top used apps and I would hate to lose it.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I spend hours on this app and it's really great at personalizing your home page based on what you save. However, recently I've been getting more and more ads and videos about fashion, food, etc that I really dont care about and I dont know why they keep popping up. Regardless this is still one of the most entertaining apps I own.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Okay... Please get your app together. Don't make settings for things if that aren't gonna work. Stop flooding my feed with ads. I have already made 3 accounts just becuease no matter what I did, my newsfeed eventually became only ads for things I don't even care about. I have repeatedly turned off all of the search recommendations, I have turned off the 'taking ads from other search engines' and none of it works. I am going to have to uninstall this app if this doesn't serve my purposes anymore.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tbh, the app is useful, but as other people said, it's getting harder and harder to navigate with every update. As someone who uses this app for work everyday it's really annoying, instead of fixing random things that were better before (hiding the boards and topics followed, adding an ""all pins"" board no one asked for), what about adding more functionalities? Subcategories, tags, notes but better, things that actually help?? The one thing that was working was the filter to search boards for ex",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is not as terrific or as comfortable to use as it used to be. It seems that all it is now is ad after ad after ad after ad, and that is exactly how it is, in layers yet. It is tiring, annoying, and off setting. There has to be a better way, and it should the developers that figure it out and correct the situation if they care about the customer base.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not loving the new rounded corners. It leaves black edges that are jarring whole looking through pins. Preferred the previous user interfaceas it was more familiar, easier to use, flowed better, and was easier on the eyes. Also didn't crop the edges of pins so hard. The new rounded corners and bubbles just don't feel as clean and minimalist.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Pinterest, I use it all the time. I've found some of the best recipes on it that have since become family favorites! Besides the repetitive ads, there is one slightly annoying thing about Pinterest and that's when you search for something once or save something you like, the next time you go on the site it shows you MORE of the same thing you just searched for or saved. Why? I already searched or saved it! Show me different things.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This could be so useful if the app wasn't always constantly loading/reloading ads that the screen jumps around and turns scrolling into random clicks. So much trying to happen at once including hidden auto-playing video pop-ups makes for a frustrating experience. Want to close that video? Too bad, because the X is hidden off the edge of the screen and dragging it on might count as a click on it or another ad under it. I know businesses need to make money but the UI here is awful on mobile.",,,,,,

To be honest I was more interested in scrolling relevant content of my preferred board, than watching random videos, this app's profile as i see is supposed to be based on organised ideas, and now it's less convenient to sort my feed. I hope I'm not the only one missing this feature.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app but no matter how many times u tell the producers of this app that they have glitches that are making the app completely useless they don't fix it. For example used to be u could hold down on a pin and save it from the home screen without having to open the pin itself. This feature no longer exists. Also every time u click on a pin the entire homepage reloads so when u see multiple pins u have to choose one and then the entire page reloads losing the other one u wanted.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love pintrest. The app is okay. There are always flaws. The one thing, the one flaw, that completely ruins the experience for me right now is the magnifying glass in the bottom right corner. It is so dark it blocks the bottom right corner and I can't see behind it. I usually find fun quotes or Tumblr quotes, and 2 sentences on the bottom right side are blocked. I have to actually click the silly magnifying glass just to see beyond it even though that feature is meant to search for like content",,,,,,

And, far too often there are so many ads, I can't find what it was I was interested in within the page.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love using Pinterest and have gotten some wonderful ideas from here. I wish the app developer was able to create some kind of program that automatically deleted pins that no longer went anywhere. At least 25% of the time the pin that I'm interested in has a read more button that either goes to a completely irrelevant page or goes to a page where you get a message that says the page no longer exists.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is a fun app alright, you get to search for photos you want to search for. But my only concern is that you can't open the app easily, and it keeps on saying ""Authentication Failed"" or ""No Internet Connection"" though my internet is stable, there are some bugs though, like login fails. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but I couldn't open my account and it bothers me a lot, please fix this soon!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really like Pinterest. I used to LOVE it. Since I began using the app a few thing have changed that completely altered my experience & have definitely lowered my rating. The interface has shifted & now includes so much advertising that it alters my overall enjoyment.This undermines a sense of trust. If I click on an image then there is a strong possibility that the image is just an advertising hook fishing for consumers with white dots littering the page. This ruins the image & wastes my time.,,,,,,

A few small tweaks would make it better such as better editing capabilities / options for pin boards",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Pinterest algorithm seems more ad-based and less UX based. My primary use of the app is for organizing personal ideas and recipes, and the vast majority of accesses is me opening the app to quickly search MY pins/boards.

Its annoying, a bit frustrating, but generally i can locate whatever it is thru a google search.",,,,,,

Only suggestion if i may be so bold, is to suggest a better home page profile setup to open with first, so one can choose to work with boards and pins first and then seek out additional pins. Also make it easier to delete titles of boards no longer required. For example i am an artist and my board for nudes was misconstrued i find it difficult to rename the board.

Whenever I feel like I'm losing my creative focus I just look over my saved pins or search and I'm back where I wanted to be again. My only problem is the lack of credit for artists. You find the most beautiful work yet most of the time there is nowhere to find creator to see more of their work. I don't know if this can be resolved completely but it would help out a bunch.",,,,,,

I miss where you could search by a theme, now it is hard to just browse pins because when I search for something, it always seems to be the same output of pins. The amount of ads are ridiculous. It is like every 4th pin is an ad. And turning the screen black just made it hard to see the pins, thankfully I found where you could change it back. I miss the pinterest from 5 years ago...",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest and have been using it since almost the beginning. I don't know when or why but there seems to be more and more ads in the feeds. I don't mind the ads on the main feed because they seem to be focused on what I am usually interested in pinning. However, I was going through my boards and realized I have no idea what I have pinned anymore since there are so many ads in there of random things not to do with the board or things that I would never pin for myself. It is very annoying and defeats the purpose of creating different boards. I don't know if my comment makes sense of what I am trying to communicate but I am not impressed with the number of ads in the boards that I have created myself.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While it's all fine and good to get lost down that rabbit hole that is Pinterest, the pins that come with auto playing music are annoying. What's up with that? And no matter how many times you click on the ad options to stop seeing it in your feed, Pinterest brings it right back. It would be nice if it didn't refresh the feed every time you went back to it, so you could pick up where you left off. This is a decent app, but it could be better.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Last update made this app worthless. When I try to save pins it automatically goes to a profile board that I didn't create. After research it says to delete the quick save board and it will stop. This did nothing. I have tried to send messages to Pinterest several different ways but it keeps pulling up errors. If this is not resolved soon I will delete it.,,,,,,

I like to use Pinterest go take notes, so it is really ruining the app for me. If I save the image and then go all the way to the board and click on it to manually add it, I can, but it takes me all the way out of whatever I was scrolling through so I lose my search. And half the time whatever I write doesn't even show up. I'm not sure if it's because I keep all boards private.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wish there logarithms did not kick in so strongly when I'm searching for something. Once I look at one of two items in a search my feed gets overwhelmed with that type of thing. Perhaps you could find a way to ask us if we wanted more items like we just searched for before throwing them all in our feed. Also I really filled all the weight loss stuff. Enough already!,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. Being a visual person I really enjoy scanning through all the images that are presented. The fact that you create 'boards' of visual ideas from other people's boards is super and each folder or 'board' of images that you compile is then viewable by anyone else on pinterest, who in turn can save any of the images from your boards.",,,,,,

It's an ad machine right now, but because the algorithm seems to be broken the ads aren't even relevant. I am 26 / update irrelevant.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest used to be a great tool for exploring your interests. It seems like there's a new algorithm that restricts the home page and suggestions too much.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really wish the app would go back to the way it was when the categories you could search were front and center. I have greatly (90%) decreased my Pinterest usage over the last probably 4 years because the app is just shows an overkill of my most recent pins.

Also it makes it very inappropriate to use this app in public places.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE PINTEREST!!! It's an awesome service, both the site and the app are nice and intuitive and pretty easy to use. Love it. However there are some really annoying limitations to the app, and the website as well. First of all - sections! Really wish sections in pin boards were more versatile... Wish they were more like boards nested inside boards, also wish I could make just individual sections private/secret, rather than the whole board. Also, it'd very helpful if there was a ""more ideas"" link tab in them, like boards have, and I wish pins added in a section didn't affect ""more ideas"" for the full board. Also, bugs are pretty bad in the app - I have a section in a board, but when I try to save anything to that section, I don't see it, only the board shows up (without an arrow indicating there's a section inside, and letting me choose it); also, the ""organize"" button doesn't work properly when multiple pins are selected. And really, really wish there was a batch upload option to upload several images from system disk drive right in the app and website... But I have to use a 3rd party web service to do that. Finally, wish they didn't have that outrageous, disgusting ""sorry, you can't pin... to combat spam"" timeout block, really horrible! I'm not a spammer, I just add a lot of pins obsessively sometimes, TO MY OWN BOARDS, because I can't help it... People have incredible and really inspiring ideas, create really cool things! I mostly use pinterest to find awesome modern/futuristic architectural and vehicular design ideas that blow me away, amazing digital and great traditional art, sketching and drawing references and tutorials... So I can't help but add pins obsessively sometimes, BUT TO MY OWN BOARDS!!! I'M NOT DISTURBING/SPAMMING ANYONE ELSE! WHY BLOCK ME? Can Pinterest please not be so infuriatingly limiting?",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love pinning, when it actually works. There are issues/error messages often, and when I try to save an existing pin, the app freezes and eventually I get a msg stating something went wrong on Pinterests side. Also, when I try to create a board, an error msg states that board couldn't be created. When I went to send an error report through Pinterest, it freezes when I try to submit all the information, so I can't even alert Pinterest.

When I want to save or pin an image to a board I can only do one photo at a time. Most times I have multiple photos I want to pin at once but have go through one by one instead. Takes too much time. Like on Instagram I can select multiple photos to post. This should be the same.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Pinterest. I followed accounts that I was interested in, but now all I see are suggestions created by Pinterest's algorithm. I don't like the format of having to click on the 'following' tab to see that content, plus the way it's laid out in that tab is way less convenient to look through than the way the home page is laid out. Please bring back the Pinterest of 2015, even if it's just as a viewing option that users can choose. I almost never browse and pin new content anymore.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for years now. I get that apps need to finance themselves somehow but PLEASE show ads in a way that doesn't completely ruin the experience of the app. Also why has ""all pins"" been replaced by ""my shopping list""?

I'll probably stop using Pinterest altogether if the site keeps deteriorating.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. I sometimes spend hours saving pictures to my board that I can use as inspiration in life or my art practice. It is definitely addictive but also therapeutic. Only complaint is I sometime save the same photo twice and have to rummage through the section on a board to delete one copy. I've also noticed that some pins are noted as saved when they aren't and this could lead to lost ideas. But all in all great app.,,,,,,

Now most stuff doesn't even work properly anymore, for example, it randomly turns into ""dark mode"" without me changing anything. I miss being able to post multiple pictures ona one lost, why would you even remove that? My biggest issue is that now I'm not able to communicate with people, post things, share a board even with family all because I'm 14? You need to fix this.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can't even use the search bar.... it's terrible. It's good for photo ideas, but don't bother clicking into the links, they all had ads on ads on ads. Expect 3 ads on your screen when you click into a link or a ""pin"" that's not including the four pop ups, the one that redirects you. And so forth. So yeah it's ok.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not really liking the new update. There's a black fadeout on top of the images when I open it, so some of the details cannot be seen clearly. Even the back button on the upper left and the maximize button on the lower right seem to be more opaque than before. At least leave a gap on the upper part and make the buttons more transparent",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was very enjoyable for me to open the app and just scroll through while listening to some music, but now when I open it I get bombarded with ads and it's very distracting. It's not relaxing anymore. Tho the ads are somewhat related to what is being shown on my feed it's still very annoying since almost every pin now are ads. Please tone it down. I probably won't be opening the app again if this issue still persists.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like pinterest for ideas but there are a few features that need adjusted. The taskbar to switch search fields will disappear sometimes and the only way to get it back is to reopen the app. Also, after opening a pin's web page, pinterest will sometimes refresh before you had a chance to view other pins in that area that may interest you. Sometimes it will bump you from search results back to the home feed, which can be incredibly frustrating.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mostly ads. Bad algorithm. It keeps showing you the same pins, even pins youve already saved. The home feed tuner does not always work. i think that when you click on a pin to use the 'hide' function, it does not work because it also registers that you interacted with the pin and starts sending you related pins anyway. Ive seen some very triggering toxic diet culture/eating disorder pins showing up despite using the homefeed tuner and hide functions. I also miss being able to follow boards.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to find things from photography inspiration to my next meal. Sadly I've come to like it a little less due to them removing the search boards category instead of just pins/ users. I found it a easy way to find aesthetic photos of a kind in one board. But now I have to individually search through pins hoping the Creators have similar boards. Not bad, not fond on the ads though.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been a pinterest girl for many years and I have enjoyed the experience. Lately the layout change has been frustrating. It consists of shopping ads and the little information i do find to read up on takes me to broken links or blogs that have so many pop up ads that I end up googling what I need and screen shotting it and using less saving to pinterest boards. I get having to help your sponsor to keep the app going but its looking more like a mini search engine for shopping.,,,,,,

ONLY these square ads play with sound. All other ads and videos in my home feed autoplay WITHOUT sounds just as I would like. I emailed help, but they can't seem to understand what I'm talking about! It's like they don't even know their own product. Please fix this!",,,,,,

This has been a problem for several months. Additionally, you guys might want to add a report a bug feature like many other apps have so I dont have to resort to hoping you'll see my review, so here's two stars to give you incentive lol.

The first site I check when looking for anything relating to home maintenance, emergency prep, recipes, decorating, furniture, parties, kids crafts, quilting inspiration, travel, and so much more. Only drawback is that I find it addictive! Sometimes have to force myself to go 'do' whatever I was looking for info. on because I get sidetracked by so many other great ideas",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the idea of Pinterest in making a digital bulletin board of sorts. My biggest issue is that oftentimes the content that lies underneath the pins is stale, unuseful, or completely unrelated to the picture. I'm not sure there's an elegant way to solve for this but I have become much more fond of the tool recently as I build my own boards as opposed to using Pinterest as a visual search tool.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE Pinterest. The community is great, and you can literally search for anything you want in particular. It helps a lot when it comes to planning and visualizing for story ideas. Sometimes, I use it more of a fandom outlet too. However, I've had Pinterest for so long to where I grew accustomed to the categories. I would rate higher ONLY if Pinterest were to bring the categories back.",,,,,,

I don't know why this has been removed, but removing this feature may very well cause someone to die from an epileptic seizure.

Why is it not possible to see a full-screen image of the pins, without ugly and useless overlay buttons that merely repeat the options available in the main view? And why can't we scroll through sub-sections of boards? (you can on iphones). Please make a one-tap full-view/ swipe-away feature for viewing pins, and fix those other issues, and 5 stars it is! Enlargable gifs would be great too...",,,,,,

The pictures or videos that pop up when I want similar media to the ones I want aren't even similar nor even accurate. My personalization feed sucks too. Recently, I was having issues on why I couldn't rename my boards and I'm glad that got fixed though. But now, all my boards are made private without me even wanting it to be made private. Thank you so much for the app Pinterest, but I'm hoping these issues to be fixed and expectations to be met. üôÅ",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever you did the update to require camera permissions to create ANY new pin, regardless of whether you're uploading a photo or using a URL, was a mistake. I suggest rolling it back to when you had the option to create a pin from URL without requiring camera permissions. It just seems suspicious and I'm sick of toggling the permission off after I submit a pin. I never used the upload a photo feature anyway.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and the new story feature is awesome. I just have a one problem with the story pins.The problem is I can only post story pins for one time, when I try to post second time it keeps loading progress bar goes to halfway and stops completely. This is annoying because everytime I have to clear data and cache to post second time. Please fix this.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My overall experience is quite nice. But the only thing for which I'm not giving it a five star is that the texting/conversation part of pinterest is a little hard to comprehend. Like the messages always take time to reach and when I actually want to have a one-on-one conversation it's really difficult to know which message came after what and what message the person is replying to.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Adds are very repetitive. I hate their movie adds. They are so distracting. I keep coming back because pictures are a great way to share and save ideas. I love how you can organize boards and attach pics of things you have tried. That is so helpful when trying to decide if another pin is bogus or not.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I got on the app and it would only load 3 pictures in my feed and 4 of my boards. When I tried to reload it, it would say ""oops..."". I restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it still did the same thing so I left it. I checked again later; everything was loading except a few of my boards are missing. I can't pin anything onto them because they don't show up in my listed boards but if I go to my pins they have the pictures I pinned to the missing boards and I can access them.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've always loved the Pinterest app but now I'm kinda over it. For one, the algorithm is TOO sensitive. I look something up once or twice and suddenly my feed is flooded with that one thing. Also, videos/tiktoks are super glitchy. If I can get them to play at all, I can't rewatch them, it just shows the follow them button or whatever and glitches when I try to replay.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I normally love Pinterest but it has become unusable. When I am away from wifi nothing loads, pictures get stuck on the wheel forever. I have to constantly restart the app and then I lose the picture I wanted to view. If it's not that, it's a red banner telling me I'm not connected to the internet on the bottom of every single page. The app frequently crashes. I know for a fact there's nothing wrong with my phone. The only reason I still use the app is because I haven't found an alternative!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is great for organizing data, however, this app has been operational enough that they should have a method in place to save articles etc that do not have a picture. Many complaints have been made yet for some reason, they do not fix it and it is a easy fix. Also, when rearranging a board, you are rearranging for a different width under this function than the original board width is set, so it rearranges your board completely differently in the final mode than it shows when arranging.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate how the app automatically refreshes! If you leave the app to open another app for even a minute or two, then return hoping to look at a pin you were about to open, it disappears as the homepage automatically refreshes when you bring the app back up (even if the app wasn't shut down completely). It's infuriating and there's no way I can find to turn this feature off. Take a leave out of Instagram's 'New Posts' feature, and turn off the automatic refresh please!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Normally I'd give 5 stars because I love the app I use it daily. But I liked it WAYYY BETTER when scrolling through the home page when you could just hold a picture and 3 bubbles would pop up allowing you to save the picture without having to click on it to open it then save it. Having to push the back button to get back to the home page. Please bring it back or something similar:(,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to really love this app. My home feed for the last 6 months has been nothing but ads. I have no desire to open the this app anymore. A 100% ad free version that has a one time payment is absolutely necessary. I have had a pinterest account since the early days and have watched it get progressively worse and worse as the ad content becomes larger and more aggressive. Make an ad free version.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be amazing. Now they've changed it to where you can no longer swipe through pins infinitely. You get to a point after about 30 pins we're just stop scrolling and you can't get any more to appear.if you press the back arrow it will change which pins are on the page so if you want to go back and look at 1 unless you saved it the first time you saw it it's gone, because the page automatically refreshed half the pins. Really frustrating and enough to make me stop using it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Search is useless, just a bunch of ads. What happened to using Pinterest to search for inspiration? It's force feeding me videos (I would go to YouTube if I wanted that) and I can't even look for boards of anything specific. Impossible to look for anything, I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for a decade to explore people's boards for inspo and all of a sudden it is useless to me. Feels more like shopping on Amazon or scrolling thru Facebook. What a shame. Back to looking at magazines.",,,,,,

Most times I just quit trying to open anything of interest to me and hit the back button.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been increasingly frustrated by Pinterest: 1) because it used to be that if I was pinning to several different boards, those 3 boards would automatically stay up top, as my current top picks, but now, if a certain board title doesn't match the algorithm, it will disappear from my top picks as soon as I pin something to a different board.

Edited the review after major bugs were fixed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They did it. They finally did it. The newest update is so bad it's made the app unusable. Instead of fixing app-breaking bugs, Pinterest decided to ruin their own layout to make it impractical & an eye sore, got rid of the mass edit/delete/manage/move function so that you can no longer edit boards, the descriptions keep disappearing & it's been crashing ever since the update. I use this app for my job but I can no longer use it after this update. I don't know what I'm going to do.",,,,,,

I wish we could customize it to say ""no"" to certain things. I love history and like when religious stuff pops up in a historical context....but then I start getting bombed with Christian music/book/movie suggestions. Real turn off for a non-Christian.

I hope it doesn't descend any further into ads, but we all know that ultimately everything does.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love this app, but there are features I'd love to see that aren't there. mainly choosing which pin should be the 'thumbnail' for a board and its section. I'd like if the ""saved pin to X"" pop-ups wouldn't last nearly as long and also to have dark mode for the website and the computer app. I looked all over the settings and couldn't find a dark/light mode setting. besides that, it's great!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Totally addictive!!!! You can find anything everything!!!! I do think they need to make it to where you can open two diffent boards side by side and also two diffetent catagories within the same or different boards side by side. I think this would help with organization of pins and also reduce multiple saves of the same pin! But i love it use it for everything from crafts drawing painting decorating ides to lawn and garden ides organization building all the way to hair makeup clothes EVERYTHING!,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's an app that I've used since college. So I've seen a lot of updates in the last 12 or so years. But I'm not loving the newest update. The tiktok-like videos make it difficult to find a link, for creators like myself, to follow a simple how-to. I'm unable to find material lists or step-by-step guidelines. And those who want to read a recipe rather than watch the video...forget it. I'm hoping the Pteam will see this and revise or add a link to teach users to navigate the new features.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What is going on on y'all's end of things? I've used the pinterest app on phones and my tablet for years, and never had problems with it. Over the past couple of months, it's becoming more trouble than it's worth. Half the things I try to pin are an ""oops! There's something wrong with that!"" Well then why is it still on pinterest?? And what is up with all the freezing? So frustrating, especially when I'm trying to search for something. Stop killing your own app; make it awesome again. Please.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love how varied the pins are and how accurate the algorithm is, but what would be absolutely amazing is if you could set a pin to be the permanent cover for your board. Sometimes I'll save a funny pin to a board that I like, but then it becomes the new cover and takes away from the overall aesthetic of the page. I could just be missing that option, but it would be wonderful if I could set the aesthetic for my boards and change them occasionally instead of only saving certain pins.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sucky. I don't know what they did in their last update but there is a marked difference in the quality of the experience on this app. Literally ever 3 videos they place an ad & the search function seems to have stopped working properly as I not longer get nothing close to what I am hoping for. If Pinterest keeps this up I won't use it much, because it's a waste of time. It was a waste before, but now it's a pointless waste with no enjoyment factor.",,,,,,

This is a constant issue and over the years Pinterest has concerned themselves over ads and making buy able Pins opposed to a user friendly interface for users that have been around longer than retailers. I don't use this app the way I used to because of the way its run. Ridiculous.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I LOVE Pinterest. My favorite app ever. Ive turned into one of those annoying people that cant put there phone down because of it (well its not that bad but i never use to be attached to my phone before). I would give it 5 stars but recently it just wont load or constantly freezes and crashes. Plus if i try to pin a picture from my phone it wont load or if it does it gets pinned like 3-5 times and sometimes even in different boards. Please fix this and then I'd be happy to give it 5 stars.,,,,,,

Images take forever to load, videos won't play half the time, you can't rewind them at all, sometimes entire boards won't load, and trying to organize boards is a nightmare. I'll likely continue to use it, but I'm not really seeing any of these ""improvements"" that the updates speak of.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because I can see and search all the photos I like, of any kind and even create my own pins, which is absolutely fantastic. I don't give five stars for a very considerable reason : when I have to upload some pins, i can't upload them all together and due to this, it takes a lot of time and it's very stressful. Please, add the option of upload multiple pins at a time.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app has been of some help during our renovations: Pros: We could find designs we liked and could share them with others. The links to the suppliers were invaluable. Cons: Complicated to use and not particularly intuitive. The Pinterest links on the internet photos didn't always work. The app/website is busy and disorganised and searching in a logical way isn't easy. It is clunky to use - could be made slicker.,,,,,,

It says that I have a certain number of followers, but when I click on the ""followers"" button, it's completely empty. I can get a notification from my phone that someone saved my pin, but in the app, it says that I have no new notifications. I really hope this gets fixed soon because Pinterest is one of my favorite apps.",,,,,,

Pinterest Web doesn't work for me, it logs on and off and on and off to the point where its unusable. The app works perfectly fine, I am just sad they removed comments with pictures! It was fun to see how others recreated a painting or drew somebody from the pin or made a meal from a recipe idk it was cool and made Pinterest stand out from other social media!!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The top bar of the page doesn't work, always shows the today page. Every pin is covered by a back bar and the icons are on the picture instead of off the side, so you can't see the whole imagine, which is frustrating. I also wish there was a way to permanently turn off videos or music. It used to be a great app, but it's trying to follow a trend. I use Pinterest because it wasn't like Instagram and was simpler, but now I might as well just delete it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"An interesting, huge variety of different topics. Getting the hang of editing and organizing boards and pins, not that hard, I just get impatient. I think I've been able to find pins on everything. Sometimes though, if you show an interest in one subject, you get inundated. Need to keep more balanced. Finally figured out how to make and save pins. How to get them displayed, now that's a different matter. Love it. Great for a trivia nut like me.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is self-destructing. It used to be a great app, I loved using it for so many different things. But now, 80% of what you see is just ads, and most of them are irrelevant to what I'm searching. The number of ads over organic pins is driving people away in droves. Pinterest, if you want to keep your app alive, you better start significantly reducing the number of ads and promoting organic pins instead. Right now, your greed is showing, and it's very unbecoming.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is on top of the aesthetic game but, sadly, the only thing missing for me is an easier way to download the image without actually going to the single image interface.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using it for around 4 years now. The new update to the UI is really bad. It doesn't show me my notifications tab and i can't change my password through the mobile app. Everything nowadays is getting simplified and watered down. Honestly, i don't understand what some of these developers are even thinking. I might have to save my pins and delete my account. Goodbye, those were some nice 4 years... Remember, don't fix something that's not broken...",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really nice! I can pick any different styles and designs. I can also save images to the boards but my only concern is the 'Save', whenever I choose a image to my boards, I cant find the right one since I have so many.

Often when I go into the app it'll just stop allowing me to scroll or there will be no content, it just goes blank. I thought it was my phone but I got a new phone and it continues... I have to restart my phone in the middle of recipes which it quite inconvenient. I love Pinterest but this glitch is very frustrating!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest for the past 6-7 years and my only feedback is this: It would be great if you could bring the tabs back. It was easier to look into subsections while searching for something. Like when I searched for say, painting the tabs would show cartoons, portraits, city, still life and more little tabs underneath the search bar. It was really really great. Plz bring it back if possible.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app but there's a lot of bugs in it that need fixing. for example, notifications not working or not appearing, comments being turned off automatically on pins and not being able to turn them on, not being able to see comments people make on your pins besides in notifications, and the send button disappearing when you put an emoji in a comment (for reference I use an android 11 phone).

I get notifications about someone liking my comment or replying to it, then I check and there's nothing. Sometimes the notification badge is there but there's nothing 3- pins failing to be saved!",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please add a feature to pin multiple images at once from my phone storage. When pinning an image to a board I have to go to that exact folder to where the picture is and select it (which is fine). My only gripe is if I have 15 images to upload I have to go through this process 15 times. All in all the app is great and it gets more things right than it does wrong. My favorite feature would have to be the night mode/battery saver mode when Pinterest looks like it's dark themed.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It has been such a great app up until recently. There has been so many changes to the appearances, which I don't really mind it just kinda makes it little too hard to get use to because of how many times it gets changed. What I DO mind however is the bugs surrounding the boards and its irritating functions. I can only add 1000 pins to a section, and even if i do reach the limit, nothing happens! No changes to the numbers the section had originally. I tried readding but still nothing.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, it's a great app that allows me to browse cute images.

Hope this gets fixed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pinterest is now downstraight bad. I hate the quick save feature to be honest. I don't see the point of you guys actually thinking by putting this quick-save-to-profile feature would be a big convenience for the users. This feature just makes it complicated for us to save pins and messy at some point. It would be better if you guys remove this dumb feature.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to be amazing but just keeps getting worse and worse. I wish I could develop apps because I'd bring back the old one. All the freaking ads are ridiculous. Not to mention I have all kinds of things selected to see in my feed but I only see the last four things I clicked on OVER and OVER. You used to get all kinds of new and interesting things but now everything is in its own tabs so you get millions of the same thing. I hate it! I miss Pinterest. Sell outs...you should be ashamed!,,,,,,

Please fix this its really frustrating that I can't search for the pins I actually want to see",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was perfect over 5 years ago. Used to be easy to talk find and colab with other people. Now the UI is horrible and not user friendly. The buttons, like, and pin options don't even work on multiple phone types which were new btw. So you have to manually press like 4 or 5 buttons to save something when you should be able to just hold and add it. That's how it was before.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be good but now there is no everything page so unless you are looking for something specific it leaves you browsing the homescreen - which is highly repetitive (to say the least). They don't listen to requests to not show certain pins (Because I've seen them a couple of dozen times) and there is a lot of poorly disguised commercial content. Too bad, because Pinterest used to be fun to browse through. Edited down a star - the deluge of cheap/irrelevant paid ads is üëé",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All ads. I'd pay for an ad-free version because the ads truly ruin the experience. Looking at Pinterest on my phone, there are two columns of pins, with an occasional large ad that takes up both column widths. I just did a quick count and 6 out of 7 pins in a row on the right side were all ads. They're usually somewhat more dispersed, but I rarely get a full page scroll without an ad these days.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest used to be enjoyable but over the years, it's just disintegrated more and more into an unusable mess. Instead of being able to pick what board a pin is saved to like in the past, it now just gets sent to your profile as a ""quick save"" and there's extra steps you have to take to move it to the board you want it on.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pinterest is a interesting app to use from the rest. I really like the new content they build with the agrithom. Each time it brings me straight back in to new ideas. The only problems I have with app is that it gets confusing at times.

24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I love this app, I have one ongoing annoying issue: WHY is there not a mute function for the videos?? I don't want to turn them off completely, I just don't want to HEAR them. I want the ability to scroll through them and watch a few seconds and decide if it's something I want to actually hear. Most of the time it's some quirky music playing in the background and, let's be honest....I don't REALLY need to hear that in order to watch someone make paper roses. Right?",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE looking at Pintrest for ideas and USED to love how well it helped kept ideas organized but more and more often now, you click on a Pin and it plays the WRONG video, or the amount of videos that simply WON'T play on the app and the number of times the thumbnail doesn't even match the content that is searched for and played, is making the app unusable. And no, this isn't the creators falsely advertising videos, it takes 2 to 3 times restarting app and same video will finally play correctly.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest has gone downhill. Its appeal was that it wasn't sleazy like Facebook et al. Now it's just like all the others. We see a fraction of the content we choose, but 100% of the ads Pinterest wants us to see. I understand the need for ads. But it's gotten so pervasive that it's not worth it anymore. The last straw was the intrusive requirement for birthdays. I put a fake one in so that I could have access to retrieve pins I don't want to lose, and transfer them elsewhere. Buh bye....",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have used and loved Pinterest for a long time - both for content and mindless scrolling. Since the update a while ago to the floating bar instead of a permanent bar to take you to your personal page and click to search I've had more difficulties. The bar disappears and is not consistently recalled when I scroll to the top or reverse my scrolling. Seems like a bug? Happily 5 stars when they figure out this fix.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ok, as a Pinterest user from 2015, I still love this app to this day. Although I don't like some things where if I save one pin or search something up, my for you changes, but it's not that big of a deal since it changes back fast. I love making boards and saving pins, and creating pins is easy as well. The buttons are easy to navigate and overall this is my favorite app paired with Spotify of course!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd like to make a recommendation, the app fascinates me and is one of my favorites without a doubt but I think there is something that could help people who have slow devices or a slow or unstable Internet connection, besides saving data to those who use it using mobile data, it's simple: A new option to enable and disable the automatic playback of videos within the app and a very similar one that allows you to choose on what type of network you would like the automatic playback of videos. Thx",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't like that they got rid of the ""photo comment"" feature or the ""I tried this Pin!,"" feature. I get a lot of recipes off of pinterest, and now I can't see real pictures or examples of the recipe. To mitigate this, I downloaded a previous version of Pinterest. You can find the link to download the old pintetest on YouTube, forum boards, etc. Thank me later!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,They constantly update this app to become more like Instagram/Snapchat. I don't want stories from pinteresters!!!! I don't want a shopping section!!! I just want my standard feed with the option to add suggested pins to my boards.

I can search for accounts, and pins, but not boards. Will improve my review if this gets fixed. Edit: Why on Earth is there a black vignette on the top of every pin you select on mobile????? It ruins looking at art, or reference for art. You guys keep changing little things, and this app is getting worse. Edit: Everything saves to profile? Why?????? LET ME CHOOSE MY BOARD.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been uploading some spins and some of them showed that the comments were disabled which I don't remember I did.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest was my favorite app for many years but with this new update it's just getting hard to use and it's not even a pleasing experience anymore... The idea was to save pins in their respective boards but the update won't let you save the pin in that desired board, it automatically saves it on your profile. This is tedious since you can't keep your pins organized and if you want to save them in a board you just gotta make extra steps than before... It's just very uncomfortable now.",,,,,,

It is actually convenient.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"First of all, there's no search function to find your Pinterest boards you want to pin something on, instead you have to scroll through all of your boards to try and find the right one. I have hundreds of Pinterest boards, this is very time consuming. I don't use the Pinterest app that often just for this reason. Instead, Pinterest is better used on my laptop. Still, that doesn't get rid of my next problem, there are more ads than Pins, enough that it's really taking the fun out of the app.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app alot i have been using it for years but i would like to mention a few glitches and suggestions #1 sometimes clicking on a picture on the more like this page or on the homepage would play an ad or a video in the background that was next to the pin and sometimes music playing would pause clicking on a picture at random times. #2 i suggest adding a button that allows you to select mulitple to save pins from someone else's board or on the home page too. ‚ô°the app tho :),,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This has been a very helpful link for work. Some of the image viewers are weird. When navigating a post and its frustrating when i find gold and then the site requires a membership to even see it. I know its not pintrests fault but can be frustrating. Overall i enjoy the app and it helps me organize my hobbies and personal development.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this site, it can be accessed on a pc or in the app. Great to find ideas for craft projects, crochet, knitting, macrame, painting, drawing,etc. which is mainly what I use it for but there is so much more, just type in what your searching for and you are sure to find free patterns, advice, yoga poses, recipes, DIY, inspirational quotes, the list is endless!

Y'all don't need that so I can look for recipes and haircut ideas lmao. Especially if my Gmail is already attached, which also makes you add a birthday. App has just gone downhill over the years. Quality just isn't what it used to be. Searching for things doesn't even bring up what you're looking for half the time. Too riddled with Ads.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love pinterest. Now every pin is a link to spam or something that isn't what it was supposed to be. The newer version is horrible compared to how easy previous versions were when searching. The ""personalized"" home page now consists of ads, items that were already pinned, and suggestions that remind me of fb's 'people you may know'.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love pinterest itself but the ads are a nightmare. If you click on a pin that is not an ad but is situated near one on your screen, it will start the play the ad's music in the background. This is especially annoying because I often play music on my phone. About half of the time, the app will stop my music to play the music of an ad that I can't even see. The other half the ad's music is layered with my own and sounds absolutely awful. This situation is unavoidable when half of my feed is ads.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recommendation in ""all"" and some boards are getting annoying. I keep seeing BTS all the time when I always hide it because it was not relevant to me.

I have recently started organizing my largest boards into sub-categories since it's not convenient to scroll for a long time looking for a particular pin with 1k pins in a board. I am enjoying it. However, it would be appreciated if the process of moving pins from a board to its sub-categories be easier and faster. At least on mobile I have to scroll past all of the sub-categories. Slow process even when moving max number of pins.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the most useful website to ever exist and it's extremely easy to maneuver! I recommend to everyone; it literally has something for everyone be it moms, diy fanatics or amateurs, gardening, cooking, construction you name it! one function has been annoying me and it's the fact that you can't search for something omitting something. For example: crock pot soups without cream. Will literally give me recipes with cream. There's no way to word it where you get the results you want.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Search results are amazing and this is why I use it regardless of all its huge flaws. It's a hustle to save pins most of the time the save to pins when hold is gone so you have to click the image and save it there. Even if it's not gone it still ruins the experience. Like can they please just add a gesture like triple tap/click to save pins fast? Next is when someone deleted the board you followed. You don't get informed about it and you lose trace. Organizing is hectic when saved on ""Profile"".",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Look, I love pinterest. I think it's great. I've used it for years and it's very useful and enjoyable. But this new feature where everything gets saved to your profile is obnoxious. Why would I want to go back and sort through everything when I can just save it to the correct board right away? There should at least be an option to turn it off in the settings. Makes the experience a lot worse for me, which is sad since this is one of my favorite apps. :(",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's like pinterest gets worse with every update. Now the layout is weird and amateur looking. I've loved this app and have been using it for over 5 yrs but the videos and ads.... if they're gonna be plastered over everything give an option to mute the audio. it overpowers my music and interferes with other apps. I used to scroll on pinterest and have asmr playing in the back but now my ears get blasted by the loud ads and autoplay vids. Even when you turn off auto it still plays.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest, but I cannot continue to use the app if you guys don't get rid of the automatic ""Save to Profile."" At least make it like before, where you get to save your pins to specific boards, with added option of saving to profile. It's ruining the experience of the app because I have to take even more steps just to save something to my boards.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have not used Pinterest for a while and today I discovered the app now has video advertising which ruins the experience. Every time you scroll down there is a new ad which is not only distracting when browsing but is extremely annoying. I appreciate that apps have advertisements but there are just too many for an app like this as it ruins tge enjoyment. Such a shame. Needless to say I will no longer use Pinterest.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you change the thumbnail of the boards when you save something to just one picture like it was before. It feels overwhelming and messy to look for the board I want to save the pin when every board has a collage of the 3 latest saved pins, furthermore I've already gotten used to the color/shape whatever of the pin I set as the thumbnail so this recent update doesn't help at all.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pinterest I am so sick of the overwhelming amount of ads and promotional pins. I just want to scroll through normal pins without seeing two then having to scroll past 3 to 5 ads and repeat.

But now anytime I refresh the home page nothing shows up but a white screen and anytime I try to look at my boards it sometimes says ""you haven't saved any pins yet"" and I have to refresh the app (this happens quite often).

No rewinding recipe videos or anything of the sort, no restarting things to show my friend after I've watched it since they don't use the app, and no scrolling down to select what I watch next, forcing me onto whatever is next. So many functions are broken or uncomfortably awkward to use. At least give me the ability to turn off that method of scrolling. Not everyone likes mindlessly scrolling on TikTok.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the concept, needs some work though. Hate the fact that whenever I click on a pin I need to go through the cookie settings. Some pins don't actually contain what the picture/headline advertises and there are way too many ads. I'd love an improved ""more ideas"" function for my boards. Pinterest are doing a good job of warning about spam though, and the overall concept rocks! It's particularly helpful for recipes and gardening ideas.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm disappointed to say that I don't like the newer updates. Removing the ability to swipe from pin to pin on the home section was (In my opinion) a bad move, it takes longer now and I'm so used to simply swiping to the next pin that I forget that the feature isn't available any more and it frustrates me beyond belief, especially since my computer doesn't have this feature either.

It's pretty easy to navigate and I always find what I'm looking for when I search topics and I appreciate not getting too many duplicates of posts. I've been having issues lately with the app crashing on me after a few minutes, but I'm hoping it's just a bug that will soon be resolved. Overall I've had a great experience with this app!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I give it a three because the visual search in the bottom left of the picture is actually really annoying. I can't read/see what is under it.

It doesn't make it easier, nor was it a hindrance to those who don't use it. I'm glad that the ""idea pins"" don't take up the search every single time now, it's nice actually having just pins/one item. Uploading pins is simple and lovely, no complaints there.",,,,,,

I loved Pinterest and loved to be on it, but this app is just 50% ads now. And they've made it so it's almost impossible to swipe past them, you end up accidentally clicking them.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy Pinterest. It's really beneficial for project ideas.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to really enjoy pinterest. But now yall have included the feature where there are multiple pictures on one pin. Its really annoying.

Please revert back.,,,,,,

You are also not warned when pinning a duplicate image/link. I've contacted their help center at least twice over the last year with no resolution, it was just dropped. With this latest update you cannot see just the pins from those you follow, you must view Pinterest's home feed as they curate it for you. It is obvious this company's values have switched from the user to the shareholders",,,,,,

I have Very an Android note 10 and whenever I post a picture the button is missing for me to title it. Once I push edit I can see the line to add my comment but it quickly goes away. That is very important to me, can't remember everything all the times so notes are needed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest. It's great for saving recipes, ideas, anything really. Pinterest recently added a brilliant function where you can add sections to your boards. Would it be possible though to be able to add sections or folders to those sections??? So for example if I have a food board, I could then have a dinner section and within that dinner section I could have folder for all my chicken recipes, another folder for my mince recipes and so on. Apart from that, brilliant app. LOVE IT.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This review is a one because the latest update brought about the little video/clip feature. This feature has since boomed so much that when I look up things I used to I scroll through and its clips, clips, clips, normal, clips, clips, clips, clips, clips, clips, clips, so on so forth. I have to stick to my home page and hope I can find what I need there or I'm out of luck. This feature has caused nothing short of frustration and I'm considering deleting the app at this point.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible user experience. If I try to open any link from the web version it always opens the home page of the app instead of the list or item I was looking at.

I think the tune feed option could use some work.I think there should be a option to select what you specifically want to see rather than just selecting what you don't want to see.

This app has now become unusable compared to how it was a year ago.",,,,,,

It keeps on redirecting me to other websites and I need to go back every time to see other posts. People just re-post and re-post other's idea which is quite boring when the algorithm directs you to what you're interested, they just give you the same post in different styles. Lastly, the ads are annoying, they keep on appearing in every scroll. I'm going to delete the app!",,,,,,

I remember in the old version you could still view the same pin recommendations on ""more like this"" when you click on a picture, but in newest version, you could no longer view it because it was automatically refreshed (why???).

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so disappointed in the changes Pinterest has made to this app. Remember the quick pinning? Well, now you have to totally open a pin in order to pin it.

This has been an issue on my S7 and my Pixel. For months I've been dealing with random audio from videos (I can't even tell from what videos) randomly playing.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I can't believe I updated. Pinterest turned into a scroll of ads. It is absolutely disgusting that nearly every 3 pins is an ad.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Of course I love Pinterest. The A.I. used, however, impedes my ability to find what I'm looking for just as much as it helps. It's great at finding new content related to my interests. But, often prevents me from finding what I'm actually looking for. I miss the old days when searches actually brought up what I'm looking for vs bombarding me with interesting but largely unrelated content. It's this which forces me to reserve it's use for purely indulgent reasons, rather than integrating my biz.",,,,,,

CLAIMS of CGI is just that claims. The fact that the nose of the first aircraft clearly mashing right through the buildings coming out the other side without a chip off the paint was replaced with a more correct offering.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It's literally one of my favorites for sure. For some reason it keeps saying I need to update it and when I click on the button to try to update it, it takes me to Google Play Store & the only options it gives me is to either delete or open, there's no option to update. I guess I'm gonna try to delete and redownload or something, cuz idk what else to do. I can't even look at certain stuff, when i try to it says I need to update my app Not sure if it's a common problem",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New updates ruined Pinterest. The Pinterest TV ads play automatically and with sound. No way to mute without turning phone volume all the way down nor is there a way to hide from my stream. Whyyy??? Video pins that were added awhile back can't be rewinded or slowed, so following a recipe is a huge pain. Most do not include an ingredient list or link to text directions. Some video pins are low res screen grabs that are cropped. Blah!! So quality of pins are very poor. I uninstalled Pinterest. Sad",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is so inconsistent. It's very frustrating. It always pauses my music when I open an image. Why? Also 70% of the time, the search function will vanish and never return. The search bar is at the bottom of the screen. When you're scrolling, the search options will hide itself as to not obstruct the results. But it won't reappear when you scroll back up sometimes or even when you back out to the previous page. It's so inconsistent, limiting the apps usefulness when you need it in a pinch.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everyone can visit: (BrowserGood. Com) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, SECURE and FAST. I love Pinterest as it allows me to make aesthetics boards and find good pins. Though my only dislike about the app is the shape of the pins. Before they were square, sharp, aesthetically pleasing, and as a business account it did not show the pin stats unless clicked on. But now they're this weird, unpleasant round square-ish shape with no corners, visible with stats",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,idk what happened. I used to just keep scrolling for a while with endless pictures but now when scrolling the suggested images just end. also when I'm trying to look through all my boards alphabetically it'll just skip right back to where A starts. I can't even look at all my pins (like S or T) without it freaking out and scrolling back up to A. annoying.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my saving grace during lockdown, but the utterly pointless and stupid decision to remove the search filter has made the app pretty useless to me! Besides that rather major problem it freezes, it randomly refreshes your search and home pages resulting in lost pictures and ideas, you can't pin something more than once, & sometimes you just can't pin something at all! The ads are also overwhelming and needlessly noisy",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of these updates are completely useless and annoying. What's the point of getting rid of the user profile on the bottom right? I have multiple accounts, the profile picture would tell me instantly what account I was on. They've been making completely pointless and useless updates in these past few years.. also why can't I browse through my unorganized pins? Now I have to forceful place them in a board to see them properly. Ugh these useless updates",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app, now AI deleting innocent pins are ruining the app. So many people are having their boards ruined because innocent pins are getting flagged. Some users get banned for it. Every single day, I get emails about how my saved pins are taken down, and they give a link for me to view said pin, and the link never works (it expires in 7 days but it still doesn't work before that). I've used this app for 7 years and I can safely say you're ruining this app beyond repair.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very great app! I can save every picture i like! And if some people say that the adds are irritable well,not for me. I don't know why is there no add popping out of my screen, which is good. And its not laggy, the pictures are high quality. So I don't seem to see no problems. Keep up the good work!üíú",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I rated this 3 stars because of the search bar being gone, I was surprised to find out that it waa gone.. now when I want to pin an image to a specific board I have to go all way down and do it manually instead of typing the name like it used to be, I hope the search options would ne back soon, it made things way easier.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My go to for exploring all topics under the sun-- its tendency to have synapses of link articles makes it easier to find relevant information than a regular search engine. It's also perfect for compiling visual information. The inspiration never stops when you do a pinterest search. It's more inspiration than you can ever use! Pinterest is Amazing.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love pinterest and now I rarely use it because of all the adds. I hate the automatic, loud playing videos that I can't seem to mute. I liked seeing pins my friends pinned in my feed. I wish you would bring back the feature at the top for narrowing down the subject you are looking for. Now it's just the circles like Instagram and Facebook stories. Please bring back some old features....",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great , But sometimes it brings ads unrelated to the search, which is really annoying. Also, the main feed often does not match the photos and topics I follow. But anyway I enjoy this app",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love Pinterest... Honestly an amazing life saving app but I updated it and all of a sudden I lost the ability to search for boards... Usually you search something and then can choose the 'boards' option but that is now gone so I had to download an older version of the app and the problems gone... But that update really messed up,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Short form content is broken. It is ruining Pinterest. I don't want to see videos playing on my feed. I hate it!!! Pinterest wasn't made for this. It was made to share creative ideas through ""Photos/Images"" The 'more like this' feature is much much worse now, the older version really showed the pins related to the one in the above pin; this new one just shows almost completely different pins. For these reasons I'm down rating the app from 5 to 3 stars.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely hate the new changes on the app! It's confusing to my eyes to have to look at my boards side by side with the photos showing. It's much easier to just look at a list of titles when I am looking at my own boards. I don't understand why you have taken this option away, but I will not be able to use it as much if this option is not restored. I used to love pinterest, but with each new update it's getting less and less fun and more and more difficult to use.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Over time this app has become my go-to for saving ideas and recipes. The biggest disappointment is that the ads are taking over the feed. Every time I Iogon it's worse no matter how many times I hide an ad. Definitely takes much of the enjoyment out of browsing when very little of my actual interests show up anymore.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"pinterest was one of my favourite apps as to how my fyp matched my interests so well and i could scroll through the contents provided in order to have comfort. but recently i noticed all my followers erased, search results being inaccurate and also not being able to check the second slide of 2 slided posts. it's difficult to find proper pictures if this happens.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Takes forever to load pins, if they do load. I keep finding the end. Refreshes when you scroll back up or go back to the home page. Sooooo many ads. Do Ikea and Etsy own Pinterest now? GIFs/videos don't play, even after clicking on them. But don't worry, the video ads do! Can't stop the notifications of when someone pins a pin that you did.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I use it everyday, it's very calming it's like media but without the social part. Probably the 3 only things that would improve the app in my opinion would be for 1 :you could change the cover of your board on android. 2: I really want to be able to change the color of the background kinda like tumblr. üò≠ 3: if you could get recommendations for people to follow. But other than that, I love pinterest <33",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, but this new update is so incredibly inconvenient. I don't go onto Pinterest to watch videos. I go there to save pictures. I don't appreciate the watch thing instead of being able to swipe between boards to save. Would love if you could turn it on/off to back to the original or it just be removed.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love it! I've been using it for years and it is my most used app. I feel more creative, up to date and motivated to do things. It is for sure an app for everyone. It is so diverse and definitely not just a girly app. They have fitness, food, books, memes/funny things, room and craft ideas, men and womans clothing and even gift ideas. Also, to find things again you can stay organized by creating a board and even a section in your board. Infinity/10 would recommend to a friend! üòÇ",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would have given this app a full star... But there is one thing in this app which I find very annoying.

Hard to enjoy or focus because ads are flashing, blinking or moving (even tricking you; when you tap on something thinkin it was not part of your subject matter, it was an ad). I make a game out of it, I try to X out as many ads as possible while scrolling! Otherwise I use a search engine to find subject matter to avoid ads. I use pinterest much less now due to ads.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to adore Pinterest and have used it since it was invite only. The last few years it's really gone downhill. Literally every other pin is an ad now and it greatly takes away from the user experience. You used to be able to use Pinterest for inspiration on topics that you actually had an interest in but now you're just bombarded by what's trending. I wouldn't mind paying for this app if they got rid of the ads and returned to the old ui but at this point I'll be looking for a replacement,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using it from 3 years and so .... but from past 2 weeks when I open the app it just keeps downloading and doesn't show any feed on the home tab ... so uninstalled the app and re installed it but when I keep my email ID and password it is showing that something went wrong and I can't log in .. pls fix this problem as soon as possible,,,,,,

I also can't even save pins anymore, and your app has a consistent problem with DELETING my boards that had completely appropriate content, it's aggravating, fix this now.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am trying to read some good info but I can't because of the unbelievable amount of ads in each page!!.I am trying to scroll down but I accidentally hit an add then it takes me there. It is a hussel to read something on pintrest. Every time I close the app and quit using it because of adds üòë. You are losing potential real buyers because of your annoying way in showing ads.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest and I've been using it since 2014, but I still think the website is better than the app. I would suggest giving is the ability to quick search a board by typing like on desktop. I have over 100 boards so this would be super useful. Also, if we could disable comments/tries in settings that would be nice. I like how they're hidden on desktop, but I would like to be able to turn them off completely. Still love the app and will continue using it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Pinterest! I've learned (and eaten) so many things out forward by others.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Interface is awesome, I love the features. One thing I would enjoy for the next updates or however many updates is maybe a more advanced search within the inbox, maybe like a comment history or something so it is easier to navigate, oh another thing to mention.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Use to love this app. But they removed the option to scroll through pinned pictures. I mean, c'mon. This is the touch screen age. If we need to click/tap on each picture to view it, that was sooooo yesterday. You had a great thing goin'. Why'd you change it.... for the worst. Bring back the intuitive design you had. Pin a pic - tap on the board - tap a pic and swipe till' our eyes fall off. That's how we like it, and that's how your app will be loved.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has really gone downhill. It used to be good, but now you cannot see other users' boards and can't find anything because 50% of results are ads.

It feels less innovative and honestly quite dull. Other things could be focused on other than changing what those of us using the app are so used to and PREFER. The new way to save a pin is blocky, and I ended up coming here to comment rather than save a pin. Give us the circle menu back, please. It was so cool and unique! Don't fix what's not broken.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love Pinterest but I wish they'd bring back the topics like they used to have. I loved being able to see what was popular on Pinterest rather than just see my own feed and be able to look at categories if I didn't know what I wanted to search for. Now I find that when I search for certain things I find the same pins almost every time. I would really love it if the categories of the explore page would come back. My other issue is that the photo search function icon blocks a large amount of the pins when looking at them. If there is anything in that bottom right corner I struggle to see it because this function is in the way. Please please please can we bring back the categories and and move the icon for the photo search so posts can be seen easily. Otherwise I've loved Pinterest from day 1 and I really recommend,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is very good at recommending content relavent to you. One of my favorite apps. I waste alot of time on it. Great for fandoms. Sometimes it has its moments, but bugs are usually fixed quickly. One of my only complaints is that when you return to the home page it reloads. Which to me is a little annoying because I'll see a pin i like and want to save but usually before i can tap it the page refreshes and its gone :\ but thats pretty much the only complaint. Would definately recommend!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app in general but it does an auto refresh for the home page everytime I switch tabs(as in try to search something of go to settings).

Also I wish there were still board recommendations from other users. These are just things i noticed but it is a really good app in general.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So. Many. Ads. I get that its part of their business model, but this is just utterly ridiculous. It seems like a quarter or more of my stream is now advertisements, and most of them don't even match my interests.

Can't wait for an alternative program to pop up so I can bail.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Previously loved Pinterest and was on it regularly. As so many others have commented, the latest update does not improve the app and I no longer enjoy using it. For example, it is impossible to order the pins on a board properly due to a changed layout when you're on that screen which is different from the usual view. If I can have the last version back I'll be happy. Is this possible?",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update the app is seriously buggy on my Note 8. It often can't find my pins and then I have to close out the app and restart my phone. If I leave the app open while I look at another app or answer my phone, when I return the app goes back to the main page and what I was reading is gone. It has become much slower and doesn't seem to search my pins very well any more. This latest update has been the complete opposite of an improvement.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great if you're just looking for photos, terrible if you want to read an article. Trying to read an article through the app is unbearable. The pages are full of ads and only downloads about half the article. If I want to read the full thing I have to copy the link and open it in Chrome. It's aggravating and makes me avoid using the app.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app, but today it started flashing a highlight circle over the send button. I assumed this was temporary. Not so. Every image I look at, the circle just keeps on flashing. The app, for me, is now unusable because the flashing circle over the send button is so distracting. What genius at Pinterest thought this was a good idea?",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I used to love Pinterest however the new update is ridiculous! Its so much more difficult to save pins now! Why would the developers change the most user friendly function of Pinterest? We used to be able to hold our finger on any pin and pin it to a board now you have to open the pin and save it. Its just time wasting. Bring back the old click/hold function or at least make it a setting in the app where you can choose to use it or not. I don't understand why it was taken down in the first place,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have used pinterest for years and have always loved it for creating mood boards, house DIY and recipe ideas. Lately with every new update its getting worse&worse....more and more ads, most pins are being replaced with multiple short stories so are useless to add to a board when the picture I was saving is gone in a few seconds, and this new feature of automatically adding a pin to my ""profile"" is pointless when I have to go back and add it to the correct board afterwards. Just getting worse :(",,,,,,

I don't know people planned weddings before Pinterest!",,,,,,

I give my email, age, birth date, country, then it goes to selecting what you're interested in. Blank page again. This kind of stuff happens CONSTANTLY. I'm really upset. It's frustrating and there's nothing I can do to change it.",,,,,,

Since I care I would like to give some critiques; the red pop-ups take too much time to go away, on phone you can't search for the board u wanna save the pin to, the feature of searching for boards was super useful, as well as the one to see the following of others. Idk why the last two were removed. I really like the note feature, would like to see other improvements to the organization board system+I would like to bulk download a board",,,,,,

Stop fricking taking away the ability to reorder things, it's a pain in the ass every goddamn time.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love pintrest and will recommend it to anybody but recently they have started putting ads on my homepage that auto play with sound. I dont mind ads but theres no need to disturb the peace and quiet that my homepage use to give me. It such an annoyance and its hard to overlook. Also they don't have a function where you can mute a video's sound but keep the video playing. Some videos don't even have a mute button.It's the little things that make me want to stop scrolling and clicking on videos.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is really easy and fun to use, however, someof the problems I have experienced are 1) when you search something (for example vegan bread) the search doesn't filter out non-vegan options soyou have to sift through the entire recipe to make sure it is what you want. 2) when viewing the app on your phone it be glitchy and also pages won't load well or save to your Pinterest boards well. 3) this is not a Pinterest thing but beware of websites that have viruses.",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Newest update does not easily allow user to access content of pin. It only allows user to find similar items for sale instead of reading (or watching) content of pin. Update 6/4/21: feed has not refreshed in about 12 hours. And there is no update scheduled. And I don't like some of the posts where sound auto plays. Should be my choice to play sound.,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is easily my favorite app in the world. It's like Google Images with way better images and Instagram without needless extra features and other people. It's really peaceful to use and it serves its function excellently. I almost always find what I'm looking for (provided i search with the correct words) and it adjusts my feed according to what I actually like. 100% recommend especially if you're some sort of visual artist (like me haha),,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is getting more and more irritating with different changes. My biggest complaints are these: ~Magnifying glass in the bottom right corner is in the way more than it helps ~Too many ads ~Sound plays from pins that I'm not looking at. A lot of times from ads ~Menu/search bar disappears and often doesn't reappear. I've had to close the app and reopen it to get it to show up again multiple times ~The auto refresh is kinda annoying ~What do the comments even do?,,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Spam, spam and more spam. Things started out OK, but after a few months literally every gif or informative link would redirect to spam. It's clickbait heaven. My feeds would not have many pins relevant to the main subject matter either, I'll search for wood cabins and get flooded with 6pack abs pins. The interface is not easy to use, it doesn't pop up all the time and its not straight forward to find stuff I've saved. I just screenshot stuff now and look at the pins in my phone gallery.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would absolutely love it there was a search board option while I save pins because it's hard to search the board I want between so many other boards!! ,also my camera option isn't really working properly, nothing really shows up when I click on the gallery option and also adding a add pin option directly on all pins would be really great! I absolutely hate the new update ugh, I loved the feature where I could just save pins from the board I recently saved pins to ,it was just so much easier!",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is practically useless these days. AT LEAST half of any search results are ads, and worse, at least half of those ads have absolutely nothing to do with what was searched for.

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Further changes made the last changes even WORSE. ""quicksave"" or ""profile"" boards that are completely unnecessary and forced upon users, requiring us to then move the pin to its appropriate board. The removal of ""see all"" boards option with ""create new board"" from a list of suggestions. I have to look at the suggestions before I can see my existing boards. This is awful. Additionally, the creation of a board for a shopping list was NOT something I ever wanted. Give me the option to remove it.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Holding a pin that shows 'add pin to board/share/etc' is gone, which makes adding pin to boards even more difficult. The home feed recommends things I don't have interest in, like watches, food, etc. AND there used to be a suggestions tab on home feed where you can add similar pins to your board much more easily. Sucks that such an app downgraded like this, like such other apps.",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy Pinterest because I build cars as a hobby, so it allows me to collect all these different images to call apon later for reference! Then it's easy to get carried away with Pinterest and start making up folders of all your different interests.

Pinterest is definitely one of my favorite apps!",,,,,,

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love pinterest but a few features can be a bit disruptive.

24-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: The app is still as scuffed as ever, but somehow worse. I can't even make a public board anymore nor can I un-secret already made boards. It's like it's not even an option; you have to have secret boards. I'm really starting to get extremely frustrated with the app itself and the fact the developers haven't even looked into this issue.

24-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun app, pretty easy and intuitive *except* the image discovery low-key sucks. If a page has a gallery with multiple images, the app only detects the first image. Exception is if you navigate to the site from an existing pin and find the page you want, then the app miraculously detects all gallery images. This means it's possible to detect the gallery images, but one of the developers messed up... and this janky image scraper still made it through QA testing. Boooo",,,,,,
24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has a wonderful concept. There are many downfalls to this app however. Every ""post"" is actually a link or advertisement to another site.

My only issues are that my home page's pins aren't really tailored to my interests as much as I'd expect them to be and there is a lack of diversity in the pins shown to me (majority of the women shown in fashion pins are white - very rarely do I see anyone else).

24-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is constantly getting worse and worse updates, and it has recently become upsest with deleting every pin that shows even a hint of skin or blood. One of the pins it deactivated for ""sexuality"" is just a picture of two FULLY clothed people cuddling. The worst part is, even if you've just saved these pins, not posted them, just saved them to a board, YOU get punished by a possible suspension. That's like getting punished for having a demonitized YouTube video in your YouTube playlist.",,,,,,
