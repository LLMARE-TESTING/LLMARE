2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"really good app,been using it for a while. The reason I give it three stars is because the ""audio not available in your location"" really sets me off. Not only that but sometimes when I open certain videos it'll just be a blank black screen with the audio sound playing. I don't know if this is a bug, but if is, then I really wish for it to be fixed because even older saved videos of mine do this which is very confusing considering I've viewed it before",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Pinterest from the early 2010s. It is a very good app back then, in fact, I've been giving it 5 stars rate. However, the recent updates rendered it down the drain. Now, after downloading an image, a sudden pop up would appear and sometimes, it caught me off surprise and when tou are using a phone while doing that, you would wrongly clicking on the list of contact. I've been sending a ton of wrong message from that and the suckest thing is you can't even delete the message. Fix it",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is one the best social media platforms Ive used. The concept and idea is good and it has been done well for the time that I have it. However, Pinterest is always getting new updates that are not necessary. First of all, we can't upload pictures to the comments. Second of all, it glitches A LOT lately. for a example, a pin can be normal and then it will have lines on top of it, other pins will take it's place, some of the pins disappear and just turn black. I hope it gets improved",,,

This is a jarring, unwelcome change. ‚≠?- for the menu change ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠?- because I still love the app. Edit: I wish users were allowed to use previous versions.

Firstly, when it deletes my pins and I have to copy the link in my email to see a blurry version.. the images can be as simple as two people hugging and it deleted my pin?? What? Secondly, you can't download videos only photos. Thirdly, I think you should have sections within sections of boards. Overall love the app just think it could be better.",,,

2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worse and worse. This app updates constantly, but fixes nothing. Blocking someone does nothing. It's completely useless, there is no way to stop seeing things you can't stand. Almost half my feed is spam, most of the rest is ads, including sometimes out of nowhere a big one with sound, usually very loud, which is disruptive and painful (when wearing headphones). The ads aren't personalized, and are usually videos, which really clutters up your feed, making it hard to see the actual pins.",,,

Surely that isn't too much to ask. The audio not being available in my location is also quite annoying. I had a fair amount of videos saved and suddeny I can't listen to the audio anymore. On top of that pictures in comments are now the size of a thumbnail, which makes it impossible to see what's written. Ads are also getting unbearable",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is nearly a perfect app, but it has one single unavoidable and annoying problem. The problem is that the app always shows a pop-up of contacts after downloading an image, and you end up sending an image to a contact or a profile that you follow by mistake. It is very annoying. I'm sure that if anyone wants to send an image to someone else, they can do it manually. Please get rid of the pop-up. Other than that, the app is a joy to spend time one.",,,

Just one thing tho, before the recent updates when downloading pins, the small icon at the top would drop down to show that a pin was downloaded. Now in the new updated version when a pin is downloaded, the option to share the pin pops up and takes up the entire screen and sometimes accidentally send the pin to someone(which can't be undone, another problem) I personally think it's such a bother and reallyunnecessary for the 'share' popup pop up after downloading every pin",,,

2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I think I'm just going to go through and delete most or all of my pins. The frequency in which pins get removed or disabled for bogus reasons is absurd. Someone creates a website and then gets mad if their content is shared? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a website? Pinterest is a glorified scrap/recipe book. But there are rules on what we can save? Stop being so sensitive. Or maybe fix the algorithms so the crybabies only see pictures of beige color swatches or plain white t-shirts.,,,

In fact I've noticed they interfere and affect the loading process when I open up the app or when it reaches a certain point (like one page down) and I have to reload again. I've also noticed that whenever I save a pin the app tends to double pin (or triple pin) a post to a folder. It happens a lot and I then have to manually delete one of error pins.,,,

You can clear up what you don't want to see, but when you reload the page you just get a load of things you never showed interest in (minion memes, German quizzes, etc).

Not to mention how annoying it is to click on a pin in your home page, save it, and have the whole page refresh. Pinterest went way down hill in a short amount of time and it's really frustrating!

The sort function can be a pain to resort pinned images. The constant ads, especially the video ads are annoying. I have to repeatedly turn the sound off manual for each one.

I liked the app fine, but it got worse only because the visual search button covers the bottom of the images. I don't always want to click on the image to go to the page, because the image could be buried in the page and I don't feel like hunting. But now I can't see part of the image.

Also the explore function helped me to find things I am interested in in categories I haven't known about before. Basically after they removed that function pinterest now became useless to me.

The usual ratio is somewhere around 11:1 at this point. On top of that, whenever you click on a pin and then go back, it scrolls you a random amount back up the page.

2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's block ads and very fast.

This is the first time I was able to find my saved collection's. It would be nice if that was made easier. No sense having recipes if you can't find out how to get to them,,,

You can check things off as you do it, it would prompt you to save, move or delete that pin after checking it off. Also, it could ask what your thought of the pin afterwards. I make recipes all the time and never review them because I just don't think about it, this would make you think about it.",,,

First of all the app plays ad audio when the ad isn't visible making for very loud surprises sometimes.

Another thing I don't like is that in the bottom right hand corner of every pin is a shaded icon which makes reading certain pins impossible. If that could be removed, that would be wonderful.",,,

I'm visual so the images on pinterest are great, but bra/lingerie & vacation shopping, not so much. So disappointing, it was once my all time favorite app.",,,

It can also inspire you to create new drawings.

2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest worked perfectly fine until about three updates ago. The comments are being stupid, to the point where things will get repeated , or it will say there's a comment or reply and not show it. Every time I try to comment something, it crashes. Also, when I have a board, it no longer suggests things even barely related to what is actually in it. The slide-show thing for the videos is really annoying, when the entire thing is done, you cannot re-watch no matter what you do.",,,

However there are some really annoying limitations to the app, and the website as well. First of all - sections! Really wish sections in pin boards were more versatile... Wish they were more like boards nested inside boards, also wish I could make just individual sections private/secret, rather than the whole board. Also, it'd very helpful if there was a ""more ideas"" link tab in them, like boards have, and I wish pins added in a section didn't affect ""more ideas"" for the full board. Also, bugs are pretty bad in the app - I have a section in a board, but when I try to save anything to that section, I don't see it, only the board shows up (without an arrow indicating there's a section inside, and letting me choose it); also, the ""organize"" button doesn't work properly when multiple pins are selected. And really, really wish there was a batch upload option to upload several images from system disk drive right in the app and website... But I have to use a 3rd party web service to do that. Finally, wish they didn't have that outrageous, disgusting ""sorry, you can't pin... to combat spam"" timeout block, really horrible! I'm not a spammer, I just add a lot of pins obsessively sometimes, TO MY OWN BOARDS, because I can't help it... People have incredible and really inspiring ideas, create really cool things!

Before, when you selected to save a pin, your boards would appear in name, with a cover photo of one of the first images in the board. I could just know what colour the board I wanted was and didn't have to think about it. That's not the case now, it's a collage of recent additions to the board. Just makes it more annoying to use.

All in all it's so disappointing since I didn't experience these problems before. They could've done better than this sht,,,

2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest used to be enjoyable but over the years, it's just disintegrated more and more into an unusable mess. Instead of being able to pick what board a pin is saved to like in the past, it now just gets sent to your profile as a ""quick save"" and there's extra steps you have to take to move it to the board you want it on. Moving and organizing pins is also ridiculously glitchy, i transferred several pins from an old account i had and 80% of them somehow deleted themselves 30 minutes later.",,,

Each time it brings me straight back in to new ideas. The only problems I have with app is that it gets confusing at times. Like when I save a picture it took me a long time to realize and looking for the browser website took long time. The visual search should have more features like the new google lens.

They have deactivated my account and the only way to get it reactivated is to share a copy of my birth certificate. Insane! App deleted!"
2024/3/24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i loved this app before the latest update. it had comments (which were great to communicate with other people) a feature in which you could swipe to switch between pins, and a Tried It section. I think they should not have removed these great features, and with them, the experience would have been a lot better.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible user experience. If I try to open any link from the web version it always opens the home page of the app instead of the list or item I was looking at. When browsing a list, horizontal swipes between items stops working the moment one item loads completely. Then you are locked to only vertically scroll that item or else press back and click on another one. Very poor app.",,,

2024/3/24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm a pinterest addict. It used to be a 5, but its lost a star because for whatever reason, when using the pinterest browser after clicking a link it's almost impossible to click any links or buttons, or x's on the site you're on. This is true w multiple android phones. It's very frustrating. I don't want to open it in chrome just to scroll to where I was and click a link.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I hate that sometimes when I'm on Pinterest music starts playing randomly, and even when you click onto different images it still keeps playing. In my opinion Pinterest should be silent! Or at least go away when you're viewing different images. Or have a mute option! Otherwise it's your typical little image viewing app but pretty much anonymous. Wouldn't call it social.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like using Pinterest and having been doing it for a long time. I think the tune feed option could use some work.I think there should be a option to select what you specifically want to see rather than just selecting what you don't want to see. Also, recently a lot of images have been popping up and pretending to be a video with a fake play icon. If you click them to play the video it will lead you to another website. Please do something about these.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you want to look at ads, this app is for you. Unfortunately, over the past few months, my Pinterest feed has gotten only worse and worse, to the point of being barely usable. Just yesterday, my feed was 95% unrelated content. I keep seeing images of cars, Roblox, and interior design, despite never showing interest in those things. I decided to just download a lot of my pins and uninstall the app. I'm very disappointed.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is a pretty good app considering the content inside, but i really would prefer if they just added a 'download video' to many videos since you could not download videos from pinterest, in which it makes it really hard for me to go to the website to screen record from there. so i would very much appreciate if you would add a download video button. thank you.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pinterest is my favorite app of all time. I have been using this app for years. But recently I am having some problem. It doesn't work at all. The home page is always loaded. I thought there might be some problem with my device. So uninstall the app. Now when I reinstall it and try to login, it won't let me in. It's the only app I can't live a day without. It is a part of my daily life. I didn't expect such bugs from such an app I really hope you resolve this issue as soon as possible.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have loved this app for 7 years, but in the last few months the amount of adverts has become ridiculous. Of the first 10 tiles when it loads, 7 are adverts, and as I scroll down over 50% of every pages is advertising, the adverts don't relate to anything I am interested in, and many feature videos which automatically play which wastes so much data. This app has now become unusable compared to how it was a year ago.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfriendly and way too many ads I've been using this app for a few years.... And it is getting annoying these days. It keeps on redirecting me to other websites and I need to go back every time to see other posts. People just re-post and re-post other's idea which is quite boring when the algorithm directs you to what you're interested, they just give you the same post in different styles. Lastly, the ads are annoying, they keep on appearing in every scroll. I'm going to delete the app!",,,

2024/3/24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! It allows you to get loads of inspiration for anything you could think of. The feature which allows you to search for similar images is super handy because you get fill a whole folder of things with the same vibe, giving you more invitation and pushing your creativity.

I constantly get waves of pins that are completely unrelated to what i want, which is just one thing (sims 4 cc). No matter how much I tell this dumb app that I dont want the random things it suggests to me, it keeps showing it to me anyway. I don't know whether it's trying to recommend things based on whatever i do on other apps, or if the ""dont recommend"" button just doesnt work, but its frustrating. Im this close to not using it anymore.",,,

I'm giving it a 3 because Pinterest itself won't let food creators provide method or link with the recipe shorts that will take us to their recipe, or their blog.

The only two complaints I have is sometimes I pin something random that I usually would not have been interested in, and then my feed will blow up with similar pins because of the single one, it can be annoying. I want to see stuff that I pin regularly or things I've pinned regularly in the past. Second complaint is the organizing option for moving pins around to different folders is VERY time consuming.

Unlike getting rid of the ability to search for boards, both in the search tab while searching (it at least still shows People, which is something I've never used but at least that isn't also useless now) and with the button that used to be beside the search bar after searching.

2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"First of all, the newest update sucks. I remember in the old version you could still view the same pin recommendations on ""more like this"" when you click on a picture, but in newest version, you could no longer view it because it was automatically refreshed (why???).

Also I dont care who saves my pins if I didn't make them please don't notify me every second, I also once got scammed by an ad shown on the app. Otherwise I am thankful for its existence and I spend many hours on it.",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be good, but right now it's unusable and annoying, whenever I open a pin it automatically starts a video-ad with audio turned on. since I usually use my phone to listen to music it interrupts the music so that I have to hit the play button again every time. No chance of using it comfortably that way. If at least the audio were off by default, the videos wouldn't be as intrusive as they are. Big thumbs down",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so disappointed in the changes Pinterest has made to this app. Remember the quick pinning? Well, now you have to totally open a pin in order to pin it.

2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been a hardcore Pinner for years now (since 2015) HOWEVER I'm posting this in hopes something gets fixed. The video player is severely broken. This has been an issue on my S7 and my Pixel. For months I've been dealing with random audio from videos (I can't even tell from what videos) randomly playing. Sometimes it's from the last page I was on and carries over to a new page. Just now it sounded like 3-5 videos were all playing at the same time. Its turning this app into a nightmare tbh.,,,

2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I can't believe I updated. Pinterest turned into a scroll of ads. It is absolutely disgusting that nearly every 3 pins is an ad.

2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I used to love Pinterest however the new update is ridiculous! Its so much more difficult to save pins now! Why would the developers change the most user friendly function of Pinterest? We used to be able to hold our finger on any pin and pin it to a board now you have to open the pin and save it. Its just time wasting. Bring back the old click/hold function or at least make it a setting in the app where you can choose to use it or not. I don't understand why it was taken down in the first place,,,

Lately with every new update its getting worse&worse....more and more ads, most pins are being replaced with multiple short stories so are useless to add to a board when the picture I was saving is gone in a few seconds, and this new feature of automatically adding a pin to my ""profile"" is pointless when I have to go back and add it to the correct board afterwards.

2024/3/24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's really frustrating that when you pin something you want to keep and you go back to your search results, it takes you all the way to the top and you have to scroll all the way down to pick up where you left off before you pinned it. also I know to be free you need ads but there are more pop ups and interruptions in Pinterest then ever before I've literally backed out of the app and go to Google and YouTube because I couldn't get through one pin without being interrupted multiple times",,,
2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Conceptually a great idea, needs some updates.. For example, no way to pay to get rid of ads or to turn them off, the ads that are videos dont always have a way to stop their audio even after leaving the ad and more often than not they repeat until the app is closed and reopened, at which point youve lost your place and cant find what ever interesting pins you spotted.",,,

2024/3/24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app has always been a great source of inspiration and it was always fan browsing for pins to save. The only problem I have (and a lot of users from what I can tell) is the removal of the picture option in the comments.
