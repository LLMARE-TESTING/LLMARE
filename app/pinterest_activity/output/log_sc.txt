2 years later & I'm still obsessed! However, why is it soooooo easy to hide pins by mistake? It's easier to do that than to actually pin something to your boards. Then you can't undo or see what you've hidden. Everything I've hidden has been by mistake .. LITERALLY & it's concerning bc a pin I dont see might be the 1 pin I need to make my page blow?. just saying, fixing that would be plus. Possibly a simple "Are you sure?" would help. Overall, the app is perfect ?

So far the app has been getting systematically fixes after any issues, stellar job. But the new feature that I can't save pin directly to boards and instead it places them all as a big mess in my "profile" is frustrating.

I LOVED the app but they released an update that has really messed up when you try to save a pin it used to suggest the most likely board you would pin to for that particular subject matter, but now it pops you to the VERY bottom of your list of boards and suggests new boards or it saves it to your "profile" and doesn't even suggest your boards at all and if your not fast enough to "change" it from the new "profile" you have to go into your boards, into your Profile. Super frustrating!馃憥

I love pinterest. It is a wonderful collection of ideas. It is fun and easy to use, but there are a few issues. When there are ads or pins that are in a video format, the audio for them will play even if you're not on that pin. Also, if there are any kinds of videos on a page, it will pause any sort of music or video that is playing in another app.

The app (usually) is fine enough for accessing Pinterest, but any time something is amiss, there's no way to report bugs from within the app. Plus, it seems that recently they added a strange clicking sound only when hitting the button to save a post to your boards while viewing the post directly, with no way to turn it off despite there being no other audio in the app outside of watching videos.

ABYSMAL. The app is slow, it often won't upload at all, refuses to save downloads to boards, and when it does, it's apt to save the pictures to the WRONG boards!! 馃が

Pinterest has been one of my favorite apps. But however I have deleted a board and if i want to create another board with the same name it's showing as 'you have another board with the same name'. Pls try to fix this issue. Other than that this app is a perfect 5 star.

I love pinterest and have used it for about as long as I've had a cell phone, but lately it's been giving me a lot of trouble with saving pins. I'm an artist so I have multiple boards for inspiration for poses, fashion, etc. And I've missed out on saving so many inspiring pins because the save button completely disappeared on me. I've restarted my phone, logged out and back in, and nothing changed, it's quite frustrating.

The app was great until the update where it automatically saves everything to your profile. Why would you make me go through more steps just to save a photo or recipe?? Why would I bother making boards if they're going to make the app useless by throwing them all together and making me save them twice. Hoping they get rid of this "feature" in the next update. It's annoying.

The search function has become borderline unusable recently, the same searches I've done in the past now display no results.

Overall I love using Pinterest, it's a very good app to scroll mindlessly on but the new update makes it extremely difficult to do so. I used to be able to go to sections on my boards and use the 'mire ideas' feature to find new specific pins for that section, but thanks to the new update they've removed this awesome feature. Now you can only use 'more ideas' on the board as a whole, which basically removes any point to making sections besides having a slightly more organised board.

Sometimes the feature that lets you search for things or view your own boards disappears and does not come back for quite some time. I've tried scrolling up and down and restarting the app to make it reappear and it does not work. I use Pinterest for reference photos for my art. It can be pretty annoying when you're in the middle of a project.

I really like this app. Great way to keep track of just about everything from cooking recipes to diy projects, hobbys, fashion, leisure activity's etc. Endless possibilities. I just feel the homepage can be a bit busy trying to show all your interests simultaneously. Would be nice to somehow tweak the UI to be less cluttered, at least on a mobile device.

I love creating collections of both useful and fun things. I have recently started organizing my largest boards into sub-categories since it's not convenient to scroll for a long time looking for a particular pin with 1k pins in a board. I am enjoying it. However, it would be appreciated if the process of moving pins from a board to its sub-categories be easier and faster. At least on mobile I have to scroll past all of the sub-categories. Slow process even when moving max number of pins.

Notifications are a bit weird. When I'm outside of the app, I'll get comments and replies that show up in my notification bar. But when I click them, it won't bring me to the comment, it'll just bring me to my Pinterest homepage. I can look through my notifications in the app, but not all comments show up. This happens EVERY time, I've never been able to see what people reply to me.

idk what happened. I used to just keep scrolling for a while with endless pictures but now when scrolling the suggested images just end. also when I'm trying to look through all my boards alphabetically it'll just skip right back to where A starts. I can't even look at all my pins (like S or T) without it freaking out and scrolling back up to A. annoying.

It is very good at recommending content relavent to you. One of my favorite apps. I waste alot of time on it. Great for fandoms. Sometimes it has its moments, but bugs are usually fixed quickly. One of my only complaints is that when you return to the home page it reloads. Which to me is a little annoying because I'll see a pin i like and want to save but usually before i can tap it the page refreshes and its gone :\ but thats pretty much the only complaint. Would definately recommend!

love the app, but there are some things that are annoying. When you go back onto the homepage not too long after, your feed resets automatically, not being able to find the pins before it restarted, nothing. It's annoying because it automatically decides to refresh my page without me doing so and not being able to browse the pins I'd like. Pinterest also sent me several emails saying they've removed pins from my board and ones I've created, and doesn't show which pins or lets me send an appeal.

I really like this app for it's content and it's ease of navigation, but editing something you posted is impossible. Every time I click edit to maybe add a description, for example, it doesn't STAY ON the edit page. It will open for to enable edit and then it doesn't stay there. It RIGHT AWAY closes the edit portion and I can't add anything. Please fix this. I can't add or change anything. Edits are no longer possible.

I love Pinterest, but it could use 2 quality of life updates: 1. Update the reorder function. When using a separate layout for reordering, its almost impossible to tell how the final layout will look. This is incredibly frustrating when trying to get pins to be in a specific order. 2. More of a request, but it would be really cool if you had the ability to create sections within sections.
