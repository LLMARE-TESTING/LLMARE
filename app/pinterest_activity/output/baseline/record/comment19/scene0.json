When you go back onto the homepage not too long after, your feed resets automatically, not being able to find the pins before it restarted, nothing. It's annoying because it automatically decides to refresh my page without me doing so and not being able to browse the pins I'd like. Pinterest also sent me several emails saying they've removed pins from my board and ones I've created, and doesn't show which pins or lets me send an appeal.",
