Every time I update a pin in my board the date when I last uploaded won't change.

Everything overall is great. There's just one issue; I can't make my private boards public. I've made two new boards in the last few months, and they were automatically set as private. I've looked through the 'Edit Board' section of my private boards and can't find the settings that change a board to private and public.

['The app freezes and closes when the user clicks on something outside of their main page.', 'The user had to update the app to create a new board.']I've been using this app for almost 3 years, and it's a great app. But since last one month the app isn't working at all! Everytime when I open this app, the homepage is always loading, but never refreshes. Instead it says "User not found". At first I thought it was my device's problem. But now I can't even open the app. Please fix whatever problem is going on with it as soon as possible.

However, why is it soooooo easy to hide pins by mistake? It's easier to do that than to actually pin something to your boards. Then you can't undo or see what you've hidden. Everything I've hidden has been by mistake .. LITERALLY & it's concerning bc a pin I dont see might be the 1 pin I need to make my page blow?. just saying, fixing that would be plus.

['Accidentally hiding pins because it is very easy to do so, more so than pinning something to boards.', 'Inability to undo or view pins that have been hidden by mistake.']So far the app has been getting systematically fixes after any issues, stellar job.

['The user attempts to save a pin directly to boards, but instead, the pins are not saved to the intended boards and are placed in the user\'s "profile" in a disorganized manner.']I LOVED the app but they released an update that has really messed up when you try to save a pin it used to suggest the most likely board you would pin to for that particular subject matter, but now it pops you to the VERY bottom of your list of boards and suggests new boards or it saves it to your "profile" and doesn't even suggest your boards at all and if your not fast enough to "change" it from the new "profile" you have to go into your boards, into your Profile.

Would definately recommend!
