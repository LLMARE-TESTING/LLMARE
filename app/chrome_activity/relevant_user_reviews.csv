"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't figure out how to fix the teensy non-flowable font size when I try to play solitaire. The words and icon are half the cell phone width. If I stretch the screen to make it better, the copy doesn't reflow to fit the screen...it just gets so big that I have to jiggle the copy or image left to right. this weird screen appearance happened suddenly yesterday on my Nokia phone. No idea what to do. Asaaaargh!!!!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I have to track down and gut the app because it suddenly stops working and any attempt at troubleshooting is left empty with no answers, I am not going to think fondly of it. Luckily, once I did find it, uninstalled all its updates and left it pretty much an empty shell before reinstalling its updates, ultimately resulting in it being more like a Windows web page than an app. I got it to work, and all I cost me was a searchbar on my home page and the fear that it would fail the next update."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Normally, it's really good, but just recently, the app has not been opening. It opens and immediately closes until I get a message that says, ""The Google app keeps stopping."" And then tells me to close the app. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but it does no good. I've tried restarting my phone, but nothing works. This is super disappointing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Closing tabs leaves a small ""Undo"" pop-up on the bottom of the current page that DOESN'T TIMEOUT. So if your web page has buttons on the bottom of it, the ""Undo"" pop-up will block access to them. Closing tabs should not block your current webpage with an ""Undo"" pop-up that does not time out. The workaround is to switch to another app and that will remove the ""Undo"" pop-up. This however is highly inconvenient."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why did you take features away? When you open a new tab, by default, the ""Discover"" page comes up where articles you might be interested in pop up. You used to be able to open these articles in a group of tabs so they would be seperate from the rest of your web pages, but for some reason you can't do that anymore. Also, unrelated but why do you just assume that when I paste something into the search bar with a space at the end that the space was a mistake. Please stop automatically deleting them"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google products have been kind of disappointing. The app decides when it feels like speaking the results you asked for or just showing you searches. If we're asking, we're probably wanting an spoken response and not a list of searches. Otherwise we'd use a regular search engine. When you need it to do something on the screen.. it doesn't work if you've used it at any point before closing all yours apps. It gets stuck in some glitch where screen search buttons don't show up at all. Low quality"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Needs more features: when highlight text, the small menu that appears could have a `search`option that opens the browser to search for the highlighted text with options in setting to enable/disable and choose to set it to search in private tab or normal tab. Also the option to open the link in another app. E.g., visiting X in browser shows the option in the browser's menu to open in X app. In settings, have the option to automatically delete everything: always or every: day/week/month/year"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The latest version of Google Chrome delivers a streamlined browsing experience with impressive speed and enhanced security features. The interface is clean and intuitive, and cross-device syncing works efficiently. However, the app can be resource-intensive, occasionally causing slowdowns and crashes. Users may also experience occasional syncing delays. Despite these issues, Chrome remains a strong choice for reliable and fast web browsing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Does what you'd hope in a browser, but frequently comoels you to their latest and greatest organizing features weather you want them or not, and crashes constantly when selecting the search box when using Google keyboard; Literally the most used item in the app and has been ongoing for over a year. Not all apps need latest-and-greatest features, and they must absolutely perform their primary function flawlessly. Google can do better, but choses not to here."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Google Chrome is cumbersome. to many options too many settings. I speak for most people when I say apps including emails have gotten bloated with junk tools that nobody will ever use. Sending my attorney PDFs and a couple pictures and it takes 30 minutes. Because it don't like file type. Have to open another app to change the file type to finally send it. Apps have way too many useless tools that nobody uses. need to make these apps streamlined so that technology is fast quick easy to navigate
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The last update decided to configure chrome as the default text file viewer. Isn't that just so great, chrome isnt even the default web viewer app on my phone so thank you google as to just taking the text association. It erks me when programmers make assumptions and apply them via update. But then it is google, so f, not surprised. For everything else this app is great, esp for websites which open up their own code which needs to function in isolation."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately I needed to change to another browser to be able to complete my e-learning modules for work. Google Chrome would not play some of the sections correctly to allow me to finish the course to gain the certificate. Disappointed, as always used Chrome previously, the alternative browser I chose worked great and was not slow or buggy when responding to the video screen buttons."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bookmarks, both the widget and in app, constantly freeze. The only way to fix it is uninstall and reinstall. This happens constantly. Super annoying. Still doing it 8 months later on a different phone. Ridiculous. Clearing the cache doesn't work. Edit 8/24/24 - here we are, nearly a year later and this issue is still not fixed. Unbelievable!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently Google has pushed through several changes that have soured my experience with the browser. First, there was google lens (not as good as the original image search feature and frequently buggy). And now there is AI overview. I don't want AI search results shoved in my face when I go onto google and I want the option to opt-out of them. If this doesn't change, then I'll be looking for another internet browser since it's clear Google thinks it knows best and doesn't want to give me choices."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app version of Chrome, which is a good basic browser. It is not the best browser based app. I wish it would be better organized. It has some really cool features. Something else I am not that fond of is the size of the app and the memory it uses. Lately has been crashing and I've been losing data. Still crashing constantly and nothing has changed."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is is probably the BEST browser of them allüòÅ especially on my desktop. When my computer shuts down abruptly, chrome always ask me do I want to open up the last page so I didn't lose anything which is great but for some strange reason ""it"" has become a virus on the very device I'm sending this review fromüò≥ It just pops up and even does so even if I press another appüò™ Other than that one problem, it's a Great appüòÅ"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App keeps crashing/ ""won't respond"" suddenly. Chrome is my go to but suddenly it stop working. All support links say to open Chrome and send a repost but I can't even open Chrome to do that. Will change once fixed."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Something keeps popping up in a pop-up view via chromes web view, and there is no way for me to stop it, or so it seems. Can Google Devs please figure this out. Until it's resolved in going to start using a different browser. Ps. This also happened with the Samsung internet browser, if that helps at all."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love chrome, and among the dozens of things I like about this browser is two things, reliability and concurrent browsing on multiple tabs in a single group - a feature it now fails horribly at making the latter just as horrible. Imagine opening a few tabs in a single group tab. Seconds after opening the last tab you try to revisit the the last tab and it's refreshing like you're just opening it. Usually you'd just continue where you left off. Fix that please. Still the best browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My only issue is that only the Images tab background darkened to the point that I can't see most of the words on images only the web site names and search bar. I toggled the dark mode on & off, restarted app, but it doesn't change it and the Help doesn't have a section about it. It works in desktop site and incognito mode. How do I fix it?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The UI looks too boring with literally no wallpapers, theme and customization options compared to Opera and there are tons of safe websites that open on firefox and opera but not on Chrome. I felt an update would fix that. But hell no. !!! And yes, there's no respect for users from Google because you ARROGANT guys don't ever reply to any of our comments."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love google and all its features. However, there is an issue that I am having, and every time I open the web browser on my phone, it closes itself. I have tried restarting my phone, uninstalling it, and reinstalling it. Nothing has worked. Please fix this issue."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No matter what I do in settings(I'm only screwing up other things), I'm trying to figure out why sites can't access my location. When I've allowed it. It's been years of frustration. Seems like after I update a new device. This happens. I've checked everywhere for answers. I'd love to rate it 5 stars. But seeing as I can't even get AAA help due to this issue. "" Close any bubbles or overlays from other apps, then try again"" There is no overlay. I don't understand. And I don't know what to do."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this browser for almost 12 years and during these last 4-5 years of surfing with this browser, it has improved it's interface as well as the browsing speed as well. The most loving feature of Chrome is if your network goes off during surfing anything, it smoothly saves the surfing page as an offline page and later on you can easily access the page whenever your Network system comes back to it's track. N.B- I will keep updating my further experiences later too.üëç"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app, brouser to use. Someone has hacked my google, chrome, and device account, and all apps features on this device and have connected to their computer. Tracking watching and stealing and giving my data to concerned third party. How can I get rid of it. If you can google and chrome get rid of me from this problem, do it earliest possible. Thanks. With regards."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"September 14 2024. ""Google keeps stopping"" flashing across my screen again and again. No kidding. It's suddenly non-functional out of nowhere. Why? Crashing & crashing & crashing. Did settings, cleared out history & etc..., plenty of memory, RAM, storage on my year old Pixel phone. Crash crash crash goes Google. FRUSTRATING."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Suddenly, the Google app will not stay open. Opens for 2 seconds, then closes. Any idea why? It's been working fine until 9/14/2024. Chrome app still works no problem (thankfully). The Google app is a 5 star app, but I gotta it 2 stars for now. Back to 5 stars once resolved."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The recent update keeps crashing the google site. I haven't been able to open the other websites or apps on my homescreen which require google chrome. It keeps mentioning to 'Install' or 'Open' Google Chrome every time i open related apps or websites from the homescreen.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The transition to manifest v3 is the end. Google is losing me as a customer slowly. I've been loyal for years, but so much has changed since Google first started, and not for the better. Might I suggest future users consider a different, non-chromium based browser like Firefox."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been crashing nonstop lately for the past few hours, I would appreciate it if you guys were to fix this issue. Update:the issue was thankfully fixed, it was probably a recent update that occurred when google started crashing, but now it's fixed thanks üòÅüëç"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear Google Chrome Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express a request for the inclusion of extension support in the Google Chrome browser for Android. Currently, the lack of this feature significantly limits the browser's functionality and user experience on mobile devices. Extensions are a vital part of the desktop browsing experience, enhancing productivity, security, and customization. Implementing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolute garbage update. Until recently Google Chrome was my browser of choice. Against my better judgement I updated the app and now I'm at the point of uninstalling. Now every time I log in anywhere I am presented with options of entering old log-ins and passwords and credit card details (for some idiotic reason) and no opportunity to actually type in a password or change log-in details. Is it too much to ask for an actual kepboard?
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""No Internet connection"" shouldn't be there on top of the browser while we connect to our independent networks and when we connect to a WiFi it disappears, I hate it precisely it needs to be disappear so we can surf online without looking at it, it's awful as if you don't have any data nor have any bundle to browse."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why are Google and Youtube getting progressively worse? What happened to just being able to type in a URL and just go to that website? It auto completes if you have ever been to another page on that site making you have to actually google.the website and go through there. God forbid you type in a URL and miss one letter because you cannot edit it, you have to retype the whole thing. Not to mention searches not being relevant to what you type in after 5 or 6 sites. Bring back 2008 please"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm done with chrome. Search results are not relevant. It's a major issue, that makes the web search unusable. Issue is even more severe on mobile. Not relevant searh results mean top 10 results on other languages other than search query. I've been sending multiple feedbacks, with no results. Didn't have this issue ever on edge and bing"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wish my workplace didn't have to rely on using their app through Chrome. Causes authentication problems when signing in & I constantly have to update this app more than others pretty much everyday. I don't have login problems when using any other chromium browser on mobile. Chrome just sucks on mobile.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I use Google on the Chrome, I can't search what I want search directly, always make the search for 3 times then the chrome search start. This bug has been 6 months. please fix it quickly. Thank you."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is Phenomenal!! The sheer amount of functionality this app has especially accessibility & sharing options is üíØ I recommend using chrome as a browser versus Safari or Bing. Or set your homepage option to Bing, etc if need be & stay signed in. Which brings me to why I didn't give it 5 stars... Safari has excellent security features while it seems with Chrome, we're left defending our devices against malware ourselves when browsing. Also Microsoft (Bing) offers rewards. Does Chrome?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My app isn't working through the widget. It instantly crashes when I open the search bar. I will change review when it's fixed. I am on the S23 Ultra Galaxy. I have tried restarting my phone and force stopping the app. Neither have worked.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You have a bug. Other people are having issues with it as well. It's not recognizing that we are signed in and whenever we open Chrome it pops up showing our account and then whenever we tap on the account it goes to our account manager page in the phone settings. Google wants to keep giving terrible suggestions like sign out and sign back in I have tried that and it only works for a period of time and then it starts up again. Fix this bug. Don't give me any suggestions that don't work
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google is a highly revered entity in the digital realm, but ironically, its Chrome browser stands out as the slowest among its counterparts. Despite Google's impressive array of innovative products and services, Chrome's sluggish performance is a notable exception, lagging behind other browsers in terms of speed and efficiency."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tapping on websites, such as YouTube and X, show nothing but a blank screen. I've updated the app and cleared it's cache multiple times, but this still happens. Pretty irritating, if you ask me. Edit: Why would I be opening this app if I wasn't connected to the internet?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am disappointed in the problems with the chrome browser. Pages black out for no reason. And I have to open a new tab. I have lost work done on the page that blacked out. You don't care because you have to have chrome on your android cell for the cell to work correctly. Monopoly is what this is regardless of the lack of quality.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the updated and relevant responses that Google provides in feedback. The language used from my end of things can complicate the result however, it's prompt and relatively accurate. Android phones as a rule now, I'm struggling with as I've been the victim of fraud and online debt."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am very disappointed, i have disabled the dynamic color from chrome flags but still the colors of the google apps changes when i change my lock screen. This is ridiculous, please resolve this issue. I have searched this on internet, apparently it is something about the material you program."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the app is useful in different ways but I believe there is room for improvement especially with the translation. I also think a feature should be available where one can snap an image of something he/she doesn't know or hasn't seen before and be able to ask for help identifying such."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It crashed every time I return to the page. How can I be working on something online only to minimize and leave for some seconds only to return to continue with what I was doing then the page refreshes by itself thereby returning my work to the point of zero? What is that?
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So I gave an honest rating of 4 stars about a year ago in 2023 explaining some of the issues I kept on encountering and received zero response to the issue that still continues to plaque me every so often still in regards to your app. So my best guest is the developers are aware of the problem since after all Google Chrome automatically comes installed on cell phones or notebook or other devices & clearly states the accompany project LINUX sucks! DO NOT INSTALL! 2 ‚≠ê‚≠ê's 1 year later & 0 response
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update : issue fixed, hope it doesn't happen again.. It always crashes eventually. Whenever i use it for 1-2 weeks. It always crashes. And i have to clear data.. Everything i saved i tabs is gone.. Its really annoying.."

Screen automatically goes sleep while watching videos after screen sleep time set for my handset (15 seconds). I have to tap screen or use volume key ..... to keep my screen on. Fix this issue ASAP. It's so annoying."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do not like that, there's constant vulnerabilities. That exposes breach and safety concerns. My active armor scans red flag this constantly. On both the phone and devices and apparently, I've yet to figure out how to completely remove it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what was in the last update but now it keeps crashing literally every 30 seconds no matter what I'm looking at. This is your own browser on your own operating system and it has functioned flawlessly for years until this update. Absolute enshittification.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is a browser I can trust with my data and online browsing activities. Between Microsoft and Google, because of the fact that I grew up in the 1980's and received my first computer when I was 13 years of age, my choice would be Microsoft. I realise that I was and am much fortunate to own a computer at such a young age. Even a full time working couple back then would have struggled to buy a computer outright, I guesstimate the computer would have been equivalent to buying a car in that era!"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Technically functional, but the mobile UX team seems insistent on wasting as much screen space as possible on completely useless and non-functional things Replaces half my tab bar with labels that all say ""1 tab"" letting me know that all of the tabs which I could see the titles of if those useless labels were not present are in groups with only 1 tab each.... To say nothing of the tab grouping feature itself which hypothetically could be useful, but also suffers horrible UX design"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For what this app is capable of and what one can accomplish with it - There is no better Internet Web Browser. However - I do not appreciate being tracked - if opting to use a different browser, or being in the middle of a matter - whereas my personal information is blurted out on the form or page that I am conducting business on.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been through many different phones, and one issue that persists is that with every new phone, chrome doesn't want to work. It asks me to wait or close app. No offense but if you are going to market a phone, then the apps it comes with better work properly. I always forget how to fix the issue and have to try everything all over again. I don't know itlf this is a chrome issue or a phone issue, but something needs to be done."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been dealing with all kinds of scam callers starting at 6am up until 10pm. A friend checked into my phone and found it was the google Chrome account all these irritating calls were coming from. She showed me by disabling the Chrome app. Sure enuff all the scam calls stopped. Then I found that I couldn't get on line with that account disabled. So I enabled it to get online and all the scam calls start happening again. I'm not impressed with chrome. I would delete it completely but can't.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Chrome is good browser but the issue is that when we open any website it sometimes ask to allow notifications but don't be foolish to click allow pls press deny as we'll get nonsense notifications and clicking on them will give our mobile a virus. I have fallen for it once because I was i and hurry and the notifications they gave me like really. Chrome pls check what notifications they provide. This review was written by my mother and she faced the same. they provide inappropriate notifications

UPDATE: apparently google decided that a forced reboot of my phone was necessary. It happened overnight and now Chrome looks different but it still has the rendering Bug.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall Chrome is an innovative browser in multiple ways, pushing also into new grounds for what mobile apps are capable of being. Some suggestions: 1. The recent update with tab groups highlights the need for a short-cut (e.g. via a menu entry by the vertical ellipsis ‚ãÆ button). The reason is that it takes too long time to render the ""all the tabs"" preview screen (tens of seconds in case too many tabs opened). The cumulative effect that I personally observe is that more and more tabs gets opened and remain open, further bringing a hesitation and avoidance to open the whole app to begin with. 2. Opening a new tab sometimes opens the tab in the middle of all the existing tabs. This random behavior is annoying. I think the tab should (by default) be opened as the rightmost tab."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how Chrome keeps automatically grouping tabs, can it be disabled? Chrome on my Windows 7 pc is still better than Microsoft Internet Explorer... But it's no longer the fast/small browser that it initially was. in fact each update :- 1. it's getting slower. 2. User's ability to configure Chrome to suit their needs is being removed with each update."

Also sometimes when I tap on a search icon in a webpage, the keyboard comes up but no typing field. I type but it goes nowhere. Lastly I noticed that some links on webpages don't work, but when I use another browser, it works just fine. Come on Google, you are better than this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please bring back the old tab UI. I cant stand tab groups in grid mode, and a visual view of the tabs is quick and intuitive rather than trying to remember text. I'm using an old apk for Chrome 74. It's insecure, but it works.

You still have the ability to open new tabs outside of grid view, why not let us do that quickly and efficiently like we USED TO BE ABLE TO DO. Now we can ONLY use grid view, if trying to quickly open new tabs for research, work, or anything else you want to do efficiently.

While other browsers are leaning more and more into one-hand UI, chrome is getting more difficult to use on avarage screen phones. Devs disabled the option to move the search and men√º to the bottom of the screen, introduced tab groups that creates a group automatically (that is very annoying) and now it went to ""list view"" in opened tabs, so its only text with icons. The worst of all, is that there isn't any option to customise the UI. Devs are on LSD."

So I uninstalled the app and when reinstalled the app it started working fine, but it shows the option of update, and if I update, I again start facing the same problem, so now apparently I am using the older version of chrome. Kindly look into this bug. Thank you."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible and heavy handed approach with forced group tabs/ grid layout. The new group tab/ grid layout is, in my opinion, horrible and unintuitive. However, I understand that some people may like it as it truly is a subjective thing. That said, I despise Google's approach of forcing the feature down our throats with each update. Give us back the option to disable the group tab/ grid layouts at our discretion."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Browser opens on its own. Over the past 2-3 weeks Chrome windows are opening on their own to webpages I don't know. I don't have a virus/malware etc. Android phone is clean. It just seems to be the browser itself and I can't get it to stop. Can't uninstall (only the updates). Have cleared everything imaginable. Making me want to go iPhone at this point.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am really pleased with the recent update.They now include the option to either show or hide the suggested articles that show up first thing on the screen so it is convenient for both parties that either want news stories on their browser or don't, so it's a win-win situation. I hope that the creaters of this browser keep it up. Browser is fast as always."

Lately the links don't open, I just get a white bar across the top of the screen. Rather than letting me type my complete my search request the app suggests other apps stored on my phone after typing the first letter. The keyboard disappears and I have to wait for the app suggestions then start my search again. I thought it might have been a phone issue but its happening on my husbands chrome app too."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest layout sucks. Apart from back, all main chrome buttons (menu, new tab etc) are now at the top of the app/phone making them much harder to reach. Before they were all located on a pop out menu along the bottom which came out whenever you scrolled up, easy and convenient to use one handed. This is now a two handed operation. Very frustrating."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has been the best ever growing browser I have encountered due to the speedy access and graphics mode to mention a few. But of most recent after so many updates and and with changed features it becomes frustrating, because I couldn't find special dial feature which I use in other browser like opera mini. It would have been of great use and importance, because it gives me the perfect access for the forgotten sites which may come in handy at the perfect time of need."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been using Chrome for years and have been extremely happy with it. But like others have reported recently, this app has gone down the crapper.

As much as I enjoy seamless connection when using Chrome among all my devices, guess it's time to switch to Firefox."

It's highly inconvenient and no longer able to be turned off. I liked chrome, but not enough to keep me from switching browsers over this. There are a lot of good browsers that don't force group tabs."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's just fine, however I have a suggestion! In my chrome browser I have plenty of open tabs some of which I can lose track of sometimes, so I was thinking what if you implemented a feature where you could change the position of the tabs to help with organization, and etc. just like in the chrome browser for computers. I honestly think that this is worth looking into, but other than that the app is pretty much perfect. (Edit: Thank you for implementing some organization.)"

Chrome should act strictly on that. Also there are some major bugs in the latest version (June 2, 2021). (1) On first opening, the search bar does not works. We've to tap on tabs and then it works. (2) When a website grabs a lot of memory chrome should pop up the ""Show Original"" button like previous version. Hope the developers solve these issues."

Chrome has turned into such terrible piece of s**t that, after using it since it first launched for desktop, I'm now actively seeking an alternative. I wish I could give less than zero stars. Edit: Firefox. Better, faster, and importantly: actually works"

Devs have stated they are aware of the issue... but haven't fixed it yet. At this point it's got 3 month old security patches. I can't continue to safely use it. I would recommend removing all permissions and disabling it. Since its integrated into the OS it is risk to the entire phone.

Once I can get this updated and try it out, I can redo my rating....but as of right now, its at the tops, a 2. UPDATE... more than 4 months later and I'm still unable to update this app!!

Look no further than this browser, but if you must, Maps, and Play Music are a couple other examples."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No doubt that the new and cluttered tab UI was pushed out untested by any average userbase, otherwise Google would've seen how unintuitive it is and never released it. As usual, this will be another forced change that users will have to get used to, with no option to revert it. You will now have a permanent bar on the bottom of the screen whenever you scroll up, with smaller thumbnails when previewing tabs. Your tabs will also now be cluttered up in a 'group', a feature no one is interested in."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What could be more simple than turning off the audio search results. You can do it on the Windows 10 version but the Android version is completely bombastic. What could be more embarrassing then having everyone listen to your search results in a public space. I realize the smartphone is meant to make noise and you're supposed to make noise to it but the word control is a keyword in human life and death.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been decent, but some of the security features are completely broken. On-device encryption, for example, doesn't work as it should. Even when signing in to new devices, I'm unable to access my passwords, etc. The screen just changes size and does the whirling circle and then displays the exact same message screen from the device I was locked out on. That device should not have been locked out. So now I've got no passwords saved according to some versions of the app, or a whole slew of them."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really like using Chrome. The grouping tabs update were sudden but I was able to get used to it and it actually worked fine. But suddenly the grid tab layout were gone! Now my tabs are all mixed up and unorganised. Please make in optional at the very least. I also have been having an error trying to install the said new update? I am definitely not enjoying this.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UI is NOT user-friendly. Tall phones are the norm, but Chrome on Android insists on a top-centric UI. Even Chrome's old bottom-centric UI, Duet, was deliberately removed, despite its intuitiveness. The new Tab Strip helped, yet it never stayed up, failed to offer the menu, & was merely an experiment. But that's gone too. & so is the vertical tab stack: No more thumbing through open tabs w/ one hand, the Grid can't be disabled. Google seems uninterested in designing Chrome for phone users."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Over all, this is a nice & secure browser. But at times we need to open a web page just like on a computer. Desktop view on this Android web browser differs from the same page on a computer. Hence some blanks in some applications can't be filled up. So, please provide the same page view on this browser as on computer. Otherwise, it is superb in all aspects."

The new home page icons look terrible - all they did was take the old icons, shrink them, and put them inside a circle. And all the UI elements are now unnecessarily rounded. Technically the app still functions to browse the web, but the interface is god awful."

But after having the same tabs open in other groups or having issues due to dyslexia, I just can't be patient enough with it anymore. And it definitely doesn't seem to help data or efficiency. Also, can't update my chrome. It hasn't given me any issues because I can't, but the RED arrow gets me worried when I forget it's just an update button.

If you hate the tab grid layout, uninstall version 91.0.4472.120 (released 6/22/21) and disable via the chrome flags menu. Otherwise you're stuck with it and have no other way to opt-out. Only other option is to get a new browser app and don't look back. (11/03/21) If you update to Android 12, it automatically makes Chrome into tab layout with no way to turn it off. I HATE THIS."

I absolutely hate the grid view and think we should at least be given the option, especially since you're forcing the updates on us. For me its impractical, harder to find my pages and I don't like that opening a link from a page automatically groups the tabs. It's poor customer service response. I'm probably finding a different mobile browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chrome used to work fine until the last couple of months. I got all of the following at different times: screen flashing; screen blank; and the screen overlaying itself until the screen is a blur. The only fix that has worked for me is to clear the app of ALL data and the cache. You have to sign back in but it seems to work. This could be a non issue if Chrome would get onto the above problems and fix them. I've used Chrome for years and now it's having problems. Why? More flashing. Why?

I'm not sure what changed, but now it is unbearably slow opening, closing, switching between tabs, browsing, and just slow and almost unusable. All of the other apps on my phone are fine.

All to the point of using a different browser. If they don't fix this soon I will ultimately switch. The other thing about the update is that now when you close all tabs it doesn't open up a new one with your homepage. I loved the old feature with the ease of doing so.

No, no it's not. The new features suck."

I have to leave and I have bust one real quick you know what I'm saying! I can find my porn a whole lot faster than using other search engines.

Yeah I love Google!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The group tabs being an epic fail seems to be the general consensus... Something that was easy to use became unnecessarily more complicated. Why can't you choose between group tabs and the old style tabs in settings? That seems like a win-win.. I was able to revert back to the old style tabs with several attempts and a 1/2 hour of googling... But when Chrome updated it went back to the forced group tabs again!! Why is this not a choice option in settings?? Come on, Google!"

When I open the 'app update' option, this window opens but the update button is inactive. This has been the case for 3 weeks now. Otherwise, the app is great! I use it at home and work! Fix this issue and I will update my review to 5 stars... Months later and issue persists, now the update button is available but does not update after pressing it even hours later."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome WAS my favorite mobile browser for years. But it seems these times are gone. It's still fine on 11 and 13 androids. But on Android 14 it's too buggy. For example: 1. touch behaviour is extremely weird while page scrolling. 2. If page has embedded videos, it's normal to lower browser fps to video frame rate. Ofc this could be not chrome issue, but Android or Android web engine, but other browsers don't have these issues. Google, what is happening to you? Where is your QA ?("
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Note the many 1 star reviews. I HATE that my preference to manually update was apparently over ridden and that I now am forced to use this now crappy looking app. It would be ok if if the update was an improvement. It isn't. It looks horrible and is cumbersome to navigate: the look and feel are awkward and inelegant. And, there's no easily apparent way to reset to manual update preference. I suppose that's because the way the app looks and works and feels is now so crappy, many would elect to revert to an earlier version. The inability to do so forces us to work with what is. As it us now, you can't even uninstall the update. Google: not so good any more."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While I strongly appreciate the ecosystem in which Google has created, there is a feature in the Chrome Android mobile app that is absolutely frustrating and WILL push me to finally make the switch to a different browser both on mobile and desktop if it is not retracted or at least given the user an option to disable it. That ""feature"" is... GROUP TABS. I do not for the life of me understand why this would be implemented without still having the option to open a link in a new (non group) tab."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update totally messed the UI. I am using the Duet feature for almost an year. Having all controlls at the bottom is really convinient. Having in mind that almost all new phones have 6"" or bigger screens this feature is a must. However some genius at Google desided that it is a great idea to put only half of the buttons at the bottom and the other half at the top without any way to configure that. I am really interested to understand the thought process behind this decision!?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not working with system update AT ALL. Data was reset multiple times and still a no go. Developer, the browser just idles. I have two phones and your suggestions are unhelpful, to say the least."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first i was uncomfortable with the new layout being grouped and stuff, but then i was used to it. But now suddenly it went back to the old layout where it become vertical. I don't know what google want to do exactly. It better to just stick to one of the layout or else just make it customable to choose which layout we want, rather than switching it back and forth like this"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have always used this app. But now its unusable! When I open it, its a 75% chance it will open a blank page which is frozen and won't do anything. So I have to shut and open again after a few seconds. Also when it does work, you start typing in the search bar, and it'll freeze and delete everything I wrote, close the keyboard and go back to the search bar. This has gone from the best to the worst unfortunately. Please fix these issues!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Even on flagship devices, boot time is awful. It takes 4-6 seconds to boot. (Snapdragon 845) Switching tabs is not convenient since the button to do so is placed at the top of the screen. If devs only gave the option to move the nav bar at the bottom of the screen, and speed up the boot, it would be perfect. Everything else is great. Until then, I'll probably be using Opera on mobile and also on desktop (just to keep things in sync)"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what issue I am facing with chrome. It's automatically refreshing the page even I can't click a new webpage. Worst experience. Due to this switching to operate browser
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Up until the most recent update, it was fine. Now when I close a tab, then exit the browser, then relaunch it, the tab (or tabs) that I closed are all back open. I've cleared the cache/history in the browser, as well as reset the app entirely, and it's STILL doing this... You've GOT to fix this, it's a major issue. Nothing like the app taking a month to open, because there are 80 tabs I can't close."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I type in the site I'm looking for and something totally different shows up, or I just open chrome and web sites I didn't ask for just start opening on there as soon as I open the app. Not good sites open without typing anything. Wish could uninstall it but it is stuck on my phone, I guess so they can watch what I'm doing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constantly freezes, been doing that for months now! And on 2 different phones that have plenty of power. It happens while scrolling a page, it simply stops and doesn't react anymore. I can then either wait for 30 secs or switch to another app and back, then it's usable again. Useless as a browser! Tried the Beta version, same thing. This is ridiculous!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update it started bugging out on me. Now and again when I'm in the middle of a search the browser will close and a text box pops up saying ""Unfortunately, Google chrome has stopped working."" Thereby causing me to have to start my search all over again. The previous version wasn't like this at all. I use google chrome because it's safer faster and more secure than the default web browser on android phones. Please fix this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New Features I like the password scanning option, but make it easier to delete compromised ones as well as multiples of the same password (sort by date, multi-select would work) This bs where I can't login to the free wifi around town cause it's a redirect is retarded. McDonald's isn't trying to fish my account üôÑ, so I've been using Edge to get around it, at this point my preferred browser. Uses way less ram, The collections thing is pretty awesome, can use third party extensions."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new translate setting mode isn't user friendly like previous version. In previous version, there's a bar on the bottom of the page to choose between the original language and English, I can switch back and forth between two languages easily whilst learning new words. NOW, the bar disappeared, can't switch between easily, if I want to switch back to original language I have to click translate on menu and then undo the auto translate so it'll go back to original language, very inefficient."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having a lot of trouble sharing pages through the browser window pops up and nothing happens. Usually have to shut the app down to get it to work. Update: March 17, 2021 Since the last update, my share options are limited to only a handful of things like print and copy link. I am no longer able to share an article via text or to Instapaper. It's not my phone when I switch browsers; I have no problems."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been my browser since I got this phone. All features are working really well but after this recent update, something went wrong. I can't send a picture in FB because Chrome stops as it says. I can't even report it. This is just one problem I encountered (there's still more bugs in it) and it pushed me to uninstall this app just for now. I hope you fix this so I can use my favorite browser again. Thank you."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing my original review to tell how I feel about it now. It has a horrible operation that never fails to make me cringe every time I start using the otherwise decent Android browser again. If you are in your tab view mode, and accidentally press on the ""close all tabs"" option, then that's it, there is no way you can recover the works you have been doing. You can find maybe the last five tabs you closed in the ""recent tabs"" menu, but all the other tabs are gone. No option to undo or restore."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ui, I don't want to say too much about that, just too white. The real problem is there are always some parts of texts missing on every webpage, and when you selected these texts, sometimes the missing parts will appear, sometimes not. This update is ridiculous, what is the improvement in any aspect? The only thing I see is this app is becoming worse, so this is actually not an update but an DOWNdate or OUTdate."

I can't enjoy watching porn anymore üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ (just kidding about the porn part), nevertheless, the Chrome Browser is freezing alot.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've always used Chrome on Android and it is a great browser. Unfortunately it has been very buggy for me since a recent update: The update that moved the menu and bookmark options to the bottom of the screen. The options on the bottom of the screen only appear when scrolling upwards, which I'm fine with, however this seems to put all navigation options and buttons out of alignment. When the bottom bar is showing everything works fine, however when I scroll down and the bottom bar disappears no buttons on screen work anymore or the control is shifted away from where the button is represented to be. There are also visual problems, for example when clicking on an image on a site that allows it to show it full screen, if the bottom bar is displaying when it is clicked, the full screen image is shifted. Please fix so I can re-rate to 5* again! Thank you!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pros: It's fast, doesn't crash. Cons: some page elements often render too wide, pushing the margin wider than the body. So if you happen to pinch-zoom in then zoom back out, the body text shrinks where there's a big 2 cm gap between the text and the right side of the screen. So I have to manually zoom in so the text fills the screen, which pushes parts of big elements like images past the right margin, which means I have to scroll left and right to see all of those."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Usually this app is good, but from last two or three weeks,the app is crashing continuously. I've restated my phone, disable and re-enable the app,it doesn't even get a whole second before the app just turns off. Moreover, there is no update for the app, that may fix the error. But I uninstall and then reinstall it,and it is running smoothly. But It look like a pc's crome. Why?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too many graphics!! I just want to search. I did not need a visual graphic next to every result! It takes up so much real estate on mobiles. The graphic is bigger than the search summation leaving big gaps between each result. Then when you get to place where you have to hit more results it erupts into a total mess of graphic fillers. What a cluster!!!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used chrome since pretty much day one. I loved how customizable it was. I keep things very simple on all my programs. I don't keep a bunch of tabs open, and the new grid view is more cumbersome than helpful. The most recent update completely removes the ability to disable the grid view even if you disable the flags, and this is a deal breaker for this app for me. I hate it so much that chrome is now disabled and I'm switching to a different web browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You're seriously incapable of not making stupid changes, aren't you? What is with the change to the tabs!? It looks awful and the folder system is so clumsy and frustrating when I don't want it! I still hate the change to the pop-up window that appears when you tap and hold a URL link on a page. I still hate how the Search page function scrolls through the page to get to each result. On long pages it takes too long for the app to scroll to each one and it's annoying to wait for it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for 3 years, but for the past few months, I have encountered frequent issues. Pages freezing, website layout breaking, text input not showing up. I was worried that something was off with my hardware (even though I bought premium less than two years ago), so I ran a 2 weeks long test run on Firefox, only to encounter zero issue. Inconvenient to have to make the switch, but worth it at this point. You've lost a loyal user!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't support fullscreen. Supposing within a site you've clicked on an image or gallery to open that in a dedicated tab. Most images are landscape and you want to use all of your phones high res screen. If the image is displayed too large when you go landscape then you can sort of scroll a bit to get rid of the bar, but you can't see the whole image at once. If you can see the whole image then the ability to scroll doesn't exist so the bar stays. Either way you're stuck with no solution."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I was delighted to see the menu bar moved to the bottom of the screen. It makes it so much easier to move around sites...... OH WAIT that was on my iPhone! My Android still has the bar at the top with no option to change it. Really Google..... Really. Life is about choices. Give US the choice of a dark theme and to move the menu bar to the bottom of the page. Until you do I will continue to exercise my right of choice by using Microsoft Edge.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good browser in essence. But as of the last update (98.04758. 101) on Android 11, it started to be slow. Once I open the app it takes a while to show the start page, and if i tap on the link box it shoots me out of the app. It takes two or three attempts to use it properly. It might be a bug or something or really a local problem but it is worth taking a look at."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The page often freeze after a few minutes especially if an animation is running, and you will never be able to scroll again no matter how long you wait. Only if you switch to a different tab and return back to the page, or if you lock and unlock your device does it resume. Notes: *my device has abundant memory, storage, etc. *Other tabs are active so its not the entire browser that's frozen. *Also its been this way across a couple of previous versions."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm a long time Chrome user, and was taken aback by the recent UI changes. Why does everything need to be rounded, now? It looks like we went back to 2010. My biggest complaint, though, is the tab switcher view. The release notes say ""Clean modern design,"" but there is virtually no contrast between the tabs with the white on light gray on white color scheme. I went looking for a dark mode or theme and was disappointed to find out there's no such thing. Please bring back the old Chrome, or at least rework the mobile UI."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new features are good. One thing I don't like or appreciate is that the picture-in-picture feature is no longer in use (and a preview feature for videos on the home screen might be in its place). I like to multi-task on my phone, and that includes watching YT while doing something else. I'm not okay with not doing that anymore. Honestly, both can be utilized, but it's not cool that the PIP feature was dropped so suddenly. Please bring it back; it's much appreciated"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Simply the best, regardless of the device or OS that you are running it on, it's always reliable and very user-friendly. If you're having issues with it, it's probably because you don't know how to keep it updated and give it proper maintenance. Remember: Cleaning browsing history, cache, cookies, site setting, and temp files, etc. As well as keeping the amount of tabs to a minimum for maximum performance, will keep your app running smoothly while being secure that your data is in good hands!üëå"

Just got used to the navbar/menu on the bottom after it was changed a month or two ago, started to appreciate it a lot, only to have it switched back to top. Just give me a normal setting to chose the position, and not a flag. This may seem like a minor gripe, but it really messes with muscle memory- it completely changes the way I have to hold my phone!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usually a very reliable, clean experience. However, recently search pages have been randomly malfunctioning. I'm not sure what triggers it, but it will suddenly not allow me to click on any of the links listed. I can click on related questions and the links enclosed in those, but not what I actually searched for. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem. Even if I close all the tabs and exit the app, it takes right back to the still frozen page when I reopen it. Very frustrating."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While I like the new UI and overall look.. the latest update seems to have broken the way texts, on any webpage, are displayed. Letters, characters, etc. are cut off or missing all together. A refresh of the page seems to help but not always. Makes browsing almost impossible. Cleared data, uninstalled and reinstalled but it's still the same. Hopeful that a new update fixes the issue."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Chrome, I really do... but the app is *very* lackluster in the area of UI customizability. Any options for personalization are basically non-existent; there is no way to change the placement of any of its buttons, for example, or to choose which icons (or shortcuts) are displayed at the top of the hamburger menu... or just about anything else you could think of, really. That is its biggest drawback for me; other than that, everything else is pretty great!"

Yep."

It hangs with a blank screen and freezes the phone making it impossible to do anything. After a try or 2 it might actually work. When it works it's great.

It usually requires a reboot of my PC, phone, or tablet ater installing, but it is fast - usually less than a minute, maybe 3 minutes total, from start through the reboot.

Best part is is says in flags disabled and I can switch to any other version and it changes. It just won't stay the original version. :/"

As a browser bundled with android, it's major minus is that it hugs so much internal memory and the application size is crazy. Because of this many prefair to root their phones and remove it. For me, I disable it. Although sizewise it is q0mb better than Microsoft Edge in mine it can't print from the web since I updated. Opera is still No. 1."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For the last 24 hours chrome has been non stop crashing. It's infuriating not even to be able to open the app without it closing and giving me a ""chrome keeps stopping"". All I want to do is browse the internet and pay my bills when I'm away from my laptop. Honestly I have no idea why this is happening and I've done everything I can think of to make it stop but this issue is persistent. I hope this issue gets resolved. This is the reason for my low star rating."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some weird bug, it just doesn't update.i have tried everything from uninstalling, re updating, Force closing, wifi, mobile data everything but it just doesn't update anymore. Stuck with the old version. I use it and it works fine, I am just worried about the security updates that are important. Anyhow a solid browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever now. How could anyone think its a good idea to make tabs into grids and not give the user the option to disable it? It renders what should be a one handed motion into two handed with two ways to get to tabs. It is confusing and completely useless. I uninstalled the update and reverted back to the original. I'm debating on using another app entirely. Only an idiot would think grids are a good idea.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"With all the browsers out there, Chrome doesn't even come in 5th place. Being this is an original browser built in data Clara California, I would of wished it would and could do more. It's always freezing, it tracks your every move, and unfortunately sells off or gives away your private information (even though they tell you all this in small print). I would like to see google back at number 1 someday. Huh, maybe their waiting on the 49ers. This will be never then."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"We are the product and we are all freaking doomed. Google catalogs each and everything you do on your phone, every click, swipe and voice to text is tucked away in a digital archive with your name on it. Be bold. Try a competitor!! There are SO many smaller browsers out there with as many if not MORE FEATURES and BETTER SECURITY!. Some of which are even built using the same tech (chromium) SEE: Kiwi Browser and Microsoft Edge and thank me later"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most things are easy to do on Chrome. The space it takes up on my screen is excessive, however. The size of the browser texts is not proportionate with the area the unused space the browser occupies. I don't like the constant changes in my links to apps and sites. There is no place that I can find for instructions on how to use what I've got. Sometimes I'll accidently find something as I am going to do a totally unrelated task, and can't find my way back to it when the task is done."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tab Grid/Groups offers a miserable UX for users who leave tabs open for periodic reference. What used to be a tidy stack of quickly-scannable titles now requires tedious scrolling though a miniature of every open page, which is annoying and unhelpful. And the auto-grouping obscures info further. As of latest update, I can no longer turn this ""feature"" off. For me, this renders the browser UN-usable. Now I need to switch to a different browser on all my devices. How fun."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why I'm the world did they ruin tabbed browsing? Who thought a list style was better? And grouped tabs are gone as well? And I can't change it in the settings (at least that I could see). This feels like a step backwards, not forwards. At least give me the option to go back to the way it was before, because as is tabs are now useless."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The tab grouping that was introduced makes this almost unusable. There used to be a way to disable it, but the recent version still uses it, even with being set to disabled.

My most recent nightmare is the Android 12 update..my 2 week old phone is now a paperweight after being forced to install that garbage. This company needs to do better or go away . Just once I'd like to see something they create work as it's supposed to."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This once was a great app but now I seem to have more and more issues. This is highly upsetting and very shocked Google hasn't corrected the problems. My original rating was no doubt about it a 5 Star but now? Sorry have to rate this one as it affects me. I click on the up date button but it does absolutely nothing it circles around like it's getting the update but then it stops and the update icon is lit up so I hit it again - nothing - over and over just tossing my hands up.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ironically, the thing I liked most about Chrome over FF on Android was the file folder-like tab layout when looking at what I have open, so I really don't like this latest update. Grouping might be nice, but the interface is a huge con. *Updating to say that grouping ISN'T nice and appears to be the default when opening a new tab, which is truly annoying.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm so frustrated. Everyone doesn't have HOURS to devote to updates and figuring out how to use new/changed features. Also, how much memory do you think phones hold? Every update is larger and takes up more space. Every single place has their own app and regular websites don't work anymore. In my 30's and feel like I'm in my 60's. It's just too much for NO APPARENT reason."

After WEEKS of disabling tab grid layout and enabling tall ntv, MULTIPLE TIMES per day, EVERY day, sometimes twice within 30 minutes, I am finally done with Google chrome. No one wants 6 tabs taking up their whole screen when you could easily see 10 or more at the same time previously.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update, including phone updating to Android 12, Chrome has been acting crazy. Videos continue to play even after going into apps and force stopping it. Froze up a few times, opened again, and all my windows were gone, then all of a sudden, they all came back after opening and closing it a few times. Trying to full screen videos is a joke. Video gets pushed off to a corner and only see a tiny bit, but it's in full screen, so the rest of the screen is black."

In my case, if I take screenshot then that particular webpage freezes and the app only works after restarting it. It is very annoying and this browser also consumes a lot of resources!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app positive. We was excited to use our app. Chrome very smooth and useful for my drawing. Hope you can make more useful app like this!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just recently started using the seperate Google app for quick searches, which has done wonders in decluttering my browser tabs. However, I use a different browser and since the last update, it seems like we're forced to use the Chrome browser to use the ""open pages in Google app"" feature.. If this becomes a permanent restriction, I won't be using either. Freedom of choice and customization is a small asking in exchange for mining our data.."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst browser of all, you collect information but that is good for nothing when you literally can't ""verify"" its a persons account even if the password and other information is correct. You dare to act like you know nothing about the matching credentials but you collect the entire phones log and are on 24/7 in different apps. More than 100% of the time YOU GOOGLE APPS ARE ON BUT CANT STOP ANYONE FROM ACCESSING AN ACCOUNT EXCEPT THE OWNER. HORRIFYING."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is very slow and hangs up constantly l have to back out of it or receive a notification says chrome is not responding.sometimes the first thing that pops up when l open the up are porn images can you please work on that l dont really like when l am searching else. I do like the tabs but it is a little confusion at times.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For some reason the Update feature doesn't hold. I've hit Update in Google Play at least a dozen times over the past week only to have the message button reappear that a new update is available. Switching to the Bing browser which sucks because I've saved dozens of bookmarks over the years that I need in Chrome. Please fix I can't be the only one with this issue!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've used Chrome for year on pc and then mobile as it's my preferred browser. For some reason what used to be a small fast programme is going the way Microsoft products. Not all mobiles have lots of memory to utilise. The bigger the software is, it seems the slower they become. Please stop relying on people having the most up to date mobiles, it slows them down too."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is still a great and very fast browsing app, but the new layout is very irritating. There's now a huge bar at the bottom of the screen that i can't get rid of which often blocks lower parts of web pages that i can't get to. What was wrong with having a small drop down menu in the top corner? This feels like yet another app changing a perfectly good UI simply because they feel like they should, while completely disregarding the user experience."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure why everyone is complaining about the tab grids! I loved this feature on my google app, it allowed for such each access to find everything and sort all different things I was viewing into one. However, suddenly, I no longer have access to this feature so all of my grouped tabs were dispersed into the old style, flooding my tab feed and making it impossible to find the certain tabs I was looking for. Dissapointed but I hope they re-enable this feature again!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried to install Trichrome library with MDM permissions and all sorts of other stuff. I have it set to wifi update only yet it continuously tried. PlayStore and Google functionality on this phone has been completely side channeled and now there are insane permissions and a work account lockout on here. On my app page it says updated 9/24 and on the update/open page it says 9/30. I uninstalled it, but of course you cannot remove it even though I have another browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoyed using Chrome, especially with the compatibility with other devices and the way it synchronizes your information. However, the latest update to tab switching and opening is absolutely terrible and after many years of using Chrome they have forced me to use another browser. Really a shame, the other features are all amazing and the way tabs worked before was really nice and smooth."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app works realyvwell keeping data well and giving good update. They should make an ai it will fit well.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent tab grouping is terrible and a pain to use. Plus there's something completely wrong with the app. When typing in a page, I'll randomly get switched back to the previous webpage. The app constantly freezes. The highlight/select feature does not work. Often the cursor will disappear, and trying to type anything in a web page is so buggy. It was fine before, why did they make everything worse?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have accidentally closed all of my 79 tabs which are important. Please wish that there's an alternative to the undo option part. All of a sudden i was directed to 'close all tabs' when I was looking for 'open new tab'. I was in the middle of closing some incognito tabs, I saw the undo button too late. The moment I was going to undo it, the button disappeared. It's frustrating that only those viewed tabs can be recovered, why not all of it? I hope there's an alternative solution to this.üò≠"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Tab layout is straight up trash. Also, whenever I update chrome through play store, it always pauses at 97% and never gets to 100% completion no matter how many times I try. And this happens only when I update this app, not with others. Thank you for this; the person-in-charge neither knows what google users expect from new updates nor does he care about users' opinions, ultimately leaving me no choice but to never update this app."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Results are never what I typed, results are always only from nytimes or quora and if I deduct them from showing in my results I get only 2 irrelevant links; my results show a ton of videos- if I was searching vids, I woulda clicked the vid tab; tabs keep rearranging- just leave it alone. I know wher to find tabs if needed; images layout on pc is horrible and confusing for no reason; keeps changing the search I typed. Bing isn't great, but it's startin to be a whole lot better to use than google."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be good 3-4 years back. It was the best browser. But now things have changed. It frequently freezes. And most of all forced articles. It says ""based on your interest "". do hell with interest. It shows stuff that i never would care about. I remove them on an on. But still it keeps showing. If google doesn't solve it soon i might have to look for a better option. I liked the chrome when it was simple and powerful. I don't like it now because it has become over-smart."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update (08/23/2015). Videos don't play consistently, stock browser is better ---- (01/05/2014) ---- I liked having six pages opened all the time, because I would use certain sites allot such as my gyms schedule, or a project I was working on during my free time. Now it's one window only, I could leave a page up but I like to clean my open apps."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While by far it's the best search engine out there, I have some concerns for it. For one, the feature called ""Hey Google"" loves to turn on randomly in the middle of the night, which scares the living heck out of me. Secondly, the browser itself is poorly managed and/or secured. I find myself always getting annoying, scummy pop-ups talking about how I won a thousand dollars... On the contrary, the platform runs smoothly and it's AI interface is just amazing!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All of a sudden my chrome browser is going to a blank screen, nothing popping up and when I try to back out of it.... nothing happens. It freezers my phone, until I get the ""this app is not working"" pop up with the options to close or wait for the app to work. Really tired of it, every time I open it since yesterday morning! It's actually kinda odd that this was happening to me exactly one year ago, and I wrote a review on it back then. Is something going on??"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Yall really dropped the ball with this app--and not in a good way. I have tried all the suggestions offered to get this app to update, but weeks later I still can't update Chrome (you press it and it just continuously says ""pending"", so i tried the ""update all"", restarting my phone, uninstalling, etc.) Mozilla Firefox has been a life saver recently!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After months of struggling to use Chrome due to the inability to scroll up easily without refreshing the page, and finding no way to turn off the pull-to-refresh action, I have switched to another browser. I have a pixel XL which I love, and as soon as the developers change the app so that I can easily scroll up on articles and shopping sites without refreshing, I will return to Chrome. Otherwise it's too frustrating to use."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ' ve been having issues with chrome lately . It used to work perfectly . Now every time I go to search for something is like it has hiccup and completely skips the second and sometimes third word I type . The screen acts like it ' s going to another screen but it ' s the same one . Very annoying ! And I cannot update it won ' t let me it does nothing when I press update .
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"(Edited) Others shouldn't assume the general perspective. I actually really liked the grouping tabs layout and options. It makes things easier for me to identify which tabs are for my different purposes. I prefer this rather than the constant scrolling through card tabs to find just one tab I want to check out. I understand others don't like it, but it better not be removed permanently. Giving everyone the option to enable/disable is for the best. But stop assuming that no one likes it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Whenever I try to search anything via Google in my phone the screen goes black in first attempt. The screen work only in second attempt. This is time consuming and irritating
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not able to update Google Chrome and Android system webview. Rest every apps will get updated. I tried clearing cache of chrome, whole data chrome and disabling and enabling. But none of them worked. When I click on update, either of won't change anything or sometime a green line will circle the chrome sign for 4or 5 second and stop. Still don't get updated. While opening chrome, it also says to update chrome. Pls help. And Google is not responding Thanks"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This ""pull to refresh"" bug is ridiculously annoying. Fix it or I'm going elsewhere. I've lost crazy amounts of data/work because of this and it's been an issue for eons now. It's all over the web! And while you're at it, stop the ""spoken results"" for Google ""voice"" searches being the default option when updating chrome. I'm tired of turning it off. Why not just default to the user's last choice?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new tab grid layout and the tab groups. I cannot tell you how much I hate it. I hate it so much. For the love of God please give us back a way to disable it. It's a complete disaster. I never considered another browser until this moment, but after using this for a while I am seriously considering switching. The new UI is terrible in so many ways, it's a usability disaster. Please please give us an option to go back to the card swipe layout."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My system would not even allow it to update. It kept flipping out of update mode, but when checked, settings shows ""updates are available"". They can keep their updates. Now that there is an update, I say no! I will stick to Samsung which I like and to Duck Duck Go. Chrome and the Google alphabet take enough information from me and their app is for junk."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't even update, I've tried turning my phone off and back on and still nothing. That may be a blessing considering most of these comments. The most recent update prior to this one left me frustrated, everything is sluggish, and it randomly crashes often. I use only one device and I've got lots of work to do on it! I am so frustrated.

It's slow, I can't copy or save images when searching... Very disappointed üòû"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It has been my go to web browser for years. However the fact that you are forced to have grouped tabs these days makes it useless once you have a few tabs open as you can absolutely never find first the group then the tab you want. I end up closing all groups and manually navigating back.The old system worked great and the workaround when it was first introduced allowing you to go back to individual tabs was fine but they got rid of that work around I'm getting rid of chrome for android.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been a daily user of Google Chrome for many years. But for quite some weeks the app is showing in the update list and o tried to update it but it is not updating. I uninstalled and reinstalled it again but it is the same. Even though from today onwards it is shutting down automatically. Can you please fix this or else the option is to move to other browsers.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is misbehaving in a very unexpected way. Firstly it doesn't update in a singke tap. After a multiple try when it starts updating it takes longer than tha actual time even at a good internet speed. And after update it creates problems with phone's software.

It has however (not sure if the tabs function is causing this) pretty much rendered my Google page usage impossible.

I tried it and it worked and I hope it'll work for you guys as well. First, go to your phone's Settings>>Apps & Notifications (see all apps), you'll then look for Chrome and tap on it, after that, on the top-right corner of your screen, you'll see a menu (usually three vertical dots), tap on it and there's an option to uninstall updates, do it. I hope you find this helpful. Cheers üòâ"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Chrome is refreshing some of the pages automatically such as Google forms which is creating a loss of data and problem. This is the problem which I am facing from this month (September). I found this problem first time even after using this browser since 2016 October. But now I have to change my browser i hope Chrome will fix the issue soon. I then I will again.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything was fine, but people need the illusion of progress so you release updates, in which functionality doesnt seem important. Great idea! Lets destroy the way tabs used to work, not an improvement, but at least its an update! Rant complete. Chrome is awesome, but it was awesome a whole ago, and then it gets changed. Dont change what isnt broken people. Android OS could take this onboard too. Now we are all forced to look at horrid orange in text messages... for what!? Ok rant actually complete."

I can't update it, I can't uninstall it from my phone, I don't like it, the worst kind of bloatware: Slow. ----- I hate the new appearance and the fact that it's heavier every time I update it. If it continues like this I will freeze the hell out of it and never use it again. Going Firefox or Dolphin."

I really think that grid option really helps me to organize my tabs and to find what site I left off and everything, knowing that you just disabled it and now everything comes back to the way it was before... I was just dissapointed and devastated."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a 5 star app but the whole group tab thing is so obnoxious and unhelpful. It's slow and clumsy to just switch tabs now and It's buggy, too! The amount of times that awkward tab selection bar at the bottom of the screen appears and then refuses to disappear is unreasonable. It stays up even if you fullscreen something else on the site you're on. And scrolling down doesn't always work, either. Worst part is there's no way to turn this ""feature"" off.

Since it was not updating I deleted all of its existing updates so that I can start updating it from scratch. But even like that it does not allow me to update. And this happens from a long back."

Unfortunately, I lose dark mode, but its a small price to pay for stability. The first thing I tried was turning off sync and clearing cache and data but none of that works. The problem is something in the app itself."

I'd rather use something else less stalky and its one less google product on my phone. Good riddens. Besides i think phone wise Firefox seems to be more reliable with videos playing. I think google tried to give this app every permission they have."

Searched online for a fix, no luck. The response suggesting help on how to open Play to automatic updates, totally irrelevant. Tried uninstalling Chrome and re-installing, it won't uninstall.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It has recently started freezing up quite a lot, I couldn't even open it most of the times due to the lag. When I do manage to open it and search something, I have a 20 percent chance of the experience being pleasant and the app doing what I actually want. It was my go to browser bit it just isn't cutting it anymore. Tl;DR - lags wayyyy too much and is slow. Sometimes doesn't even start."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"latest improvement was to bring tab selector from top right to bottom right corner. which makes sense for mobile phones since you are using the phone by holding it upside up, hands at the lower corner(s). but then why not bring tab close x also to the bottom? i mean i can chose from folders down, comfortably, but if i want to close them, have to ""reach"" up again. I think these two functions belong together (their position on the screen). don't you think? cheers (73.0.3683.75, on Android Pie)"

When I noticed the setting was grayed out, I naturally assumed the Google app was the cause and uninstalled the latest update. The problem persisted, so I updated Google app and uninstalled the Chrome update. DING, DING, DING!!!! Problem solved. For now, I have disabled the Chrome auto-update. Please fix this!"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think it's ridiculous that it updates every other week and when it does it claims to require another extra 20-something worth of my memory.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update has completely broken the update installer. I even tried uninstalling updates and starting from fresh to get it to work with no luck. Now it won't update at all, so the version I have is even older. Kind of frustrating when I was just explaining to some co-workers how important it is to keep your apps up to date."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As many other reviews have stated, current version is incredibly buggy. Freezes randomly on startup, takes multiple tries to not just get a blank screen, and sometimes slows entire phone to a halt. Fix the current version to being at least as good as it was, and my review will change. Until then, everyone is better off using another browser app."

Thoroughly disappointed in what was a great platform."

I have canceled the auto update, deactivated it, disabled it, uninstalled it no less than a half dozen times in the first week of owning my new S70 phone. I have flagged it as inappropriate multiple times, asking for it to be removed, but to no avail. If I wanted it on my phone, I'd stop uninstalling it. Repair this app so that the uninstalle button works, and doesn't allow it to install itself again. This app would get zero stars, but you have to give it 1."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was perfectly happy with this app until after a recent update it stopped using mobile data- which obviously takes away most of its functionality when out and about. I've worked through the (very) limited help google gives it's users, with no results. Now left with the final resort, which is to uninstall all updates and go back to the factory installed version- Which still works perfectly, though obviously without some useful features. Updates are supposed to improve things Google!"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best browser yet. Fast, efficient and secure. It's by Google, so you have peace of mind that you have the best there is. Excellent for synchronising bookmarks and passwords securely via your smartphone and chromebook, which need to be linked first. It also has many security features built in to make sure you stay protected and safe whilst browsing or shopping online. Better for online shopping when using the Google Pay application for extra security, privacy and of course, peace of mind."

One of the things that really bothers me is that whenever a website prompts you to use your device current location you're not able to select BLOCK or ALLOW. Even if you try to select ALLOW, nothing will happen. At first I thought my screen was defective but then I realized I was only the app that wasn't working properly and the only way to get rid of the prompt window is to press the go back key.

Every time I open a web page, or press a link, the page crashes after a few seconds and Chrome button shows.. Sometimes when I open the tab, the web page is seen in a separate window, and one can open it again, but the page again crashes in a few seconds. Considering the last uodate I received was on 7 Dec, it's barely 2 weeks old andnow am facing this issue without help. Maybe it's time to look at other search engines, till it's corrected."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new tab layout with this latest update!!! The windowpane view is much harder to scroll through and a lot easier to accidentally close tabs you want to keep open. The first time I used it I lost all the tabs I was keeping. I also really hate they way they are grouping tabs and the extra box that appears when tabs are automatically grouped together. At minimum, there should be a way to separate them if you don't want them auto grouped together or a setting where you can turn that off."

I dont appreciate it one iota. This happens even if I use a different browser."

There is nothing efficient about completely changing where things are located when people were familiar with these locations for yeara.
