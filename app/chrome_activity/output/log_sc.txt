Usually this app is good, but from last two or three weeks,the app is crashing continuously.

So disappointing... I have been a faithful Chrome user for years. When I installed the most recent update 7 to 10 days ago, Chrome started crashing on me and hasn't stopped crashing. I launch the browser and about 10 seconds later, the browser just shuts down. I then receive receive a notification stating the app isnt responding and the option to Close App, Wait for App or Leave Feedback. My biggest frustration is that all of my bookmarks and passwords are in Chrome, but when the browser crashes every 7 to 10 seconds, it can be challenging to navigate into your data in that small window of time. Now I have to use my Samsung browser or find another app.

Note the many 1 star reviews. I HATE that my preference to manually update was apparently over ridden and that I now am forced to use this now crappy looking app. It would be ok if if the update was an improvement. It isn't. It looks horrible and is cumbersome to navigate: the look and feel are awkward and inelegant. And, there's no easily apparent way to reset to manual update preference. I suppose that's because the way the app looks and works and feels is now so crappy, many would elect to revert to an earlier version. The inability to do so forces us to work with what is.

This app is slow and 50% of the time I open it, it freezes on a blank grey page and wont go any further until I completely close out of it and try again. It happened enough that I just uninstalled it completely and will look for a new search engine. I was patient for about a month to see if updates would fix it, but it's just a waste of time.

The tabs for my saved open pages is HORRIBLE. The tabs only show about 10 letters of the page. Half the tabs show no pictures. So it is a guessing game as to what those pages are. Who ever designed this needs to be fired. Seriously. Please bring back the list. Until you do I am personally going to stop using the chrome browser and I will check back from time to time to see if this has been fixed.

As per another review, the latest version loses text (on Moto G54 - Android 13) - clearing cache, disabling/enabling, forcing stop sometimes resolves for a short time, then text goes again across search results and websites. Some images appear normally, some don't. Reverting back solves the issue.

I'm done with chrome. Search results are not relevant. It's a major issue, that makes the web search unusable. Issue is even more severe on mobile. Not relevant searh results mean top 10 results on other languages other than search query. I've been sending multiple feedbacks, with no results. Didn't have this issue ever on edge and bing

You're seriously incapable of not making stupid changes, aren't you? What is with the change to the tabs!? It looks awful and the folder system is so clumsy and frustrating when I don't want it! I still hate the change to the pop-up window that appears when you tap and hold a URL link on a page. I still hate how the Search page function scrolls through the page to get to each result. On long pages it takes too long for the app to scroll to each one and it's annoying to wait for it.

Trash update. Every time open the app it went black. After the re-sent update this app is even going worse.

I enjoy the app but since the recent update: words have been disappearing - temporarily fixed by disabling the app in settings, the top of the page starts glitching when scrolling, the page continues to refresh when searching, images and words have been clipping into each other, and the app will start flipping between light and dark mode for no reason.

App missing since update, missing from homescreen. A search of my phone finds it but I cannot drag and drop it anywhere. It disappeared from my google folder. Can someone help?

One of the most inconsistent apps I've ever used. Stop changing stuff just for the sake of pushing out an update. The duet and home has been changing since it's dawn and just when we get familiar and comfortable with one version, you guys change it all of a sudden. This is the third cycle of change that I'm experiencing. It's probably time to stop using chrome now.

Nonsense and lot of bugs in this browser, so please, don't default your browser, page unresponsive showing again and again in my laptop.

With the new update, I hate one thing. When I see movies, I see the 3-button navigation bar (back, home, task manager) appearing in a fullscreen. This is frustrating, and very annoying. Nobody wanna see this bar while watching movie. HDVID, is a perfect example of that. I will send screen to you, so you can understand what I mean.

Open up Chrome and start typing in a URL wish to go to. Chrome will then completely cancel that and minimise my keyboard to tell me l'm now "viewing live page". It's very frustrating as it's happening nearly everytime l'm opening chrome. Think I'll have to switch to Firefox.

Something happened to me but I don't know how to explain it but it's annoying, I open several pages, every tab I open it creates a tab for the page. But recently, when I close a tab, the page remains as if it is a tab, not a page, the tile looks as if it is a tab, which should automatically revert to normal page, please fix this

I'm still investigating this version of Chrome - so far it's working just fine and all of the "new features" I've encountered are attributible to Samsung and/or Google.

This update has totally messed up my web searches. I can reach a url site but no info appears and the site is unusable as interactive. Update: Google reply only suggestion was to make sure I'm connected to the Internet. I find that insulting. Of course I was Internet connected. The problem is not with my abilities but with the Google update. There is def something wrong with it. I uninstalled the latest version and now my searches work.

Recently Google has pushed through several changes that have soured my experience with the browser. First, there was google lens (not as good as the original image search feature and frequently buggy). And now there is AI overview. I don't want AI search results shoved in my face when I go onto google and I want the option to opt-out of them. If this doesn't change, then I'll be looking for another internet browser since it's clear Google thinks it knows best and doesn't want to give me choices.
