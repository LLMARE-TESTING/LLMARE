It's all for sale and it all goes through the algorithm. They cemented themselves in our lives, undressed us and sold the pictures to the highest bidder. The ads, the bad search results, no privacy.

Overreliance on Google ecosystem. No built-in VPN. Having the password manager built into the browser poses a grave security threat.

The only downside to it is that your phone gets hot on some of the news sites it recommends because there's no adblock. They have so many ads sometimes I'll just share the page with Samsung browser on my moto razr, so I can use adblock and minimize a lot of the content on the screen. Plus save the battery. Would've given it 5 stars if they'd offer some kind of adblocking like they used to."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Chrome takes up too much RAM; Google: can't uninstall apps you don't need. Chrome search gives limited results. Update: Chrome & Google apps use so much memory RAM that there's not enough left to operate other apps; one uses about 130MB more RAM than my other search engine even BEFORE it's in use. Constantly clearing both caches to run other apps. Needs a major overhaul.

Can you please stop 'experimenting' and let me control my browser the way I like? I want the adress bar on the bottom. I want to get rid of the recently closed tabs tiles in the homepage. I literally have no control over the browser. Good thing I can use something else shame though since I'd have liked to use Android's default browser instead.

I have only been left with non-Chrome ones so it must be Chrome that's the issue. OK, I could re-install them you might say, but the update also is not allowing me to shortcut to a specific page as it did previously, only allowing me to shortcut the top level on the site. As an example, I go to BBC co.uk/sport/football and when trying to add this to my Homepage, it will only allow BBC co.uk."

I mean, seriously, I know you can't test every website, but at least test your own products. I'm plad they are probably going to be split up, because they have been forcing horrible changes, never fixing bugs, never providing any customer support or real wayl to contact them for too long. Even their response on here is canned garbage that has nothing to do with what a user stated."

It's simply not worth my time, the search results are mostly unrelated to what I have searched for, with sponsored websites popping up everywhere.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The reason they put the AI results at the top is because they knew that nobody would go out of their way to use it (because it's useless) The reason I'm giving it 1 star is because of the AI feature and nothing else.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After some recent updates I have noticed that the search bar disappears when i scroll down and surprisingly reappears when I scroll up despite being at the top of the page. But even after disappearing it is fully functional. Another problem I have is, when using the chrome widget from the home screen to search it always initiates the search in a new tab which means the default 1 tab which is open for search doesn't get used and just sits there. Its a nit pick sure but still, its kinda annoying."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8/17/24 update please explain to me how I can turn on my phone and never go on this app and within 1 hour you have used 122 MB of data?!!! I hate this app but it's pre-installed on my phone just like everything else Google related. Talk about a monopoly! I even went as far as disabling it and putting in another browser and it worked well for 2 weeks somehow I think the Google apps that were left figured out a way to screw that up. Google is a data hog and you run down my battery in the process.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Thanks for choosing Chrome! This release includes stability and performance improvements. Google didn't give details information about updates they always told this message above mentioned. Long screen shot features don't worked since the features added to till now.

When Microsoft released the Edge browser I was one of many that took so little notice of that it was pointless to even have an option. I don't think like that anymore. So for the 1st 25yr Edge is now the no1 browzer by quite some distance. The addition of chatgpt has changed everything and they hv left Google in the dust."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,UPDATE: The most recent updates to the app have made it unstable. I have confirmed this multiple times. The app stops responding for a moment while the settings section is accessed every time after clearing cache and data. Forcing the app to stop does not help things either. It is just slower now. I don't see any improvements made to the app recently either that make the obvious slow down even worth it either. Maybe more headlines crammed onto the google headlines are the reason? Not sure.

Chrome flips that onto its head and dedicates the same amount of RAM to each tab. Your browsing is faster, but your computer's performance suffers. Then there is the plethora of security issues and website tracking that Chrome subjects its users to. Chrome is meant to be free from hackers tracking cookies. The only reason I gave this app two stars is because it provides the original web version of Google Apps."

A description of the issues would be over 500 characters, another post perhaps? Hopefully, (Timothy Howie)"

I'm tired of the stupid ""Preview"" mode that makes it take a few seconds before ""Viewing Live Page"". Cleared cache/data (including Google data), uninstalled/reinstalled, made sure that preloads are set to ""standard"", tried temporarily unexpiring M110 flags (no longer exists) to disable ""Tab Hover Cards"", Disable Paint Preview Mode no longer worksb it's an annoying, useless (much like the stupid tab groups), and possibly dangerous feature."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've always used Chrome. never an issue whatsoever until this last update. now running absolutely horrible. it refreshes pages if you have to switch back and forth between tabs and you're typing something or it completely refuses to load any web pages like at all. I did start checking set as desktop site and it would bring up the website I don't know really weird however of course in that mode it's absolutely horrible to navigate on a phone
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is it that everytime I update my chrome it's doesn't work it hard been three week now and I've updated it again today but it won't open , normally when I update it like today on Saturday it takes a week to work something goes for as long as two weeks depending on how long I've stayed without updating and it's not the first time this has happened ,the same thing used to happen with my older phone Samsung J4 later bought another phone Infinix XOS and after a while the same thing is happening ."

Tried all the help suggestions. Google Play services won't even update on new phone. Plus most Google apps get killed and I have to start over. It's non-stop. Google if you're going to monopolize on most devices and make your apps mandatory to use basic functions then offer Bug-Free OS and App.. I can't update this app. What's the issue Google? It's been over 6 months."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thoroughly enjoy this search engine or whatever it's correct terminology is, I am not a Techy,👩‍💻💻however compared to other options I think Chrome has the least ad intrusions, and the ones they do display they at least attempt to make them along the lines of points of interest that the history sees that you enjoy. Thank you!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I can't switch tabs to check if I'm spelling something right or forgot what I was typing midsearch! The text disappears when you go to look at your other tabs. This is insanely frustrating and needs to be fixed. I use that functionality constantly. The search bar needs to stop refreshing and erasing what I typed when I navigate to a different tab or click to see my open tabs!

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Would have given a five stars up until the last update. I don't think I should have given as many stars as I have but... Since then I get annoying ads popping up every time I click on something. Trying to see the almost invisible x or wait for the countdown to be able to x out is ridiculous especially when you have to click on something right after and it creates another ad. I suppose if nothing else I've cut down on my phone time. 🙄
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is a useless browser you can't even copy and paste since the new update it used to be user friendly but now it's impossible to use back in the days when tap on images it used show latest where you can tap to see what's new but now it just gives alot of old stuff and in between the images you must look for what is new in between the old images what type browser is this what were the developers thinking by realising such update this is not good at all im very disappointed.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of extension support in the mobile version of Google Chrome. Despite being deeply entrenched in Google's ecosystem, this glaring omission is a deal breaker for me. Extensions are vital for a tailored browsing experience, offering everything from enhanced security to ad-blocking capabilities. On desktop, they empower users and enhance productivity, but on mobile, we're left with a bare-bones experience that doesn’t meet the needs of advanced users."

When you download something, it keeps a download window thing open and shows it's still trying indefinitely to download it, even though it's already done..

I had cleared data and cache from in the Chrome browser but you also have to clear it from the app section on your phone settings menu. crashes less often but still crashes. I downloaded opera and it is working great! I suggest any other browser still. What I difference! Never going back
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Surprisingly bad app for such a massive company. Tabs will randomly close without permission, the entire app crashes randomly, the updates they made to incognito mode have worsened it significantly and made it much more frustrating to use. It seems like with every update the app gets worse. Just tried to add an account to browse on, went through the whole process that Google drags out a ton to sign in, then the account just wasn't added to my device at all. Super buggy"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chrome always sends bugs to my phone. The notifications are back to back of bugs. They are making my phone run slower.

My phone is siiick with bugs from chrome. Yall need to fix this immediately.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've never seen a big deal on my phone from the WiFi and it says I have a pretty good signal on my phone from Walmart but I never left the store to see if it was a little glitch but it's still a little hard to find out but I think it's a lot of stuff that is going through the app chrome Internet and it should not be in the state of my phone not working properly for the free WiFi at Walmart but it's still not working right so it should have been fixed by now.. does that make sense..

My phone isn't the problem. It's the app. Samsung makes updates firmware as often as they could, fixing their issues- the updates fixed most of my issues with my phone ,So I know it isn't my phone. Your app glitches my phone. I can't search anything or do anything. Most of the time I have to use my tablet to search now. Thanks for that."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You can't play video while on the call. Absolutely horrible experience of tabbed browsing. New continue browsing pane is irritating.

I've tried using other search engines but, they direct me from one link to another and before I know it I have spent an hour of my life that I'll never get back looking for, for example, a full proof meatloaf recipe when Google Chrome gets me to one in less than a minutes time.

When I travel abroad, I generally want search results from my resident country only."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Several times a day I have had to restart my phone to be able to use anything I've saved in my chrome. It will show my saved username/password but won't let me click on it to use it. Also happens with my saved cards. Shows them but can't click on them. Started right after the update. Fix it!!!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The only problem is that all the versions of chrome have a memory server problem and no option to disable it in mobile devices and all chrome's version don't remember the previous page if you've left chrome go somewhere else and come back to chrome instead of showing you the page which you left but it reloads and take you back to the home page of that site. I don't know if this is just because my device has a low RAM but opera mini works perfect on this issue I have described on my device.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's frustrating how when I download a big important file, the download crashes when I've been waiting at the download page for so long. It also keeps saying 'Chrome is not responding' every once in a while even though I didn't put any restrictions on how Chrome runs. And also, most downloads are INCREDIBLY SLOW! Like god dang when I'm downloading a few megabytes of files it takes like 15 mins. If this is fast for y'all it really shows the slowness when downloading big files."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After updating the app yesterday, the bookmark function is no longer user-friendly that the web page is not saved in the bookmark folder as it used to be.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Looking things up on this app is genuinely getting infuriating , i was looking for some stuff locally and found nothing.Until i ended up telling one of my friends who searched it up exactly as i typed it and found it within the top results .It used to be a good app but this is just getting frustrating to use. Other than that it works fine with password saves and everything but when your main feature is being a search engine and being bad at searching then i really i dont know how to justify it"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scrolling tabs is basically useless now: scroll one row and everything temporarily freezes. Bookmarks are now a mess of unnecessary steps and should be restored. Changing things just to change them is a pointless waste of time, especially when something worked before and has now become cumbersome and annoying. Do better."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It gets the job done, but only barely. It's slower than the competition. It doesnt support any extensions. The whole goal of this browser is to sell out the user and spy on the user's browsing habits for the purposes of lining Google's advertising pockets. It sucks that it can't be uninstalled. Give Firefox a try instead."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bug or something ?? Every time I go to search anything it shows results but clicking on anything goes straight to a black blank screen. I restarted my phone, cleared cache, etc nothig works and I can't search nothing for nothing. No YouTube videos or anything. It's not just chrome it's Google all together. I can't do anything.

This update has a lot of problems. 1😡 As a blogger, you can't upload pictures to your blog again using this app. I have to resort to other app to do that which is taking a lot of space. 2😡 Bookmarks are a mess now. I don't know why this app itself chooses a bookmark folder for you when you've set to something else yourself. 3😡 Some pages don't load well. You'll see only pictures but not texts"

I've always been able to save my Google account passwords to my device, turn off sync / sign out of my Google account, and my passwords were still in password manager. It's like Google is trying to force me to stay signed in with sync on! This is a major privacy concern. What is going on?"

Now there's another update today which I still have not yet updated but says that it Chrome is up to date 🤥.... Stability and performance improvements 🤔 .. I think the developers need stability and performance improvements. Every Google app update is horrible. Transparency and more information would be great as to what would be awesome...

I wasted an hour trying to explain to my father where his files were, to try and share It in another app, to never find It. Chrome used to be my favorite Browser for the past 18 years.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand why you would put ""block pop-ups"" as an option when it does not block any at all in reality. And then it proudly says ""2 pop-ups blocked"". It's so funny like the app is trying to lie to itself. Please do better, Chrome team. How many years has it been since you have this feature? And it's completely useless. You might as well just remove it."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Two potential features that Google could consider implementing in Chrome for Android are: 1) An ad-blocking extension to enhance user experience and reduce distractions while browsing. 2) An improved reading mode layout to provide a more comfortable and visually appealing reading experience. By implementing these features, Google can demonstrate its commitment to user satisfaction and provide a more seamless browsing experience for its mobile users."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"2022: After so many years I'm disappointed with Chrome. Why is the search bar at the top? Why must you press the menu button for every action except the home button, and open pages? Why not make it more of a toolbar with share, bookmarks, refresh, back or forward, etc? There's nothing convenient about this app anymore with so much competition..........2024: Please bring the toolbar to the bottom, or at least give us the option to do it. My phone is large."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,CLEARING HISTORY ≠ CLOSING THE TABS why can't y'all release an update that actually improves the app? Nobody asked for these features!!! And when it doesn't close the tab it moves it to a completely different spot and you have to scroll through the tabs. Not the experience you should have for being such a popular and well established browser. Goodbye default browser I will use something better.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Last update deleted all chrome shortcuts on my home page. Hitting the back key closes the tab instead of just going back in the tab.

Can't even fully uninstall it. PS: if I have to read stuff to make it not get into the way of using software on purpose, some assumption of the design team is wrong. There should be an option to uninstall it or at least make sure it's not annoying me by popping up out of nowhere. Even NCSA Mosaic did that better."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usually love Chrome, but the past couple weeks it crashes more often than it works, and loading pages takes sometimes literally over a minute. Just bought a brand new phone two months ago, so I know it's not the phone's processor because if nothing else, other apps would be affected by the slowness. I have already cleared the cache."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"[Shortened MORE] Tell me how you can make ANY Google website repeatedly refresh to the point where I couldn't click anything on it? As a web browser, it is still decent, but as a search engine, it had failed miserably! Edit 1: I tried to clear ALL data, uninstall and reinstall updates, etc., still no fix to this! Edit 2: These intrusive daily updates are absolutely useless! If y'all would have addressed and worked on the main problems at hand, this would have not changed from two stars to one."

First, in app ""downloading/downloaded file"" pop up was badly on my nerves specially when downloading multiple files. Second, a non-stop popup that demands force stop and saying app is not working. i did everything to solve it and at last a factory reset but problem wasnt solved. there are some other problems but i have only 500 characters so cant write them! Goodbye annoying app :)))"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So if you force an app on us please at least have the dam option to move the tool bar to the bottom. I mean come on the most simple thing that phone users want and you can't even manage that! ""Use chrome, it's amazing!"" Just don't ask if you can move the tool bar to the bottom, because it apparently too hard for Google to do! Maybe you could ask your AI to sort it for you! Ridiculous not having that option."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent ..easy to use. We can save documents and browse it again anytime! Downloading apps (which are not available in playstore) makes it easier to access useful apps needed for our day to day use. I like how we can hide our history and restore it as well. Overall excellent app and user friendly! Deserve full stars rating.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You need to add an option to opt out of AI. The AI generated results spread misinformation and I don't like my data being used for something I'm ethically opposed to. I'm going to have to switch search engines. I find this wholly unacceptable. Edit: I've now switched to DuckDuckGo and enjoy it so much better. The sheer amount of harmful misinformation parroted by Google's AI is alarming.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"""Thanks for installing Chrome!"" - well Google I didn't. Instead it has been forced upon me as an Android system app, which can not be uninstalled. If Microsoft did this on a PC, Google would be up in arms! I have rated the app 3 stars simple because Microsoft Edge, which I chose to install, uses the same rendering engine."

Since the last update whenever I make a bookmark on the adroid chrome app it will only save to the mobile bookmark folder and no longer remembers/saves to the last used filder so it's now a headache to organize my bookmarks. Still no fix for this after an entire month!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Needs an exit button that wipes out all tabs. Not only that, when I enabled chrome to check if you decided to add an exit button, you screwed up my default apps. I usually can open a link from YouTube but after disabling chrome now it doesn't recognize my current default app. Plus having to write this review with your Gboard was frustrating."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic internet browser with regular updates and bugfixes or so they say ""Thanks for choosing Chrome! This release includes stability and performance improvements."" But, why not use the ""What's New"" section to tell the user! If Google cannot be bothered, how can we expect other developers to do so! Down to 3*s. And another Update without either a developer response nor an informative 'What's New' post. Down to 2*s. And another who knows what update and still no response - lost another '*'.."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the updated Chrome generated by AI do to the fact it's simple to adjust setting the way you choose to and still be able to access your browsing . And it stays the same way as you put it when you return unlike others change settings back without your knowledge an not everything is in order ...

This browser really sucks, i lost all my ongoing work on those unretrivable tabs. I think i better change to another browser to avoid all this loss."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Besides the day to day discovery of vulnerabilities the app is probably the best browser out there but with everything good there's always the bad and it's used as a tool for bad actors /idiots to often other wise it's reliable and always doing something new with features that we ask for and it doesn't get the credit it does deserve along with everyone working in the chromium world. So thanks for a reliable and dependable browser.

McAfee has also tried but they cannot get rid of them. I want them off, it is not my choice. They are coming from Google on my Samsun phone. NOT FAIR PUSHING ADS IN OUR FACE."

Privacy? What privacy? Feels like Google is watching my every move and bombarding me with targeted ads. Crashes more often than a teenager's car on prom night. Lost important work because Chrome decided to take a permanent vacation. Look elsewhere if you value your battery life and sanity! There are faster, more efficient browsers out there."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome works well most of the time. But when there's a problem, that is when it falls over. I have at least 2 or 3 problems. Eg.

I get no answers from your support!! How can I chat with a real person?"

Then, I have to go to ""History"" and mark all the tabs I want back,1 by 1 at the correct timing (probably the latest) which is so annoying! Bring back session restore!

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the browser, but I don't like that the tab count shows the number of all the tabs open even if they are in groups. I liked it when the tab count told you how many groups and non-grouped tabs you have open. I also hate the constant UI changes, recently they made it so that your bookmarks and the results from what you typed in the URL/Search bar at the top of the tab to have a bubble shape instead of looking like a list which was more clean and simple in my opinion."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This browser has the most ads I've ever seen in any browser. At times I only have about 20% of my screen because of ads that I can look through. Any browser that takes up more than 10% of your screen for and is not worth my time. It's the Chrome browser not my phone is hadnot been hijacked so don't try to post a link about that. Use your own browser for 10 and you will see.

I have been using it for years and it has never once let me down and it has always found the information I was looking for and has always given
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nearly unusable. Every single search on Chrome brings up a 'Something went wrong' message. Same story every time for the last two months. Browser is slow to load and each time there are updates the Discovery feed magically turns itself back on. Enough to make me go screaming back to Apple.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can find anything out about everything I want to know about.Google Chrome is great. It very well with different types of filing applications and makes file sharing a snap.I'm not clear as to this app having paid stickers but I'll bet the find out what apps do. Gboard has them for free. This app does not have voice messaging but it does have voice access so you can speak to your Gboard another useful tool from Google that can easily make telling stories and sending text messages with emojis.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They keep changing the interface and making you rememorize where something is at for no reason.

I am no longer interested in wasting time with Google's pathetic clunky changes. I only require security updates to the last version that operated in a 70% acceptable manner. Please advise on security patch updates without any of the ridiculous & ruinous additional features.

And this is clearly a defect in chrome. It worked before the update! What I will do if this isn't fixed promptly is switch to some other browser and I'm not likely to use Chrome again. UPDATE: apparently google decided that a forced reboot of my phone was necessary. It happened overnight and now Chrome looks different but it still has the rendering Bug. A suggestion to Google... fire the chrome testers & developers, and roll back everyone to the previous version. Because a bug like this should have never been released."

I had originally used flags in order to go back to the original layout but that is no longer an option so I'm here. This layout is TERRIBLE for those that have a hard time focusing when their screen is cluttered and that's exactly what it is, cluttered. At least give us the option to return back to the original layout. I will not be allowing chrome to update automatically from now on."

The tab grouping feature is idiotic at best!

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New interface sucks. It used be color coded for each webpage and I could have a black or dark gray background for use at night or in a dark room. And when you would open the tab that displayed all your current open webpages they were splayed out like a deck of cards in a vertical fashion. The color coded address bars on each individual page over a dark background made it very easy to spot the page you wanted and select it. Not to mention it was little strain on your eyes. Now white toolbars over white background makes everything look like one sold page and is completely blinding even with brightest down and blue light opacity filter on. Also you've got to think that a brighter screen consumes more batter power thus draining an already short battery life even faster! Terrible update. Hate it hate it hate it. Well done Google!

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall Chrome is an innovative browser in multiple ways, pushing also into new grounds for what mobile apps are capable of being. Some suggestions: 1. The recent update with tab groups highlights the need for a short-cut (e.g. via a menu entry by the vertical ellipsis ⋮ button). The reason is that it takes too long time to render the ""all the tabs"" preview screen (tens of seconds in case too many tabs opened). The cumulative effect that I personally observe is that more and more tabs gets opened and remain open, further bringing a hesitation and avoidance to open the whole app to begin with. 2. Opening a new tab sometimes opens the tab in the middle of all the existing tabs. This random behavior is annoying. I think the tab should (by default) be opened as the rightmost tab."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: Hate the new tabs. It makes browsing so much slower. Removing tabs from groups doesn't always work. Chrome is making default decisions about when and what to group, which isn't helpful. It's buggy and you can't disable it. Old review: It's a great browser, however when you type in an address our a search term, the word selection on the keyboard doesn't pop up. You also can't default desktop websites for large tablets."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's rapidly became the worst browser on Android. The amount of ads is just straight up ridiculous, and no way to block them. It's missing most of the features of other browsers and is slower and laggy due to an all-out assault with ads and pop-ups. Google seem to be hellbent on destroying themselves, as Google search is also now almost useless as all search results are ads. And don't even get me started on the mess they've made of YouTube. Google are incompetent."

But if you go back to old tabs the page looks like it reloads but it isn't a reload. I know this is probably a function to of chrome but it can confuse people into thinking it is reloading automatically. Update in Nov 2018: there should be a confirmation for closing all tabs
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The grid layout isn't terrible. DuckDuckGo has a similar layout style, and I like it. The issue is only allowing links to be opened into a new tab in a group. It makes switching to that new tab a chore with the additional unnecessary interactions. Also moving the new tab button on the tab switcher page to the top left is inconvenient for one-handed use. DDGo has all of its buttons for new tab, clear data, and drop-down menu in the top right, which is significantly easier to use one-handed."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Similar to the desktop browser there's not much to configure. Just works as you would expect. However, no support for Ad Blocker (or any extensions at all) which results in slow rendering, laggy scrolling and overall reduced usability, caused by excessive use of ads on mobile web pages.

No one wants this, yet they push it every update, and now they've removed the option to disable it entirely. - Also apparently the email for google is no longer being monitored... Original review: Lately has been terrible. These last few updates have created multiple issues. Lag, freezing, and crashing. It used to be great, but it just keeps going in the wrong direction after every each update months later."

Seems to be the same problem as before this last update. It doesn't seem to operate with Android System Web View. Both apps are behaving the same way as before. Then I had the option of disabling Chrome to get Web View to work. Not with this version and the one before, etc., etc. Maybe next year. Not a word from developers. Sucks really"

Update: Ive now found that with the latest update, I can hardly load any pages, even the simplest, and chrome often says I have no connection. When a page does load, I cannot interact with it at all. Until an update is released fixing this I'll have to use another browser, which is unfortunate because Chrome has all my bookmarks and passwords, which normally would mean easily signing into sites. I hope they fix the app soon."

Other apps that require internet working just fine at the same time."

Then came those horrible updates, every update that came made Chrome worse and worse to use. Sometimes my Samsung Galaxy keyboard doesn't type in the words on this browser and other times Chrome just crashes completely. I have to restart the app multiple times and reset my phone too. Sometimes Chrome freezes for no reason and I am not able to click anything. I might be switching to another search browser if these issues keep getting worse."

SUGGESTION: Why not have the 'save-to' bookmark folders list collapsed - like when you 'open from' your bookmark list. It would make it so much easier to use!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dear Google, I have never thought I would write a review. But to honest, the latest update is the worst that I must say: 1. The switching tab looks old-fashioned with blue boxes (blue, really?). Please bring back the modern design as before. 2. When there are many browsers, applications to switch to, normally, the option is at the bottom with delegant design, but now, it's right in the middle with ugly interface."

After it was done updating, the ""open"" button didn't give me access to go back into google. But, I still have a problem going into websites. Please, fix this, there are many complainings."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New tab groups are awful. Having tiny icons at the bottom of the page does not benefit you in any way, since you can't see basically anything about the pages without going to them, where you had a good preview of all your tabs before just 1 click away. The tiny X's also make them harder to close, and closing ad popup pages are even more annoying now. Just give us an option to go back to the old way and let people that never clean up their tabs use the new system."

Especially if these features are not mentioned in the 'what's new' list."

This is Chrome. Made by Google software engineers; supposedly some of the most intelligent designers in the field. How in the hell can you guys allow such an obtuse design flaw exist for years on end? I truly want to know."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm having issues updating my Google Chrome. I've tried uninstalling it, but it's not responding. This is so frustrating as Google Chrome is my default browser. I can't do anything. It's been a week. I sent a mail to support, but I can't resolve the issues even with their suggestions. Am I the only one having this particular problem? I will appreciate the support team to resolve this on their end if possible as the update available, I can't seem to get it done from my end. Please, kindly help."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,In addition to all the previous issues that make this one of the worst browsers for android we now have the disappearance of the home button and also very poorly designed and lengthier process to open new tabs now. Chrome is no longer my default browser setting on any of my devices and its amazing how much faster i can find what I'm looking for.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is only getting worse day by day. While other browsers are leaning more and more into one-hand UI, chrome is getting more difficult to use on avarage screen phones. Devs disabled the option to move the search and menü to the bottom of the screen, introduced tab groups that creates a group automatically (that is very annoying) and now it went to ""list view"" in opened tabs, so its only text with icons. The worst of all, is that there isn't any option to customise the UI. Devs are on LSD."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tried updating Chrome 2 times and both times I had to Uninstall due to words not being legible. Each letter to a word is missing parts of the letter, making it impossible to read an article. I find this to be a royal pain. Especially when I'm trying to do research and am unable to read about the products. Please try to fix this issue. This is my first review. I don't do reviews, but had to this time."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Chrome was working fine, but after updating, now whenever I watch any video whether it is on youtube or any other video website, the video freezes and then lags but I keep hearing the audio. So I uninstalled the app and when reinstalled the app it started working fine, but it shows the option of update, and if I update, I again start facing the same problem, so now apparently I am using the older version of chrome. Kindly look into this bug. Thank you."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your previous iteration of this browser was functional, minimalist, and most of ergonomic. You have so badly cocked up this UI design ""upgrade"" that I have uninstalled the browser already. The human thumb cannot reach the bottom of the screen while still having a firm grip on the device one handed. P.S. I have a Google phone and will be trading it for an apple as soon as able."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is my go to; always will be. I've tried other browsers but none can, or do, compare. The browser is not only fast but boasts other features, such as: - page preview - import/export files, bookmarks, settings, accounts , passwords... even where you left off in a book you've been reading. - easy access to ALL of Google's very comprehensive programs, apps, and so-so much more... IF, by some odd set of circumstances, you have NOT used Chrome before l, then go check it out for yourself ‼️"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Up until v91, fairly intuitive, fast, and sufficient. In v91, the forced tab grid layout makes it difficult to navigate multiple tabs as I require for use. Doesn't seem like Google is very interested in maintaining usabilty; you may want to try something else. The icing on situation is that they dont even pretend to read the email listed for feedback. While you can uninstall updates to get your phone or tablet's baked in version (v86 for me) it's not very safe to do this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm stuck in an update loop. So I get a notification in Chrome saying that a new update is available, I click ""update"" and get taken to the play store, where I click update again and a little wheel spins but nothing seems to be installed. My two choices then are ""update"" and ""open"" despite having just updated. I go back to chrome and the update notification is still there. It's amazing that a browser made by Google running on an operating system made by Google would be so buggy."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Classic bait and switch. Chrome was advertised as a web browser, but later claims make clear that it is software for pushing stuff you did not request: Smart personalized recommendations. Chrome creates an experience that is tailored to your interests. On the new tab page, you will find articles that Chrome selected based on your previous browsing history."

I have to close it and open back to continue. This happens very frequently , about 10 times in half an hour use. Please resolve this. It's very annoying. I don't want to switch for other browsers. I am editing my previous 5star review for this. Regards"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible and heavy handed approach with forced group tabs/ grid layout. The new group tab/ grid layout is, in my opinion, horrible and unintuitive. However, I understand that some people may like it as it truly is a subjective thing. That said, I despise Google's approach of forcing the feature down our throats with each update. Give us back the option to disable the group tab/ grid layouts at our discretion."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Browser opens on its own. Over the past 2-3 weeks Chrome windows are opening on their own to webpages I don't know. I don't have a virus/malware etc. Android phone is clean. It just seems to be the browser itself and I can't get it to stop. Can't uninstall (only the updates). Have cleared everything imaginable. Making me want to go iPhone at this point.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please google, don't listen to those complaining, I like the grid view, I like how my work are arranged, it's easy for me to catch on. Am now upset cause I can't find the option to set it back, Cause it suddenly went back to the old way it was. And this why am giving you 2 stars, you guys should find a way and balance this, some people find it hard to adjust."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Had no real issues with the browser, except one a while back, can't remember, but now...everytime I'm in fullscreen mode streaming videos online, the grey navigation bar appears and won't go away. Tried disabling PIP, uninstalled updates, lost all my bookmarks/open tabs, and the issue persists. Have since switched browsers because I can't deal with that nuisance. So many people over an extended period of time have complained about this on Reddit, and nothing's been done. I don't understand."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am really pleased with the recent update.They now include the option to either show or hide the suggested articles that show up first thing on the screen so it is convenient for both parties that either want news stories on their browser or don't, so it's a win-win situation. I hope that the creaters of this browser keep it up. Browser is fast as always."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Awful after the latest update. I've been using this for years and loved it. Lately the links don't open, I just get a white bar across the top of the screen. Rather than letting me type my complete my search request the app suggests other apps stored on my phone after typing the first letter. The keyboard disappears and I have to wait for the app suggestions then start my search again. I thought it might have been a phone issue but its happening on my husbands chrome app too."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is completely broken for me now, it won't update, it force closes, I cannot do any searches or view tabs I have open. I cant do anything. I have tried everything including reset, uninstalling, deleting cache, deleting data, etc. Nothing works. I am going to have to download another search engine because this one sucks so bad and is completely unusable"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had almost no issues with using chrome, until randomly I can no longer have pages in a group. The button is still there, but it doesn't do anything. All it does is open it in a new tab, and the way its formatted is awful. No preview, doesn't show much info, zero organization. If an update caused this, fix it please. EDIT: I had to edit the flags to re-enable it, when before it was just active. I don't know why google even disabled it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall this is a simple and easy to use browser that I feel secure using. The content is always relevant. I enjoy the ability to highlight and navigate from one page seamlessly to another site with the same quality of comparable content. That being said The TABS! Are just aweful! The second you open a new tab you're stuck in a vicious loop of redirecting back to main browser to begin a new. Saves main pg over and over every click.I Wish that didn't happen. Other then that, I love it! Thanks!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest layout sucks. Apart from back, all main chrome buttons (menu, new tab etc) are now at the top of the app/phone making them much harder to reach. Before they were all located on a pop out menu along the bottom which came out whenever you scrolled up, easy and convenient to use one handed. This is now a two handed operation. Very frustrating."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has been unable to update manually or automatically for about a year now, I am using a galaxy z flip 3 which came out two weeks ago. Also the solutions page for this issue, does not provide an actual solution. Fix your updates google.EDIT: I want this OFF my phone. I Uninstalled the updates per the solutions page, which was a big mistake. Beacuse now it won't even update back to where it once was. The developer contact email is no longer functional, and they give 0 care for cust. Service"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Move the Tabs button back down to the bottom bar. Why would you want Home and Search on the bottom but not the one function that you use almost every few seconds? You might as well just get rid of the bottom bar at that point. I don't want to go back to having to activate one handed mode or use both hands to do a basic function that was perfectly fine where it was. You didn't even put anything else down there. It's just more empty space now. Very very very silly change.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This browser was great, till your last update!!! Now my phone is glitchy all the time when I do attempt to use Google chrome browser, if by any chance the browser is open, remains stuck and I've been forced to restart my phone. Started using Firefox, at least there is no problems with this browser so far! Well done Google Team, well done!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. Day after day it was the same display and nothing changed. Then, as of 6/1/21, you can no longer view your tabs as a list, with no choice to change it. This, for me, is the final straw. How could they force an update with no choice to change it?! That's completely unthinkable to me from a customer service perspective. The only way to even fix this particular issue is to download an APK and disable updates. I've lost trust in this app and it's developers."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good browser for secure downloads. I've downloaded files of over 1Gb several times though downloads have failed a few times. But I'm constantly bombarded with ads, especially banner ads & video ads that just keep popping up or running on every page that loads. This has been happening even after enabling the very limited adblock feature. Navigation & lite mode are also very limited. Also, your latest update isn't installing. The update button isn't working. Edit (10/08) Finally updated 😁"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has been the best ever growing browser I have encountered due to the speedy access and graphics mode to mention a few. But of most recent after so many updates and and with changed features it becomes frustrating, because I couldn't find special dial feature which I use in other browser like opera mini. It would have been of great use and importance, because it gives me the perfect access for the forgotten sites which may come in handy at the perfect time of need."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been using Chrome for years and have been extremely happy with it. But like others have reported recently, this app has gone down the crapper. Freezes up all the time, I get that ""aw snap"" screen when scrolling through Google search results all the time, and has been generally unstable. As much as I enjoy seamless connection when using Chrome among all my devices, guess it's time to switch to Firefox."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have used Chrome for appx. 18 years and this is absolutely terrible. Have been unable to load update and have been having trouble with version I have now. Locking up, high-jacking me to unknown, undesired places. Sensitivety to touch is unpredictable. This is not a comprehensive list of issues I have encountered. Chrome went from ""go to"" to ""what happened"" in a flash. I will be using other browsers while hoping to see some positive response to fixing all issues. Even the ""Tell us more"" fails."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely hate the tab groups. I don't want to open a new tab, and it go into a tiny box. It slows down my work flow when switching between tabs. It's highly inconvenient and no longer able to be turned off. I liked chrome, but not enough to keep me from switching browsers over this. There are a lot of good browsers that don't force group tabs."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's just fine, however I have a suggestion! In my chrome browser I have plenty of open tabs some of which I can lose track of sometimes, so I was thinking what if you implemented a feature where you could change the position of the tabs to help with organization, and etc. just like in the chrome browser for computers. I honestly think that this is worth looking into, but other than that the app is pretty much perfect. (Edit: Thank you for implementing some organization.)"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly, and silently, reinstalls itself. Removes my review frequently as well. I have to uninstall this several times a day, yet it continues to return. The email link for contacting the developer is out of date as well, resulting in an automatic reply stating that the address is no longer monitored. Probably best for them to send the complaints to a black hole; guess that's just Google sticking their fingers in their ears and repeating ""lalalalalala""."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Using that app is a daily. It works well and is wonderful. Updating is not. The updates never download nor install. Instead it is a continuous looping of tap the update, watch an endless loop of download with no downloading. This issue along with getting downloads are why this app is not worth anything more than 1 star at any given time."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Finally disabled and uninstalled this app today. It's so infuriating that the all tabs screen was removed. And replaced with a ""continue browsing"" screen. Switching between tabs now is too complicated, from swiping to multiple clicks. And you can't even read the tab between. It's these little useless changes and rearrangements they constantly make that makes this app unbearable and tiring. All we want is a web browser. BYE."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is excellent for browsing. Almost every website can be browsed by chrome. But privacy is the most important thing to a person. Chrome should act strictly on that. Also there are some major bugs in the latest version (June 2, 2021). (1) On first opening, the search bar does not works. We've to tap on tabs and then it works. (2) When a website grabs a lot of memory chrome should pop up the ""Show Original"" button like previous version. Hope the developers solve these issues."

Extra Star for being helpful. if it works, I'll amend my review. edit: still freezes my whole phone up. also rather annoying i cannot copy the links you've posted, and i have to type them out manually."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Text box randomly closes and won't reopen, reloops onto old pages, hangs, pauses then crashes.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tabs are an absolute nightmare! They pile up in no time, and if like me you have some important tabs among loads of superfluous ones, it's a huge waste of time to try and sift through them all. To top it off, they don't even sync properly. Only a handful showed up in my Google account (thank goodness I checked!) when I needed (and still do) to do a system reset, with apparently no actual help available anywhere. And why is there only a scrolling option for tabs?? Damn, just ran out of room..."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was great until the latest update. Now it's slow, heavy, has less url information, takes up more screen with a permanent tool bar and is a real backwards step for Chrome. May be deleting it. Unless they reverse the update or fix the issues in the next 48 hours. We should be able I roll back to a previous version so we don't get stuck with this stuff. Fail Google. Massive fail. I'm using a Samsung S21 Ultra. And it's slow as on my phone. That's got to tell you how bad it is."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In my personal opinion, the Chrome App is an impressive browser that has become my go-to choice for online browsing. Its user-friendly interface and seamless performance make it a standout option. The clean design allows for easy navigation, and the tab management system ensures efficient multitasking. The ability to sync bookmarks, browsing history, and open tabs across devices is a game-changer, offering a seamle"

Intermittent freezing of input fields and navigation; application hanging; pages freeze continually. Clearing the cache etc. makes no difference. Chrome has turned into such terrible piece of s**t that, after using it since it first launched for desktop, I'm now actively seeking an alternative. I wish I could give less than zero stars. Edit: Firefox. Better, faster, and importantly: actually works"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: Yeah, that doesn't work. I've always been set up for auto updates. It just isn't doing them. It's auto updating everything else though.

Been unable to update for months even though it says it needs to."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've used Chrome since it launched. Hate the grid set up for tabs. Now you can't even change it in flags. Will have to find something else. I really can't stand the grid tabs. Takes up too much room and too much time to sift through them. Grouping involves an extra step. Change it back or make an option for both.

Thanks but no thanks."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not the best in terms of interface. There are many better browsers these days. My major cause of concern is the annoying ""ding"" sound it makes when you do a search by voice on Google website. There's no setting to turn it off. If you mute the sound in settings it only disables the readback of the search results that follows the loud ""ding"". It only goes away if you put your phone on vibrate or silent.

Well, all that happens is the circle spins a few times and stops. After repeated attempts, I decided to look at the reviews. I'll be keeping the 81 version. Google rakes in a ton of money. Hire some qualified programmers. And I see Google Docs hasn't been fixed either - still need the internet to open a document. Why do you people feel the need to track and trace????? *"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was fine. Now it won't let me update to the current version. Edit 3 months now... still can't update Chrome. Devs have stated they are aware of the issue... but haven't fixed it yet. At this point it's got 3 month old security patches. I can't continue to safely use it. I would recommend removing all permissions and disabling it. Since its integrated into the OS it is risk to the entire phone.

I click on the update button and it says pending, then stops and goes back to me having to hit the update button.

Once I can get this updated and try it out, I can redo my rating....but as of right now, its at the tops, a 2. UPDATE... more than 4 months later and I'm still unable to update this app!! Rediculous!"

This new grid view for tabs is annoying to me personally. I don't like being able to see all tabs I have open. I had a system for these, and the new layout completely destroyed it. If it works for you, that's amazing and I don't wanna bash on someone's preferences. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say please give us the option to turn it off. I may have to switch browsers if not."

I left it waiting for download overnight. I assumed my cell company's internet was too slow. I connected to wifi and had the same result. Since the first time I tried updating weeks ago, my phone is behaving more and more improperly. Now my photos are currupting one at a time. This is beyond frustrating. I'm about to give up on using a cell phone at all."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once again, Google manages to move a product from ""really good"" to ""really crappy"" in the name of innovation. It's as if there is a dev group within Google who answers to nobody, and has only one goal: to find anything useful in their apps and ruin it. Look no further than this browser, but if you must, Maps, and Play Music are a couple other examples."

I've been loyal to chrome across all of my devices, even within IOS devices. Recently, it seems that Chrome is filled with bloatware, irrelevant advertisements, and an unforgiving, ever growing cache. There's no reason the app should be running in the background for several (30ish) minutes in a day. If I clear the cache and data, why would the app triple in size within a day of NO USAGE! MALWARE!!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No doubt that the new and cluttered tab UI was pushed out untested by any average userbase, otherwise Google would've seen how unintuitive it is and never released it. As usual, this will be another forced change that users will have to get used to, with no option to revert it. You will now have a permanent bar on the bottom of the screen whenever you scroll up, with smaller thumbnails when previewing tabs. Your tabs will also now be cluttered up in a 'group', a feature no one is interested in."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I quit using Chrome. I had been gradually steering away from it anyway for various reasons, but what finally did it was the incredibly annoying giant Chrome Volume Media Control Pop up on Windows 10. You can disable it by deep-diving into the flags, but that also disables the volume controls on your keyboard, which I need. The popup got in my way again today at a really bad moment and I'd had it by then, got mad, and as of now I'm switching back to my other browsers. There's no good reason to be using Chrome these days anyway."

All of my other apps can be maintained and updated using the android playstore. There is not an option to uninstall the app. And, I do not wish to do a system restore.

Also, usually when working with multiple tabs, hitting back will close the tab and take me to the prior tab. But occasionally, hitting back will close the tab but also force close Chrome. Thanks for the suggestions Google but none of them worked. I searched the community forum and found several people with similar issues that have gone unresolved for as much as a year or longer. Same old, same old from Chrome...release a new version full of bugs and then eventually fix them after the fact...or not..."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What could be more simple than turning off the audio search results. You can do it on the Windows 10 version but the Android version is completely bombastic. What could be more embarrassing then having everyone listen to your search results in a public space. I realize the smartphone is meant to make noise and you're supposed to make noise to it but the word control is a keyword in human life and death.

I love the fact you can now choose to download stuff to the sd card, but why did they have to change the file it downloads to? I've been searching in the downloads folder where it used to go but now it downloads in the system files!! I need to access my downloads with ease- not to open several folders before I can reach it. I've already changed the browser for my tab. and may do the same on this device!"

That aside, recently, I have been battling with staying signed into my sites on Chrome for pc. I have uninstalled, reinstalled and updated severally; I have used all the DIY recommendations to no avail. I get logged out of Gmail and Chrome every now and then. Unfortunately, there's no way to contact Google about this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been decent, but some of the security features are completely broken. On-device encryption, for example, doesn't work as it should. Even when signing in to new devices, I'm unable to access my passwords, etc. The screen just changes size and does the whirling circle and then displays the exact same message screen from the device I was locked out on. That device should not have been locked out. So now I've got no passwords saved according to some versions of the app, or a whole slew of them."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be able to turn of the new tab features through the chrome flags but can no longer do so. The new tab grid function feels like a hassle and is very uncomfortable to navigate, much less the tab groups. If you're going to insist on including them, at least kindly offer an option for those who prefer the previous tabbing format. Also has been having multiple issues after it does any updates lately, & I often hesitate to even bother to anymore. This recent one makes really me wish I hadn't."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is by far the ugliest update I've ever seen. The white on absolutely everywhere is blinding, even in daylight. The tab scrolling is so inefficient if you have many tabs open, as I usually do. The shape of the URL bar is such an off-putting shape too, everything looks forced and ugly. Everything was perfectly fine before. PLEASE add an option to revert back to the old look, or at least add dark theme. Maybe asking your users permission to update would be nice, as, you know, every other app does."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really like using Chrome. The grouping tabs update were sudden but I was able to get used to it and it actually worked fine. But suddenly the grid tab layout were gone! Now my tabs are all mixed up and unorganised. Please make in optional at the very least. I also have been having an error trying to install the said new update? I am definitely not enjoying this.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UI is NOT user-friendly. Tall phones are the norm, but Chrome on Android insists on a top-centric UI. Even Chrome's old bottom-centric UI, Duet, was deliberately removed, despite its intuitiveness. The new Tab Strip helped, yet it never stayed up, failed to offer the menu, & was merely an experiment. But that's gone too. & so is the vertical tab stack: No more thumbing through open tabs w/ one hand, the Grid can't be disabled. Google seems uninterested in designing Chrome for phone users."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2 star. Chrome is supposed to be the best and most secure. I think Google has best intentions but Chrome has inadvertently left some kind of vulnerability out there many times in the past that I end up spending tons of time having to figure out how to undo whatever some malicious intent people figure out how to exploit. Google you guys ultimately take the reputation hit in my eyes when that happens. Hate that this is pre-loaded and never truly removes it.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For over a month now, this app says it needs an update and will not allow me to download it. When I press update it shows the loading circle (sometimes), but it's not actually updating anything. It just says it needs to update again and never installs. I thought after time you would put out another update that fixes this but no.. nothing. I uninstalled the older updates thinking that was the problem, but it still does the same thing. The release of my phone was less than a year ago so, why?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bad experience. Ever since i updated to Android 10 i noticed issues with chrome. The search bar freezes up. It becomes unresponsive. The only way to fix it is to go in to settings of its storage, clear cache, clear data, then clear all data. Only when you see it looks like its freshly indtalled again will it work. Chrome is the best android browser when its working properly hands down. So they need to get it together pronto."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Before, if I were to use a single word to describe Chrome, it would have been ""convenient"". For managing across multiple OSs, grouping tabs, and extensions (on the desktop). Now, the word I'd use is ""ads"". From the large square ads that appear on almost every other paragraph, to the ads that appear to the top and/or bottom of the screen, and to ads that appear when going from one page to another. At first I thought it was the website itself, but this seems to occur only when using Chrome."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This really sucks as it seems to be screwing up the entire usefulness of this phone. The Google chrome app when ever it goes to chrome for info or whatever it takes forever and the it constantly pops up and tells me to wait or exit or update chrome. That would be great if it did so however it just goes right back into the same old and apparently outdate chrome app. Time after time after time if your following!

If u click on the white part of the page it takes you somewhere but you don't know where you're going. I have internet connection.

The headings are all super big, and the main content is in a way smaller font. The accessibility feature that I previously used it adjust the font isn't working right. Also, the option to tap the screen a couple of times to make it reset the site to normal after zooming isn't working right. It's been super annoying trying to get my sites back to my preferences."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best browser for Android for sure. Very fast, no bloat (see Edge and Brave), very cool dark mode flag, sync with desktop. My main issues are that they replaced classic image search with Google Lens which is much worse and doesn't show higher resolution image. The grid tabs are weird and clunky, never understood why this was changed from Safari-like horizontal tabs. I want a bottom address bar flag/option so bad to use browser with just a thumb. Also where's extension support?"

At first, it was slow loading a page, and then it would freeze and start over. After a few seconds, the screen would be blinking, trying to load over and over and over. Restarted my phone and tried again the same thing happened. Ran a diagnostic, virus, malware scan, and checked my network for suspicious activity, nothing. I ended up disabling it."

For the better part of a week I have been attempting to update the app. I have rolled back updates, disabled and re-enabled the app, tried downloading over wifi and mobile data, etc and nothing seems to remedy the issue. When the app actually works as intended, though, it is a solid web browser. Other than the ridiculous new tabbing system, that is."

What's worse is if you are loading a lot of news on Chrome's news new tab thingy and opening a few in a new tab, you then have to scroll up like a mad lad for ten seconds to see the little icon that allows you to switch tabs. Great design Google, bright idea. And we can't even downgrade system apps. Already looking for alternatives.."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"okay, but it's extremely limited compared to other browsers like cromite (which blocks ads) and firefox (which has support for desktop extensions). the blink engine is lightning fast and generally has the best support for web standards... except for the ones it intentionally breaks. even then there's the elephant in the room: chrome is basically spyware. if you care about online privacy then AVOID CHROME AT ALL COSTS. i'd recommend brave over this as it's a good alternative for most prople."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I do have to say that the new cleaner design is very harsh on my eyes. So much white! So much! And i mean pure white, not off-white or a little bit tinted white, but pure white. For the first time I am reaaalllly in need of the dark mode option! If you gonna stick to this design, atleast give me the option of dark mode. Incognito is perfect, but it sucks to browse in it because of the aim of it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The recent UI change is terrible. WAY too much white everywhere, it hurts to use, even during the day. The new home page icons look terrible - all they did was take the old icons, shrink them, and put them inside a circle. And all the UI elements are now unnecessarily rounded. Technically the app still functions to browse the web, but the interface is god awful."

But after having the same tabs open in other groups or having issues due to dyslexia, I just can't be patient enough with it anymore. And it definitely doesn't seem to help data or efficiency. Also, can't update my chrome. It hasn't given me any issues because I can't, but the RED arrow gets me worried when I forget it's just an update button. Google says they do this for us, but they don't listen to any of these complaints..."

Sure, it's pretty, but it's damn painful to look at. Turning down the brightness of my phone only makes it difficult to read. Bring back the black! Or at the very least enable us to customize it so we can make it whatever color we want. Like black! Until then, goodbye chrome."

It's also nice to log in anywhere and have all my favorites and bookmarks on my browser.

Just when I think I've have successfully accomplished it, I get a message the next day asking ""Do you want to download Google Chrome?"" The instructions are terrible; for example, when they tell me to click on ""run,"" there is no ""run"" on the screen. This application is one of the most frustrating of all the apps I have encountered in the past several years. I just tried again and I have no idea whether I was successful. I give up. Bing is MUCH better anyway. Pichai Sundararajan can kiss my ass!!!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The only search engine I will ever use. Though with the new update, the bright white when switching tabs hurts my eyes. The black was easier to handle. If possible, I would love to be able to have that color available as an option again. Not just for myself, but for the benefit of everyone else. It's headache inducing right now, so I try and avoid it as much as I can (or turn my screen brightness to the minimum just to switch, which is a hassle). I also agree with many other people that the new, more rounded design is awful. I liked it more square. TL;DR: The new UI is bad overall. The rounded-ness is unnecessary. It's harder to see things and everything seems more crammed all together. There is too much white now. It hurts and gives me a headache. When will this nightmare of downgrade updates for apps on the appstore end?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tab grid layout is the worst non-voluntary setting! At least make it something you can shut off! If you hate the tab grid layout, uninstall version 91.0.4472.120 (released 6/22/21) and disable via the chrome flags menu. Otherwise you're stuck with it and have no other way to opt-out. Only other option is to get a new browser app and don't look back. (11/03/21) If you update to Android 12, it automatically makes Chrome into tab layout with no way to turn it off. I HATE THIS."

I've had issues with Internal Server Errors on websites that I've used for years, ones that have no issues using any other browser.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever the heck you did to the News Feed feature needs to be reverted back completely ASAP!!! The updated layout is super annoying in every way possible compared to the older one; it no longer shows me the things I'm interested at like it did before, while only shows local news plus more local news! Also, article details, which showed underneath articles title, don't appear anymore!!! I don't understand the reason behind these major stepbacks honestly, but I hope they get sorted out soon."

EDIT: It gets worse: for some reason it's now including one-time searches from over a month ago in the ""frequently visited"" home tab. Can't switch it off"

I absolutely hate the grid view and think we should at least be given the option, especially since you're forcing the updates on us. For me its impractical, harder to find my pages and I don't like that opening a link from a page automatically groups the tabs. It's poor customer service response. I'm probably finding a different mobile browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chrome used to work fine until the last couple of months. I got all of the following at different times: screen flashing; screen blank; and the screen overlaying itself until the screen is a blur. The only fix that has worked for me is to clear the app of ALL data and the cache. You have to sign back in but it seems to work. This could be a non issue if Chrome would get onto the above problems and fix them. I've used Chrome for years and now it's having problems. Why? More flashing. Why?

I often like to see if features Google adds are any good. *Enhanced Security* seems like a progressive step. Will be keeping an eye on it. Honestly, as I've stated in my Google reviews before, condensing some apps that share similar functions would be a good idea, imo. There is way too much bloat having an app for every little thing; would be less confusing for consumers."

Continually crashes the moment I open it. Has never done this before."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The grid layout for tabs and the tab groups make it impossible for me to use the app. New changes that drastically change the way a user interacts with the app must be made optional and not be foisted on users without any way to disable it. I had it disabled in the last few versions of the app using flags but that no longer works. Truly one of the most horrible things to do to the app.

I installed it, and pages seemed to be loading faster - so far, so good, but then i went to clear caches, and it was taking FOREVER. I looked at how much it was clearing, and it showed that it was clearing only sites i had visited in the past hour! I restarted the phone, and pages were all taking ten minutes to load. I think it seriously messed up my phone. I installsd duckduckgo and bing, and now even those taking forever to load pages."

Now it's all disorganized and is also copying the way Safari organizes tabs. Yes I had an iPhone before. I haven't noticed anything else that's awful about the update, but the tab sorting is bad enough that I have to uninstall the updates because I literally can't stand the update.

I want to get rid of trending searches, but can't because it inists cookies are disabled. Never update this app: it just won't work if you do."

After Request Desktop Site is checked, the next time you open up the SAME site again, it defaults to the mobile version again. Chrome has the memory of a goldfish when it comes to Requesting the Desktop Site. It's terrible. With website designers that have no knowledge of a designing good mobile site, Chrome does less than the bare minimum to help its users have a good browsing experience."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have used chrome as my number 1 browser for well over 10 years. This new version is messing up text so you can't read anything. I sent complaints but heard nothing back. I tried to use an older version but it keeps updating back to this non working one. Even after I turned off auto updates. I'm finally done with chrome thanks to them forcing me to use this new non working version. It's been a long road and we had some good times but now it's time to move on and try something new.

I'm not sure what changed, but now it is unbearably slow opening, closing, switching between tabs, browsing, and just slow and almost unusable. All of the other apps on my phone are fine.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The ui and ux are very bad. All phones are tall now and yet google has chosen to keep all the options at the top. Most browsers have shifted them to the bottom to make it easier for the user. Also who's stupid idea was it to remove the option to prevent autoplay of videos on websites. Most news realted websites play videos for no reason. It's such a waste of bandwidth and power. How are these not obvious things to be working on instead of turning chrome hometab into a news feed.

It's extremely difficult to switch between tabs, the app is lagging ALOT, it is very slow, and ""does not respond"" often and the app then needs to be closed.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The newest update forces you to view tabs side by side. I absolutely despise not having the vertical viewing. All to the point of using a different browser. If they don't fix this soon I will ultimately switch. The other thing about the update is that now when you close all tabs it doesn't open up a new one with your homepage. I loved the old feature with the ease of doing so.

No, no it's not. The new features suck."

Force stop the app when it refuses to do anything and it will do the web search. Good luck opening any pages though. And what's with the grouped tabs thing? You can't tell how many tabs are open in a particular group. The snapshots and addresses don't always show in the tab window. It's like the chrome dev's for android forgot how to code or something. I'm done. Going to a different browser.

For those interested in science, Google is knowdlege poor."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The only way to describe this app has a different approach on logics. The results are different from the other ways apps can be designed.

I love Chrome on desktop, but with every update, new and unwanted features appear in the app, ruining the user experience. Tab grids -- makes sorting through tabs unintuitive and prone to closing apps accidentally. Tab groups -- because separate tabs were too straightforward (plus, who needs the bottom of the screen).

It looks horrible and is cumbersome to navigate: the look and feel are awkward and inelegant. And, there's no easily apparent way to reset to manual update preference. I suppose that's because the way the app looks and works and feels is now so crappy, many would elect to revert to an earlier version. The inability to do so forces us to work with what is. As it us now, you can't even uninstall the update. Google: not so good any more."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While I strongly appreciate the ecosystem in which Google has created, there is a feature in the Chrome Android mobile app that is absolutely frustrating and WILL push me to finally make the switch to a different browser both on mobile and desktop if it is not retracted or at least given the user an option to disable it. That ""feature"" is... GROUP TABS. I do not for the life of me understand why this would be implemented without still having the option to open a link in a new (non group) tab."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"do you know how they say: ""if it aint' broke don't fix it""? well if Chrome isn't broke then stol updating it in ways it will break even more! since the last few updates, Chrome would not open anymore, so I uninstalled the updates, and installed them again, but now it's stuck in the first version, making many websites not work, it is slow, and just has a lot of problems. maybe you should work on REALLY fixing your apps instead of adding up more problems. just go back to ruiining the play store."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new updates on this app was not well thought. I've been experiencing a lot of problems now that I've updated it. Instead of downloading pictures directly from images now I have to go to the website and actually look for the picture which is not very convenient. The new updates also made me open several windows instead of tabs and I don't know if it's just me but some of my windows actually disappear and I have to search it again in my history. I can't watch videos easily from other websites as well as download files from websites that I have been using for years. Although I appreciate the thought of updating this app for the betterment, I just wish the old Google would come back. I regret ever updating this app after not updating for almost a year. This is a disappointment."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update totally messed the UI. I am using the Duet feature for almost an year. Having all controlls at the bottom is really convinient. Having in mind that almost all new phones have 6"" or bigger screens this feature is a must. However some genius at Google desided that it is a great idea to put only half of the buttons at the bottom and the other half at the top without any way to configure that. I am really interested to understand the thought process behind this decision!?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,What can I say. Chrome has been my all time hero. Saved me from Internet Explorer and the 1998 Sasser worm the intelligent 14 year old European genius that shut down the worlds credit card system for one full week. Even though I dump Chrome for others at times . Its always there when I need it most.. TY Google and Chromium !!!!

Delete it or tell me how to. Im not hiding anything, So I don't need it. Also if I can see it is not working. It is like a creepstranger pervert in my home ."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not working with system update AT ALL. Data was reset multiple times and still a no go. Developer, the browser just idles. I have two phones and your suggestions are unhelpful, to say the least."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star due to a fatal flaw that's been affecting me for a long time: there is no consistent way to close tabs, individually or all at once, without opening the tab select screen (I'm not sure what to call it), which always results in a crash if too many tabs are open. It's a paradox, and a serious problem. Implement a ""Close current tab"" function to the dropdown menu (where bookmarks & history can be accessed), along with a confirmation for accidental taps."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first i was uncomfortable with the new layout being grouped and stuff, but then i was used to it. But now suddenly it went back to the old layout where it become vertical. I don't know what google want to do exactly. It better to just stick to one of the layout or else just make it customable to choose which layout we want, rather than switching it back and forth like this"

Thank you software developer and project manager. I waste my time because of your job. I should be proud of yourself. Next time add more ads, more,more,more, so I can switch back to firefox."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have always used this app. But now its unusable! When I open it, its a 75% chance it will open a blank page which is frozen and won't do anything. So I have to shut and open again after a few seconds. Also when it does work, you start typing in the search bar, and it'll freeze and delete everything I wrote, close the keyboard and go back to the search bar. This has gone from the best to the worst unfortunately. Please fix these issues!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Collects way too much user data, no quit or exit button, always reopens the last visited page on startup, plugs up internal memory. It should be just 1 click to exit the browser, and I at start I only want an empty new page, arrows forward and back would be a great addition and make navigation even more enjoyable. Favorites should be accessible easier by clicking on the address bar at the top or a button at the bottom."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Even on flagship devices, boot time is awful. It takes 4-6 seconds to boot. (Snapdragon 845) Switching tabs is not convenient since the button to do so is placed at the top of the screen. If devs only gave the option to move the nav bar at the bottom of the screen, and speed up the boot, it would be perfect. Everything else is great. Until then, I'll probably be using Opera on mobile and also on desktop (just to keep things in sync)"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This really is a terrible browser. It's on par with Windows Explorer. The only difference is that it allows a lot more malicious ads, trackers, and malware onto your system with extreme ease. On top of all that, it must be one, if not thé slowest browsers I've ever experienced. It's extremely unoptimized. It even feels like the developers don't give a cr@p about the program or the consumer. It's really, really terrible for a software development giant. The only upside is that it's free."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too many additional "" WOW"" items. Security has been too compromised. Something or at least a choice of a browser that does less but more securely would be more to my liking. The information leaked by this browser is unbelievable. You can only reduce the leaked information on with add-on laptops not in phones. This needs to change."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what issue I am facing with chrome. It's automatically refreshing the page even I can't click a new webpage. Worst experience. Due to this switching to operate browser
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, this browser still lacks a very important feature: that of allowing text to re-flow so that it fits the screen after zooming to a level where the font is comfortably readable. That feature would greatly improve the mobile browsing experience; I am at a loss to see why google still hasn't implemented this. (Edit) I can't believe how much time has passed (original review was in 2014), and this feature is still not there (2020 now) :-("
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Up until the most recent update, it was fine. Now when I close a tab, then exit the browser, then relaunch it, the tab (or tabs) that I closed are all back open. I've cleared the cache/history in the browser, as well as reset the app entirely, and it's STILL doing this... You've GOT to fix this, it's a major issue. Nothing like the app taking a month to open, because there are 80 tabs I can't close."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This grid layout is unbearable. I've watched this app become less and less user-friendly with each passing day. The interface is glitchy, slow-loading and confusing. So many unwanted features are automatically enabled, with no upfront way of turning them off. I don't understand the purpose of forcing these changes on users who didn't ask for them and don't like them. Seriously considering just switching to Firefox and finally ridding myself of all this trouble."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A lawsuit waiting to happen. App settings, when turned off are actually being activated in many cases. Security and privacy for ""Yousers"" and ""others"" but the poor internet of ""things"" have absolutely zero privacy or ability to use the ""settings"" they choose. No real point in expanding on my experience. Action speaks louder than words. In closing, your uninstall button doesn't work. Google LLC., A Delaware corporation has many issues to fix. Added, was finally able to uninstall."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worked well for years but not now. Recently Google has failed to display searches and has defied all attempts to enlarge text on the headers so it's legible and drill down into content. Time to find a new browser I think.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's block ads and very fast. Please put the new tab back on the bottom when I press tab view with chrome duet. My screen is too big to reach the top without extra effort so moving things to the top just makes things difficult. I know there is a way to have a new tab button at the bottom but then the tab view is at the top! Also move the options back to the bottom please
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst app I have ever seen in my life recent times I receive lots and lots of ads,if I am watching YouTube means it the unknown website suddenly shows through chrome.The DNS server in my phone is turned on but also I receive too much ads.If I am learning in website in chrome means it suddenly goes to another website."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used Google as a reliable browser ever since getting my first phone about 7 years ago. So far within the 7 years, I've seen Google improved greatly with its updates. Of course, I have experienced some issues with Google, with few occurring glitches or bugs and the loading being slow, but they were easily fixed. It's definitely one of the best browsers out there. I can't wait to see what other improvements Google will offer in the future to make the experience still great."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good solid browser. Nice and stable and fast. My only complaints are that you can't view local HTML files, and can't change the home page at all. ""Don't be evil"" indeed. There's no legit user-oriented excuse for this. I'll also add that Chrome remains vulnerable to ads that pull you into other pages unrecoverably. Usually ads served by Google, so they of all people should be able to get this under control. Also, needs a dark theme option."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of the time when I search something on this browser it only shows a blank screen. Yes, there are results but I cannot read it as the browser is all white so I dont want to use this browser for the meantime until this issue is resolved."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After years of relentless performance and UI improvements, nearly to perfection, we get to see how a single update can still ruin years of progress. This ""tab group"" could have easily not been a disater if it were not made mandatory. One does not need a filing cabinet for 50 sheets of paper cleanly stacked. Now it is a nightmare to find anything when it was easy in a clean stack of pages. This, and the related UI changes, are a disaster. Years of progress ruined by a single bad idea."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tab grid sucks entirely. Breaks all the rules of UX and Product design. Adds clicks for no benefit? Yes. Increases the amount of time to do a task? Yes. Makes the experience more confusing? Yes. I bet someone just checked what percentage of people had it turned on vs off... But you forced it on amd buried the setting so deep that only power users could figure out how to turn it off. I bet if the settings were in a true GUI settings view, many more users would have turned it off."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I type in the site I'm looking for and something totally different shows up, or I just open chrome and web sites I didn't ask for just start opening on there as soon as I open the app. Not good sites open without typing anything. Wish could uninstall it but it is stuck on my phone, I guess so they can watch what I'm doing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the last update, I'm experiencing frequent crashes. The app fails to load several times....there is just a white screen... that's it....& then you get a message that chrome isn't responding. Sometimes it works...but most of the times it doesn't. This is very frustrating. You guys just destroyed one of the best browsers. I'm switching to brave."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome used to be one of the best browsers. Unfortunately overtime it has become a pain to use. The biggest problem is the UI changes, namely grid tabs and grouping. While on paper it seems like a good idea. It fails in the real world and makes the whole interface feel cluttered. Another problem I noticed is the overuse of animations, while they might look pretty to some people. They feel awfully slow and annoying, almost like it's adding latency. Not everything has to be animated!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constantly freezes, been doing that for months now! And on 2 different phones that have plenty of power. It happens while scrolling a page, it simply stops and doesn't react anymore. I can then either wait for 30 secs or switch to another app and back, then it's usable again. Useless as a browser! Tried the Beta version, same thing. This is ridiculous!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am VERY close to switching browsers. I use a pixel phone, so I would hope chrome would work, but it frequently has issues. One of the most common is when opening the app. I just get an about:blank page and cannot load anything else without force closing the app. It's absolutely absurd that something as simple as a browser gives me so many issues."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: still terrible, constantly freezes when trying to close a tab or switch. Sometimes the browser freaks out when trying to open a new tab and loads something out of history then goes back to then tab page then loads a new tab. Such a great team you guys have 👎 Still regressing. The discovery articles are trash, again. Still can't swipe away, and now get suggestions that are sometimes a year old, and there's not even a ""more"" option at the bottom or anyway to refresh them. Thanks dumbasses"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A few months ago something broke within the browser. A quick search shows tons of people having the same issue; the browser doesn't respond after it starts loading a new page. Seems to be much worse when there are videos embedded on the page. My quick fix is switching apps. Once back in chrome it's loaded onto the page you clicked on. Seems as if the browser doesn't update what you're seeing on screen and locks up while loading the page in the background. I have a OnePlus 7 Pro. Android 10.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update it started bugging out on me. Now and again when I'm in the middle of a search the browser will close and a text box pops up saying ""Unfortunately, Google chrome has stopped working."" Thereby causing me to have to start my search all over again. The previous version wasn't like this at all. I use google chrome because it's safer faster and more secure than the default web browser on android phones. Please fix this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New Features I like the password scanning option, but make it easier to delete compromised ones as well as multiples of the same password (sort by date, multi-select would work) This bs where I can't login to the free wifi around town cause it's a redirect is retarded. McDonald's isn't trying to fish my account 🙄, so I've been using Edge to get around it, at this point my preferred browser. Uses way less ram, The collections thing is pretty awesome, can use third party extensions."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the best browser for Android. It's fast, nicely designed and syncs your bookmarks across devices. It also does some ad and pop up blocking (check settings). I don't mind seeing ads as long as they are non intrusive and nicely done. However one feature that it deperately needs is Reader Mode. I'm getting older, my sight is also getting older and so many websites use tiny fonts. I'd really love for Chrome to have the same reader as on iOS where it allows changing of the text size etc"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new translate setting mode isn't user friendly like previous version. In previous version, there's a bar on the bottom of the page to choose between the original language and English, I can switch back and forth between two languages easily whilst learning new words. NOW, the bar disappeared, can't switch between easily, if I want to switch back to original language I have to click translate on menu and then undo the auto translate so it'll go back to original language, very inefficient."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having a lot of trouble sharing pages through the browser window pops up and nothing happens. Usually have to shut the app down to get it to work. Update: March 17, 2021 Since the last update, my share options are limited to only a handful of things like print and copy link. I am no longer able to share an article via text or to Instapaper. It's not my phone when I switch browsers; I have no problems."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google Chrome is a widely-used web browser known for its fast performance, sleek interface, and robust features. Users often praise its efficient browsing speed and smooth user experience. Additionally, Chrome's extensive extension library allows users to customize their browsing experience, making it more convenient and personalized. On the negative side, some users may find Chrome to be resource-intensive, potentially impacting system performance, especially when multiple tabs are open."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has always been a great browser but the past few years Google has been pushing features on everyone with no option to disable. Reader mode came and went, tab groups suddenly appeared and can't be turned off (which I can't stand), the toolbar used to have an option to be at the bottom but they took that option away, and there's no way to block ads or install extensions. Chrome on Android no longer offers a great experience. Firefox or Kiwi are great alternatives, or Safari on iPhone."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting the ""aww snap"" message when ads at the bottom of a page come through. I thought oh, I need to update Chrome or something... Nope. I hit update, it loads for a second, and still says update. Imagine being so broken that the update button doesn't even work... Moving on to a new browser. Hopefully edge has an app. Way better than Chrome these days"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is a simple take instead of all the other browser options you have on Android, but it does browsing mostly well and it is being improved quickly. I always come back to whenever I try others. The one that lasted longer was Opera but speed was an issue. The few interface changes like grid and groups are proving to be quite useful. The recent problem is that it freezes a lot and is a know issue in some phones for quite some time now. I'm moving to Edge that is more stable and as good as this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fast and Secure? I don't know! Buggy and frustrating? Effing Yes! What is wrong with Chrome? It keeps on freezing again and again, it can't properly display images from web searches and instead just shows black objects. It's just gotten so bad! The reason I'm putting out this review is because I used to enjoy using Chrome, it felt smooth and easy, but that time is way in the past and I seriously hope you guys fix these issues."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did you messed around with the nav again ? I need all my essential navigation controls in the bottom. You had something pretty functional, and you broke it with the latest update. Now my tab controls are split with either new tab or tab switcher at the bottom but not both. Who comes up with that stuff ? I know there are people who like their controls at the top. Make it an option, and leave it alone. Focus on something useful like ad blocker or effective prevention of video autoplay."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As an Android user, ads have made this app barely usable. Chrome doesn't allow an effective as block and I have a small screen which means I get to misclick on ads on a regular basis. On top of that, they'll expand to take up screen real-estate and the ""x"" don't work. Auto play video ads have even crashed the browser. So now I use the alternatives. If it were just banner ads at the top and bottom it would be fine, but usually when I read an article, 1 or 2 thirds of the page are ads."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Forcing tab grid view and tab grouping makes an app designed for web browsing more complicated. I find this is not conducive to productivity in every day implementation. While many if us are technologically savvy and can adjust easily to changes, many are not and I can see this being particularly confusing for users who are not. I appreciate the effort and time it takes to develop new features for the world's most popular browser, but please consider making these optional for the user. Thank you"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been my browser since I got this phone. All features are working really well but after this recent update, something went wrong. I can't send a picture in FB because Chrome stops as it says. I can't even report it. This is just one problem I encountered (there's still more bugs in it) and it pushed me to uninstall this app just for now. I hope you fix this so I can use my favorite browser again. Thank you."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1) Bring back the duet features where all the buttons are at the bottom! As phones keep getting bigger and bigger, why would you make users go to the top of the screen to use the buttons? 2) Adding favorites is a pain. It always adds to the last folder. We should have the option to choose the favorites folder to save to. 3) The ability to open the same tabs across devices is missing. I keep lots of tabs open on my phone. I also want to open them on my PC or tablet."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing my original review to tell how I feel about it now. It has a horrible operation that never fails to make me cringe every time I start using the otherwise decent Android browser again. If you are in your tab view mode, and accidentally press on the ""close all tabs"" option, then that's it, there is no way you can recover the works you have been doing. You can find maybe the last five tabs you closed in the ""recent tabs"" menu, but all the other tabs are gone. No option to undo or restore."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just read in reviews that people are not liking the grid view but I think that was more useful as I can group similar tabs together and compare and check different tabs simultaneously. But now as I opened chrome it is showing tabs as like the older version and I don't like it. There should be a option to switch to the one you like. Play store is showing an update for chrome but I'm unable to update it, I don't know why. When I click on update button it loads for a while and then stops."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whenever I watch something in Chrome it gets stuck. I can hear the audio. The screen often freezes. I have to go back to main screen in my phone and reopen the app to move on. It is extremely annoying. Well i tried clearing cache this is simply not a user related issue. In addition to my problems I'll give you another one when i try to copy a text the app shows me another page. Wth is wrong with this app i don't get it. I have tried every solution possible but it sucks.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Could be a good browser. But after constant issues with video playback, on multiple devices, over way too many months, I'm tired of it. Support doesn't seem to be on too of problem solving at all, and I'm not interesting in using the dev version to try and solve it myself. And no, just downloading files to device is not a solution; that's a feature that's ever present on any web accessing device on the market. Don't waste your time using this on Android. You will be disappointed."

I have no clue where they came from and have asked several times for you to make them stop.It won't even let me be on a help page long enough to read what it says.) tho I did not get much help from you to fix my problem. As I said it would not let me read the help pages as you suggested. I have been able to stop the issues with my own persistence. May I suggest that you take the time to e-mail a person and help.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tab grouping is horrible especially since it's forced upon users. I want to close one page, not the whole string of pages I opened. This should be an option and not on by default. I also feel the tab grid is less efficient than the old card view as it was easier to read the name of a page and know what you are looking at rather than a image of a page that could have no meaning at all. After removing all flags to revert I will be switching to a new browser after using chrome for nearly a decade."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I just back and try to use chrome again, with hope that this app can do better than in past. But that's wrong. This app still... so-so. IDK what the point of bookmark, when you can't access it with ease (unlike some app that just need a swipe and you can see ever single of your bookmark). And most annoying things of all, it can closed by itself if you upload mass amohnt of images in your facebook. I tried it twice and it always forced close and I need to re-upload. Screw it. I'm gonna forget this app and come back someday if the gui is better."

What's taking so long to fix this problem?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ui, I don't want to say too much about that, just too white. The real problem is there are always some parts of texts missing on every webpage, and when you selected these texts, sometimes the missing parts will appear, sometimes not. This update is ridiculous, what is the improvement in any aspect? The only thing I see is this app is becoming worse, so this is actually not an update but an DOWNdate or OUTdate."

I can't enjoy watching porn anymore 😂😂😂😂 (just kidding about the porn part), nevertheless, the Chrome Browser is freezing alot.

Unfortunately it has been very buggy for me since a recent update: The update that moved the menu and bookmark options to the bottom of the screen. The options on the bottom of the screen only appear when scrolling upwards, which I'm fine with, however this seems to put all navigation options and buttons out of alignment. When the bottom bar is showing everything works fine, however when I scroll down and the bottom bar disappears no buttons on screen work anymore or the control is shifted away from where the button is represented to be. There are also visual problems, for example when clicking on an image on a site that allows it to show it full screen, if the bottom bar is displaying when it is clicked, the full screen image is shifted. Please fix so I can re-rate to 5* again! Thank you!"

Sometimes, we need specific websites to be blocked. An option to specify the URL of the websites would be nice. Also, the popup notification that shows up when a download is complete blocks the view of my screen while using the browser. It doesn't go away easily. I have to wait for it to disappear. If a swiping feature to remove it was added, that would be great too."

Average browser, unreliable functions."

There's a problem with some of my tabs not opening unless I switch off my network and reload all over. It just hooks and tell me ""Chrome isn't responding, please exit"". It's happened several times.

The crashes and freezes on start up, from running ""lite"" mode when I know I have a strong wifi connection and still loading websites slow in ""lite"" mode. This is unacceptable. For now I will go with Firefox or something. Honestly I don't know what other browser to use because I've always used you! And now I can't rely on you untill your fixed!"

I read a lot of manga, and it now takes forever to load all the images in a page. It used to slow down periodically, but clearing the browser cache and history would usually fix that. After this last update nothing works. My phone has also becomes unusually hot and laggy when I'm on the app. I can't be on any other app now when I'm on Chrome and it's awful."

If there was a way to enable/disable this that would be one thing, but no, instead Chrome wants to waste my time"

I'm also not able to click the 3 dots to enter the settings of the search results. Please fix ASAP!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pros: It's fast, doesn't crash. Cons: some page elements often render too wide, pushing the margin wider than the body. So if you happen to pinch-zoom in then zoom back out, the body text shrinks where there's a big 2 cm gap between the text and the right side of the screen. So I have to manually zoom in so the text fills the screen, which pushes parts of big elements like images past the right margin, which means I have to scroll left and right to see all of those."

I've restated my phone, disable and re-enable the app,it doesn't even get a whole second before the app just turns off. Moreover, there is no update for the app, that may fix the error. But I uninstall and then reinstall it,and it is running smoothly. But It look like a pc's crome. Why?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit: update on 10/16 fixed the problem. Add my name to the list of people having issues with Chrome seemingly refreshing faster and faster on its own until it becomes a strobe light. This is also happening with the Google app (search results, news and stories opened from the feed on the far left screen). I've cleared the cache and user data, and rebooted the phone. The refresh also completely blocks the ability to tap on the three dots in order to provide feedback, so here is a review instead."

On the discover cards you can no longer press and hold anywhere on the card to bring up a menu to select, say, open in new tab, but you have to use the three-dot menu in the corner instead. Much less ergonomic. Likely going to turn off discover. Probably use an alternative browser even more now. Thanks. Update - now it doesn't seem the grid can be turned off. Great."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Seems to me that, from time to time, when losing connection to wi-fi networks regularly, Chrome goes crazy and loses all my open tabs. Or maybe it's when I open the browser without an internet connection, and suddenly I have only one empty tab -- and yes, they don't return when the connection is back on. So, until you fix this problem, I'm moving to another browser. Sorry, NSA!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This browser has been forcing me to use a list type of view for my tabs instead. Even worse, the website icon does not appear in the list, making it harder to navigate through your open tabs, since you need to read the URL instead to figure out which tab is which is which. The grid style is much more easier, since you get to see not just the website icon, but a thumbnail of the site, making it easier to see and differentiate all your open tabs"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've always used chrome. But the past few months I keep having the same problems and it seem like nothing is getting fix. I see multiple people commenting the same problems (unresponsive, loading, can't search, doesn't work at all) and nothing seems to be getting better. Chrome has become unreliable and a broken app on my phone. I can't get past the search page. I can't use at all and I don't recommend the app at all anymore."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome was fine until the most recent update. I used to have my most recent tabs at the bottom of my tab page, which makes sense when compared to desktop. There's also now a permanent taskbar which isn't disableable, leading to a terrible viewing experience. It seems like in an effort to implement new features or make it more similar to browsers, some good quality things got lost. I liked Chrome because of its ease and visual design, but not anymore - not worth it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is a really good, safe and fast browser which is recommended for others to use. I've been using it everytime and so far it's working well, but I have a problem. It is that: This often has some bug which shows the error that you have bad/no internet connection. It also shows it's loading when you go to a website or link but the loading stucks for many seconds then shows the error. Other than that, it just needs a bit more optimization."

Until a recent update (can't tell when exactly) and everything went crazy. The content on pages started rendering all wild, like bits of it are cut from one place and pasted onto another, which renders it useless. I tried updating, nothing. It's only today that I've downgraded, and the issue is gone. Thinking of moving to another browser until it is stable."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've always used Chrome and have never had any issues with it, but as of this last update I can rarely even get a website to load. I get nothing but a white screen in the chrome app, and a black screen on the Google app. It's not consistent, sometimes it will load my pages, but it's still super annoying. I mean, this is GOOGLE, you'd think a bug like this could be avoided, or at least fixed in a timely manner, but it's been over a week now. Going to find a different browser until this is fixed."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is fast. Love it. Also able to locate pages that I have just closed. It makes browsing multiple pages much easier. References are easier to cite, when doing research. Quality advertising is a big plus for me. I have particularly disliked M. Edge for it has the worst ads. And the search engine 0f M.edge is also deplorable. I have deleted it from my computer."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used chrome since pretty much day one. I loved how customizable it was. I keep things very simple on all my programs. I don't keep a bunch of tabs open, and the new grid view is more cumbersome than helpful. The most recent update completely removes the ability to disable the grid view even if you disable the flags, and this is a deal breaker for this app for me. I hate it so much that chrome is now disabled and I'm switching to a different web browser."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot stand the new UI changes and how it all looks. The functionality and ease of use for an app or really any product should be of the highest priority. This however has not been adhered to in this update. The white on white color scheme makes it very difficult yo see multiple tabs if not impossible. The bubbles around the users bookmarked icons on the home page make the images so small they are essentially useless, and the rounding out of edges and the smoothing of border lines gives the app a sloppy, hard to look at interface. With your attempt to ""modernize"" and ""make sleek"" the newest version you have put the functionality of the app and the ease of use for the user in dead last. This is not a user friendly UI and should honestly have never made it as far as it did. Until this is corrected I will be looking into competing products as a replacement."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You're seriously incapable of not making stupid changes, aren't you? What is with the change to the tabs!? It looks awful and the folder system is so clumsy and frustrating when I don't want it! I still hate the change to the pop-up window that appears when you tap and hold a URL link on a page. I still hate how the Search page function scrolls through the page to get to each result. On long pages it takes too long for the app to scroll to each one and it's annoying to wait for it."

Pages freezing, website layout breaking, text input not showing up. I was worried that something was off with my hardware (even though I bought premium less than two years ago), so I ran a 2 weeks long test run on Firefox, only to encounter zero issue. Inconvenient to have to make the switch, but worth it at this point. You've lost a loyal user!"

Most images are landscape and you want to use all of your phones high res screen. If the image is displayed too large when you go landscape then you can sort of scroll a bit to get rid of the bar, but you can't see the whole image at once. If you can see the whole image then the ability to scroll doesn't exist so the bar stays. Either way you're stuck with no solution."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No. You misunderstand. I know how to hide the articles. The thing is, i browse read those suggested article headlines. I swipe what i dont wanna read. So now, you have to scroll down through all the headlines instead of swiping the unwanted away. You scroll down far enough, you have to scroll the same way up just to access the tabs. It was a useful feature. I hope you put that back. Thank you."

Give US the choice of a dark theme and to move the menu bar to the bottom of the page. Until you do I will continue to exercise my right of choice by using Microsoft Edge.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good browser in essence. But as of the last update (98.04758. 101) on Android 11, it started to be slow. Once I open the app it takes a while to show the start page, and if i tap on the link box it shoots me out of the app. It takes two or three attempts to use it properly. It might be a bug or something or really a local problem but it is worth taking a look at."

It looks like we went back to 2010. My biggest complaint, though, is the tab switcher view. The release notes say ""Clean modern design,"" but there is virtually no contrast between the tabs with the white on light gray on white color scheme. I went looking for a dark mode or theme and was disappointed to find out there's no such thing. Please bring back the old Chrome, or at least rework the mobile UI."

My browsing style is to read a page and open each item of interest in a new tab, to look at in more detail later. It worked brilliantly. With groups, this workflow is buried in more clicks, in more than one location on the screen, with previews that are too small to see. It is infuriating. Just let me turn it off please."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new features are good. One thing I don't like or appreciate is that the picture-in-picture feature is no longer in use (and a preview feature for videos on the home screen might be in its place). I like to multi-task on my phone, and that includes watching YT while doing something else. I'm not okay with not doing that anymore. Honestly, both can be utilized, but it's not cool that the PIP feature was dropped so suddenly. Please bring it back; it's much appreciated"

Now, it just keeps loading. ALSO, if you think you're safe going incognito, nope, you aren't. Your ads in other apps will still be able to read analytics and find all the stuff you clicked while incognito, therefore you'll get unwanted ads forever because of something you planned on hiding. 😉 I would definitely switch browsers if only this weren't built-in and using up lots of space already (also, my bookmaaaaaaaaarks...)"

Any options for personalization are basically non-existent; there is no way to change the placement of any of its buttons, for example, or to choose which icons (or shortcuts) are displayed at the top of the hamburger menu... or just about anything else you could think of, really. That is its biggest drawback for me; other than that, everything else is pretty great!"

Loves to crash, more than any other browser I have ever used, and seems to lack some of the basic features for interacting with websites that other browsers have. But unlike other browsers that have given me a poor user experience, I can't get rid of this one, or stop the data it collects about me, aaand disabling it seems to affect the performance of other products. Yep."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Fine browser. However, the last update has totally ruined tabs. The cards before were easier and cleaner to navigate through. You got to see all the titles of the tabs quickly and easily. However, now you get a bunch of icons cluttering up the entire screen with little room to read the page title. They also added a new ""mini tab"" function for lack of better term. Which just eats space at the bottom of the screen. Annoying to go through popups. X icon is too small to hit making it pointless."

Unfortunately it is past its last automatic update and there's no option to buy/download the newest version.

Phones are constantly getting bigger, and Chrome USED TO have a 'Duet' feature, which would allow you to have your new tab bar at the bottom of the page. However, in the latest update, that option has been removed. I am now having to look for a different browser, as I find having to reach for the top takes longer.

At some moments tabs are ordered in the format of groups, and while reading the top search bar disappears when you scroll down, while at other times it just randomly changes to singular tabs and the search bar always stays on top, giving you less space. From what I know of, you can't choose which you want and it's really annoying how randomly inconsistent this app is."

Even if you switch to your homescreen for just a second and go back to Chrome it still does it. Very annoying and not practical at all. Especially when you don't want to reload the page. I have to split screen in order to prevent this. Ridiculous. And not practical when you want to use a website and it asks for your security code and you have to go to your email to grab it. But once you're back...The page has reloaded. Fix this.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I dont like this new update. The browser is still good, but for me personally it's the tabs that have really ruined my experience. They were fine being layered on top of each other. I could manage them much easier that way because I could see easily howany I had open and which ones were important. I don't like how they've implemented a ""tile"" layout to organize and manage these now.

When updates come through they are pretty fast. It usually requires a reboot of my PC, phone, or tablet ater installing, but it is fast - usually less than a minute, maybe 3 minutes total, from start through the reboot. Definitely the browser of choice for those who just want a stable browser, but options also let power users do their thing."

They are off center to the right leaving about a 2 inch gap on the left and part of the video on the right side is cut off. I've tried news videos & YouTube videos. It doesn't matter. If it's played in Chrome, it's off center to the right in full screen mode, phone turned horizontal. I downloaded two different browsers and the videos work fine and are full screen, nothing off center. I really don't want to switch, but I can't watch videos like that."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Last few days I had a terrible experience with the browser! The browser did not work: it kept switching between blank white and black screen backgrounds and periodic seizure and freeze fits, if I was lucky to get to the sites I needed. This morning I uninstalled and re-installed it on my tablet, but have not run the update . So far it seems to be working. It's more complicated on my Chromebook: it took over 3 minutes to boot and come to live, when it's supposed to be instant."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's convenient, yet, very intrusive. I appreciate the security; but; Chrome, it feels as if I'm being stalked. It feels like going to a public restroom with the door open. There's many features that are truly helpful but take it down a notch or two. Leave me space to breath and if I need assistance something; perhaps, not lots of page readings, explaining in short video is helpfully better and less time consuming. Plus, seeing ads on a game I'm playing!? Wow! Creepy! Loosen the collar."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Give us an option to disable grouped tabs. It's awful. The app was great before, but since it's been added every action is painful. Now there's a tabs bar both on top and at the bottom of the screen, can't scroll and stop on a web page without it popping up, it unnecessarily clogs the screen. It also automatically creates grouped tabs. Navigating between tabs is now painfully long and uses have to go out of their way to create separate tabs to make navigation easier."

Whose genius idea was it to turn those easy-to-read headers in the tabs into pages of clunky thumbnails of each page? Also, as I now have to scroll down for several screens, I've unfortunately discovered that it's FAR too easy to touch a thumbnail and send it off the screen, which closes the tab. And then the Undo option disappears before you've even realized you've lost the tab."

After a recent update, tab grouping which was earlier available doesn't seem to be available now. When I attempt to view the tab groups it gives me a long list of the tabs present, making it difficult to go to desired tab. Not sure if this is only with me or the feature has been modified. Tab grouping was better and easy."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has been great for so long, but the most recent update changes the default UI colour to blindingly bright white with no options for other colours or a dark mode. This seems like a major oversight. The very fact I cannot look at chrome in a dark room without my eyes becoming sore very quickly; is making me want to switch to a different browser app. May I suggest, and judging by the other poorly rated reviews for the same problem, put out a Hotfix to add a dark mode."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Works great, EXCEPT for all the pop-ups that can't be disabled, and will constantly pop up overtop of OTHER apps, too. Every time I use Chrome browser, I get a constant ""Chrome is not responding"" pop-up, every 5-10 seconds. It's not even true, the browser is running perfectly fine, but it just keeps popping up. This pop-up actually DOES temporarily pause the browser until it's dismissed. Plus, it pops up ontop of all other unrelated apps, as well. Until the ""close chrome"" option is selected."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just wow. I can't get used to the new tab system. It's extremely annoying. And because of this, I've moved to using a different browser app. When watching videos, other then through Youtube. There's a weird grey bar on the bottom of my screen that forces the video to be smaller on my phone, then the actual size it SHOULD be playing as on my phone. I've had issues with crashing as well. Look, if something isn't broken why fix it?!?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome has always been my go to browser on my samsung phone and my pc. But when the recent update became available I CANNOT UPDATE. It will not work no matter what I do how many times I try it. And honestly with all of the recent reviews I'm scared to update, but chrome is working properly without it. Constant glitching and freezing. Please help! This is beyond frustrating. I see other users have been having the same issue as me as well."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really hate the new bar on the bottom. websites already waste enough screen space with their little Pop ups, social media buttons, and cookie notifiers, now with this bar on the bottom, I have like 30% of my screen is actually used for the website. This also makes the interface less like the desktop version. It gains nothing. No one uses a home page, the search button I can just click on the top url box, I had tabs and ... before. All that was gained was share which wasn't hard to get to."

Sometimes it let's me scroll down my search history sometimes it pushes one single obscure topic or person related to my previous search. The news glide only loads two slides now so I can't see the top/new news articles. Totally random, buggy and overall poor execution. Is the security up to date if this app doesn't update? Probably not. Why would I get a chrome book if Google can't even run a phone browser well?"

I was trying to open a new tab and accidentally hit close all, and all my tabs I had open were gone, they have an undo for when you close tabs normally, but not for when you close all for some unfathomable reason. I lost everything I had open, hundreds of tabs, gone, with no way to reopen them, and they didn't even go into my history to be seen as recently closed."

But the app decided to just stop working, completely, on my OnePlus 7T on January 2, 2023. I've tried closing and reopening the app, restarting my phone, disabling and re-enabling the app, uninstalling and reinstalling all updates... Nothing works. It has put a serious damper on my enjoyment of my phone. Having to learn to use another browser on my phone is not something I desired."

And the worst part is I'm not even able to connect to an open wifi in an urgent situation if the app is not updated. Had a bad experience, lost a job interview. Never expected something this bad from google, ever. Even Windows explorer ws much reliable than this app. And that would be the worst insult for an app produced by the worlds largest provider of web based products. The basic right of a phone to connect to wifi being taken away."

I had to reset my phone and now I have a different version of Chrome where my tabs are boxes and half of of the sites I try to go to won't load. If I open another tab and try to go to these sites they load fine, so it's not my phone or connection. This is also happening when I keep a tab open and go back to it later - worked fine earlier, blank page now. I'm very, very disappointed in whomever did this update. It's awful."

I uninstalled & reinstalled the app but it was unsuccessful. *This app crashes more than the people driving in Rhode Island."

In this day and age where smartphones have gotten past 6 inches, a mobile browser has no business leaving its address bar at the top with no option to have it at the bottom. This is where Safari on iOS trumps Chrome and Edge on Android. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would welcome this feature."

At least give me the OPTION to reject this change.... it's completely possible to go back to the list tab layout! But, it's not obvious how to do so, so at least change THAT, please, Google?

I've tried numerous fixes and it continues to do nothing. I now get security warnings regarding needing to update the app, and am completely frustrated. Why is this happening to so many of us on here and nothing appears to be getting done with any urgency? Please help us resolve this issue, Google, because I frankly expect a lot more integrity from your company. Thx."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It’s a clean, solid, nimble piece of code for something of this size, but its lack of easy use with ad blocking plugins is no longer acceptable. I have no problem with ads in principle, but ad blockers end up being the best defense against “browser abuse”. Add to that the slow removal of useful features — the ability to edit the URL of a current page is the latest victim — and I can only conclude that Chrome aims to be “toy app of the year”. Such a pity."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's the deal with updating the app so that the menu bar and search box are now back up top? I HATE reaching up there to open a new tab. Why did you switch to a paned tab overview? It's awful, please let me see a horizontal list of my browser tabs, just like I would if I went to the app overview in Android 10. Terrible update, unfriendly UI changes."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if somebody in Google has thought about how to create browser for phones. It has so poor performance and required good data connection speed. Pages not caching, each tab loads only when it is active.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The default in-app browser that opens in most apps is chrome. Which is fine, as there's an ""open in browser"" option to open it in a proper browser app. Now that option has been changed to ""open in chrome"". It won't let me choose which browser to open the page in. I've now disabled cjrome wherever I can so it'll stop interfering in my normal flow."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worse with every update. I feel like the devs don't listen to users at all. Forced tab groups and grid tab view makes it impossible to use the phone one-handed. Plus, to me personally it makes dealing with many tabs (80+) awkward and cumbersome. Let people chose what they want. Make the tab view toggable option. Will be switching to another browser now."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Aw Snap!!!!!!!! Every since the latest update I just can't stay on Chrome for more than a few seconds. Did the same thing with my husband's phone as well. We've done everything that Chrome has suggested and I do mean everything to no avail! We've downloaded Firefox and this is a much better browser. Problem solved. I would imagine that Google is going to lose a lot of people in the coming months to Firefox because of their latest updates. Firefox works just as well, just as fast and no Aw snap!"

If a video was playing in that page, it carries on sound but with freezed image, if you were scrolling, it doesn't show you that anymore. But in reality it's scrolling. So after you minimize chrome and then open it again, you'll see that it was doing your commands and touches, just not showing them.

It had its limitations with flash and such but it always worked great...

Before this latest update I was able to disable the modern design by going into the Chrome Flags and selecting disable Modern Design and I could get the visible darker design back. But now with this most recent update, that flag is gone and I can't disable the new design. Chrome may be fast, but there's no point in loading a page fast if I'm not going to be able to read the dang thing because the contrast is far too bright all over!"

New gestures require an extra step of first swiping page down so URL bar shows up. What's worse is that it's really awkward to reach url bar quickly with one-hand-use and a big phone. Chrome keeps getting updated but no inventive features added to set it apart. I've moved to another browser.

My biggest frustration is that all of my bookmarks and passwords are in Chrome, but when the browser crashes every 7 to 10 seconds, it can be challenging to navigate into your data in that small window of time.

Another star reduced for adding up articles for you propaganda news on home page when you are not interested in seeing it. Great work Google. Update: tried clearing app data and cache. Crash doesn't seem to happen but how do I disabled articles for you in New home page? This want there before. Flag disabling doesn't seem to work.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For someone who has used chrome for going on 10 years im disappointed with the direction its taken. For me in the early days the beauty of chrome was it was a web browser and thats it. It was small, used minimal memory, clean and could easily be linked over multiple devices. Now over the years its slowly become the antithesis of this, being clunky, memory intensive and messy with many setting buried (or just removed). I know this partially due to its age and how updates effect it but its sad"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this app is great but it has some quirks that makes using it so frustrating. first when you want to stop a link from opening you have to tap the settings ivon then look for the stop to tap on by the time you do that the kink has already opened is annoying.if you guy can put the stop beside the reload it will be very helpful.secondly downloading is very slow and we also don't know how to save a page offline. thanks for understanding
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great, then good, now troubled. Chrome has been my go to browser for a long time. Its secure, fast, and other than being a memory hog, is fairly clean. Now though the browser fails to respond, doesn't actually execute searches, and often just sits there not responding. This is a wide spread problem and I have experienced similar issues in mobile and desktop platforms... I blame the recent forced support termination of some legacy extensions. I run top 5% hardware too, thus no limits there."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Past two updates I've installed have the blinding white theme which is bad enough, but it also turns the notification bar at the top of the screen white without changing my white notification icons to a different color. The only status I can see is the battery icon and the clock. This is the same in the play store and very frustrating because pulling down the dock does not show everything that is now impossible to see, so seeing it requires going to the home screen then reopening the app."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Something happened to Google Search in recent days. Ads now make up the entire initial screen of any Google search. Chrome mobile doesn't allow ad blockers, so there's no getting away from them. Slows searching right down. Whatever happened to 'Don't be evil'? Gave up and switched to Firefox with AdBlock extension. Cleaner and faster browsing. Much better."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App not loading pages. I could not get a link to load or regular web pages. I tried to delete cookies/ history/ ect with no success. I finally deleted the app and downloaded and it's working again.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not sure what is happening with the resent update and several other users have mentioned some of the areas I would have addressed. However, I have noticed that the browser on my phone seems to shut down a little more often that normal. I haven't pinned that down yet, but what I dislike about this resent update is when you close all your open windows in the browser, Chrome shuts down. It use to, for over several years prior to this last update, just opened a new window after you closed all the open windows. You might want to bring that back."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My trust was with chrome always but suddenly it became unstable, crashes, laggs and sometimes no connection but my other apps works since I'm on wifi. Rated it from 5 stars to 3 stars. Such a disappointment Google. I've never had this issue before. Dont sacrifice speed because of looks. Simplicity is the best. Edited: new update is very inconvenient the new tab styles can't operate with 1 hand!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Chrome is missing a very important feature exist in other browsers like Opera, UC, and others, it is the speed dials. Since the bookmarks often are not easy to reach, speed dials is required in the home page with synchronization ability. Also need ption to make navigation bar or address bar at the bottom to be near the fingrs, so you can switch between tabs easly by swipping, and easly accessing option menu by one hand."

It was gone. Like what the hell??? I downloaded it for almost 1 hour and it disappeared. It was about to finish and it was a very important file. I'm now using opera mini, it is way better than you. Useless."

I have tried Opera Mini and Firefox, too buggy and prone to freezing. They are nowhere close to Chrome. Chrome happens to be smooth and fast, and the Bonus is, it has a lot more features than other browsers."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My previous review was deleted. Rating lower now. The new update is horrible to put it mildly. I am exploring new browsers to use. The mini tab screens and I can't just open a new tab without it being in a group? Horrid. I cannot download documents anymore either. I have been faithful to Chrome for 10+ years between the pc and mobile versions. Not to mention it has deleted all of my bookmarks and I can't get them back. Chrome is the worst.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best web browser for basic to average knowledge base and use. Overall almost a 5 rounded up lol.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What really annoys and makes me mad is that there is not a feature that let's me get all recently closed tabs back like on the pc is I close the window I can just do ctrl shift T I think and get them back even if I haven't loaded the tabs in weeks or longer or but if it happens on mobile and i haven't loaded the tabs then the tabs are basically lost so for someone like me who always has many tabs open it makes Me beyond mad when I accidentally close all tabs and I can't get them. Fix it please!!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but now... Not so much. It seems to pick up on one keyword and then it just shows you everything except what you are looking for. For example, why would I want to see a bunch of places to buy a ac window unit when all I asked was the best way to get it upstairs?? This applies to pretty much everything I try to search. It gives you everything you don't need, and none of what you do. Firefox or Goduckgo are so much better at ""listening"" and give relevant results."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was great for like a week. . . I've never had an issue with Chrome before. Now once a week it just decides to stop working and I have to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times for it to work. Now it has groups of tabs? I see no reason for them to exsist. You should at least have the option to disable it. More frustrated and confused.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,All Good just that it is not stable on updates I have tried several times on play store but it is not updating properly because of that maybe it crashes and all the previously working tabs are closed. I am using Chrome for a long time but this issue is not getting fixed from last 6 months. Please look into it as why it is not updating even when I click it shows and then nothing back to update option.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so disappointed that for a couple of weeks now Chrome on Android galaxy S8 freezes after only a few seconds and has to be closed. I've been a happy user of Chrome since it was introduced. I have tried everything but can't uninstall as it's bundled, have disabled and re enabled it but nothing has fixed it. I've had to install another browser as there's nothing else i can do. have sent crash reports, cleared cache. Thank you so much for rapid response. I have followed the link to clear cache - there are two icons for Chrome installed, one has the little orange circle bottom right which I think indicates it is a duplicate. They are both the same version, but take up different amounts of memory. The short cut I use takes me to the ""original"". I can't uninstall the duplicate as again, it can only be disabled. I have done this but it came back! Any ideas?"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The single most annoying thing that Chrome has recently started doing is prompting me to translate every single page. Even though I'm using English as my main and only langue it won't stop asking me to translate unless I manually turn off the feature. The spam detection, redirection and page loading is still terrible. And now worse still, spam ads can even use audio to further amplify the issue. Chrome is fast becoming a bloated, junk ridden browser, just waiting to collect more user data."

Until you do I am personally going to stop using the chrome browser and I will check back from time to time to see if this has been fixed.

I also get way too many ads, either reduce the amount or take ads out completely, or simply make the app run smoother and for the love of others, make the app actually not freeze every 10 seconds of opening it. Thank you, have a nice time."

At this point we know that both toolbar works. So can we not seriously just have the option to choose in settings already, is it seriously that hard to offer a choice?

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Infuriatingly garbage for what it SHOULD be. Constant bugs and crashes should not happen on a modern flagship phone with the latest tech. All sorts of tab issues. Slow. Doesn't load half the time even when on a great wifi connection and every other app is working fine. The worst is forcing us to use the browser how they think we should. Serial killers use grid tabs. C'mon man.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you switch to some other app after starting a download session in Chrome, chances for that downloading process to get corrupted are very high. Especially if the file is big. It just removes that file from the download list and pretends it never existed. Why can't it have a simple 'pause and resume' option for downloads like the other browsers? Also newer tab interfaces are messy. The user should have been provided with an option to choose from the older interfaces."

However, I hate that when you click on the link in the search bar, it completely erases it and only lets you copy it.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, it dosent let me update it for some reason, but after reading the comments I can conclude that's a good thing. Also links opening in new tabs are not a browser feature but how the programmer wanted you to open the tab, the websites you visited must not have included a target-blank attribute and therefore the new page replaces your tab. Otherwise it is a good search engine. Also some websites may not consider resizing, on websites errors are very often the fault of the developer(s)"

However, the browser is infamous for tracking what you do with it and using the data to produce personalized ads on web sites. For example, do an Amazon search and you may see ads for the product you just viewed on several sites. Google is also becoming very political and is pushing ideas we disagree with. For these reasons, most of us ditched Chrome. We now use browsers called Edge, Firefox and Brave. But Google has become too bold in what it does."

Images and other media content now take longer to load and play. Lastly i tried to provide developer feedback and sent a detailed email from the link here in the play store.

It's been a couple months and this was still a terrible decision. Update: now even worse with no duet and the entire bar and all options ONLY AT THE TOP. This is ridiculous for the size of modern phones! Why??
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really miss being able to scroll up and down through tabs where the majority of the page was not visible and several tabs fit on the screen. I now really want to use other apps rather than chrome since it makes changing tabs take longer and has less privacy if someone decides to look over my shoulder while changing between a couple tabs. I certainly won't update other devices so I don't lose the old function on all of them.

I just realized you can't turn off the grid mode (which I'm not a fan of) and I actually preferred the old tabs. Google knows my entire life.

The UI layout was fine as it was, now it just gets in the way while you're trying to browse, and also requires an unintuitive leap as every other browser (plus Chrome on PC) has the new tab button at the top right.

On my chromebook I am constantly forced to apply updates or everything just slows down & stalls out. It also has been adding a tab search ""feature"" in a terrible spot. Used to be able to disable it, not any more. Cannot even move it to a less obtrusive location. It is a ""feature"" I can find no use for, but have no choice but to have it in an idiotic location.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened in the latest update, but chrome had turned to complete garbage. It will say it's crashing even when it's working fine, and it will re-download pages that haven't changed in years (e.g. blog posts, etc), making you lose you place if you happen to put your phone down while reading something. It has just turned into unreliable garbage."

The size of the browser texts is not proportionate with the area the unused space the browser occupies. I don't like the constant changes in my links to apps and sites. There is no place that I can find for instructions on how to use what I've got.

What used to be a tidy stack of quickly-scannable titles now requires tedious scrolling though a miniature of every open page, which is annoying and unhelpful. And the auto-grouping obscures info further. As of latest update, I can no longer turn this ""feature"" off. For me, this renders the browser UN-usable. Now I need to switch to a different browser on all my devices. How fun."

You have a major bug in this one it needs to be fixed immediately. It is an obvious logical glitch.

Taking up page real estate with tab buttons is also a no-no. Bad enough we have no true full screen as is."

Thank goodness there's an undo button when I close the wrong tab. Talking of the undo button; I bet they remove it in the next update. Also the spacing between the tabs is also very annoying.

The new feature of grouping tabs is cumbersome. There is no way of opening tabs in new windows like in previous version.

I thought it was my former phone, but then I got another phone and it's still the same. And also auto play video ads on some website should be fixed!

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As others have stated, the last update seems to have broken the app. I have used chrome on phone and desktop for years and have never had any problems until recently. The app keeps freezing and crashing. I thought maybe it was just my phone but having read other recent reviews it's clearly an issue with the last update. Would be nice to see a fix issued a bit quicker, not like Google don't have the man power."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update, I can't type search terms in the address bar anymore. It takes me to a web page instead and tells me it's unavailable.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love Chrome on PC, but the mobile app is a pathetic piece of garbage. Ads take more real estate than web site content, and the ad hyperlink is 'conveniently' 100 times more sensitive to touch than the hyperlinks on the web page itself. YouTube video player is broken and randomly blacks out half the screen when changing orientation. Do yourself a favor and remove this trash web browser, and install Firefox instead."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The past few weeks nothing will load. The app quits randomly--even when I'm not actively using it. Then I read a review from another person who says the same thing, and the answer from Google is to check the internet connection? Whatever, Google! If your app doesnt work correctly, it MUST be the connection. I uninstalled the app and was able to complete my search immediately. So I guess uninstalling updates helped me connect to the internet? (update: reinstalled-same problem)"

The app doesn't even take load nowadays and at least crashes once or twice and y'all are adding unnecessary features making it more complicated to move from one tab to another. Can't y'all keep it simple and functional? Personally, I think everyone would prefer that anyways."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They seem intent on forcing you to use the grid layout for tabs. Personally I find the old cascading tabs so much easier to use both organisationally and physically ( one handed browsing). I don't tend to have more than a couple of tabs open at a time so tend to close tabs quite often, this adds an extra step that just gets on my nerves. I know some people prefer the grid layout but at least give us the option to choose what we prefer. Bring back the flags we could use to disable it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Chrome is a good app but I have to say I really like the beta version also so anything chrome gets 5 stars. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts.

I still would've used it without the last 2 updates, but now I can't even get on it at all. It was really slow now I just can't open ANY pages at all, maybe b/c I couldn't update?Anyhow, this has forced me to download an alternate browser as I NEED to get online to handle stuff. I'll try a few more times, but I like the new browser. PS Listen to ur customers b4 you don't have any"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would have given this 5 star if not for one thing that always happens to me. It is regarding about the ""Close all tabs"" option. My tabs have been all wiped clear for good twenty times now. Developers, I would like you to consider putting ""Yes"" or ""No"" confirmation after clicking the ""Close all tabs"". My phone is slow, or sometimes fast that leads me to accidentally clicking that option, which led to lost my important tabs. Please, do something about this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The had been one of the most used apps I have in a time. But with the new update(s) it's so hard to search up a website without getting either a black screen or without chrome crashing. I found out the solution is just to update it but even after updating the app, disable/enable it still is constantly crashing. I tried so many things (Eg: Clearing all my tabs, clearing cache) but none of them work. So annoying."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update, including phone updating to Android 12, Chrome has been acting crazy. Videos continue to play even after going into apps and force stopping it. Froze up a few times, opened again, and all my windows were gone, then all of a sudden, they all came back after opening and closing it a few times. Trying to full screen videos is a joke. Video gets pushed off to a corner and only see a tiny bit, but it's in full screen, so the rest of the screen is black."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,From 5 stars to 1. I have stopped using Chrome after more than a decade because of the AI results. I found a way to disable them on the website but not the app. I now use Opera which does everything I want.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like others, a recent update has caused my phone to become very unresponsive when using Chrome. It isn't that great of a phone to begin with anymore (Moto g6) but still it's been great for me for the past year and a half or so. On the upside, I installed Firefox, which no doubt will be better in many ways. Looking forward to an update that fixes Chrome, though."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very great and accurate browser although the only problem I have with it is if I'm downloading a file or something like that, it would sometimes stop downloading. Another problem with the download feature is that we cannot go back to the refence site of source if the download fails or stops. Please try fixing that ? 🙂 Otherwise it's a really great and efficient browser app"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad as of late. It won't let me close tabs. Everytime I close one, it freezes. Can't load the already open tabs because they white screen and freeze. When I re-open, it has the tab I closed or opened twice. I have 50 tabs that won't load. When I close all tabs, it adds the 6 initial tabs I had, added to the list of tabs. This has happened before and uninstalling and re-installing works but there has to be a better way."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The current version (77.0.3865.92) is seriously broken. If I want to select text in a text input field by double tapping on a word, the whole page will be ridiculously zoomed, and when I pinch-out zoom back, the page becomes unusable (links don't work, page elements remain partially rendered, etc..), and has to be reloaded. And a general comment: it is __EXTREMELY__ annoying, that Google itself, the inventor and brain behind Google Play and Chrome, doesn't take a minimal effort to comment new versions, beyond the meaningless ""stability and performance enhancements"", at least mentioning the major corrections, etc.."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update changed the background colour of the tab screen from black to white! For no good reason and it's an eye sore and waste of battery. Additionally, the new tab page that shows all the recent page icons has needlessly shrunk the icons and put them in useless grey circles, making them harder to see! They're smaller and the circles add zero functionality and actually make it uglier. Why?!! Why are you trying to ruin Chrome?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Same thing happening again. Really annoying to have to go through all these contortions to update it every time. Can't get it to update. I click on the update button, get the little spinning thing for a second and then the update button reappears and nothing happens. Additionally, when using the email given to contact developers, I received a message saying the email is no longer monitored.

I don't know what's causing this issue, but it's enough of a nuisance to really annoy me, since it's never happened before. I don't like to have sync turned on, so every time this happens, all my data disappears for good. This has happened 4 times in 4 months, and if it becomes a regular occurrence, I won't hesitate to drop Chrome browser."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Chrome has automatically taken an update which is still showing pending for the last 1 hour and it is also not allowing to cancel or stop the update. This is not allowing any other applications to take an update. I been using Chrome for all my activities till now. It seems I have change my browser. Really disappointed with Google.

It has always worked for its intended purpose, even at times when my phone itself is acting strange due to storage issues, which is great. I just wanted to mention though, that the ""Fast and Secure"" part of the title makes it look really shady, like it's not fast and secure. That's just opinion and minor nitpicks though. Overall, great browser."

Yes, you read that correctly. After hours of searching for answers I gave up, because this is the only fix that works. Google Drive flips to offline mode upon opening, when viewed in Google Chrome. In Edge, it stays online and works perfectly. What a world. Online many users have same issue. Google, come on. That's embarrassing."

I love how you can link all your bookmarks, history, etc from desktop to desktop to phone and etc. Definitely a great product.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just because of the security and syncing with all my devices; then the lite; but the problem of abrupt closing without any indication is a nuisance. All the same; I believe that your devs are doing a great job, it's never easy to do these things perfectly, but what matters is that you give your best's best. The app closes itself unexpectedly; what a worse experience!"

It's not my internet either. 🤦‍♀️"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stupid useless changes to the UI forced on the user with new updates and no options offered to toggle them on or off. This is especially true for the forced grid layout and grouping of opened tabs. The grid layout is 100% trash, and now that Google has forced this change, while purposely preventing any workaround, the trash is exactly where this app is going. A lot of other reviewers are hoping Google will listen to us and fix it, lol. My advice to everyone: Chrome-to-trash ASAP and switch."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, the only redeeming quality of Google Chrome is dark mode, and you have to go into flags to enable it. It's been how many years, and they haven't coded in holding and dragging tabs from one place to another? Also, the asinine pull-to-refresh feature always works by accident, as when the address bar is hidden, then shown, it, sometimes, registers as ""oh, you're at the top, you're trying to swipe down, not refresh? Too bad. To make matters worse, the flag for disabling refresh is gone."

I tried uninstalling updates of that (and disabling it) and Chrome STILL won't stay open so I'm not sure what the problem is here.

I used it for 2 minutes and my battery was drained 10% and if i leave it idle on my phone within a few hours my battery dies. That's with nothing else running and battery saver on! I'm going to have to try a different browser for a while cause I don't like having to charge my phone every few hours just to use Chrome on it. Hopefully this helps let folks know something is up and to keep track of the app's power draw so they don't find themselves with a sudden dead battery out of nowhere. Good luck!"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app altogether is probably the best app to search for anything with BUT the only thing I don't like about it is the chrome lite mode because it always makes it physically impossible to search anything without the page saying, ""this tab used to much internet"" and it makes chrome very hard to deal with and I would appreciate it if you could toggle it"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Google, If your browser stops a pop-up from showing on a website maybe not tell me via a pop-up. Maybe just don't do anything and just block it. Seems kinda silly to tell me it blocked something by means of the thing it blocked."

This started when I was prompted to select a default internet connection, and after dismissing it a few times, I chose Chrome. Disabling the Chrome app seemed to stop it initially, but after updating Chrome, things seemed fine until today when I was redirected again upon opening my phone. I've disabled Chrome once more. need this fixed"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It usually works well but I have a Nokia 2V but I think the Lite mode is on EVEN THOUGH I SPECIFICALLY MADE SURE I TURNED IT OFF. It keeps doing that stupid ""chrome removed some content cause the page was taking too much data"" thing. And it basically slows my phone down. It's annoying when I never gave chrome permission to do that in the first place"

Main reason is extensions, I know Google's main source of income is ad revenue and can't allow us to block ads. So I've to move on.

It just has an update button that sometimes I can push and sometimes I can't. Even when it lets me hit the update button, the app just buffers the entire time waiting to update. When Chrome is open, my more tab is just the red update arrow saying I have an update available and its been this way for months. Why can't I update and be disappointed like everyone else?"

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New tabs is utter garbage. Google seem to have a policy of updating chrome several times a month just for the sake of it, adding tired and broken 'features' no-one wants. Every update chrome becomes less and less intuitive, more cluttered, slower, unstable, crashing and bloated. What happened to the super lightweight, fast browser we used to love?

Starting with the swipe gestures to navigate through page history, which are REALLY annoying when there are websites with side-menus that you need to swipe to open, now the same thing is happening with tab grouping. chrome://flags was the only way to disable these two, but over time they get removed because toggling them on/off is ""experimental"".

Intentionally poor privacy, forms and history controls, and unnecessarily slow if it detects adblock/uorigin plugins. Google makes you think you are in control of your data, when in fact they cleverly make it impossible to use Chrome effectively AND have privacy."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a dedicated Chrome user for almost 10 years, it may be time to change browsers. This update is the WORST. Layout has been changed to grid structure where I can no longer change the order of the tabs (when the app updated, my tabs were not kept in the same order) without creating groups (which I don't want); pages refuse to load and the app will close itself after 5+ minutes of waiting; all of my saved log-in information is now gone; you have no option to see picture quality before downloads."

Since updating my phone has went crazy and the screen and keyboard have became erratic - I know it sounds stupid but when I uninstalled all chrome updates and reverted back to basic everything has went back to normal. Google - you are freaking useless. Fix the issues.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The updates seem to be too much trouble for me. Simplify and secure. Having to change and figure out things after every update?

As soon as you start the 3rd download, two out if three downloads get cancelled. If you are unlucky enough, it shows download error with those two and you have to revisit the site to download them from the scratch. Really, worst update ever."

But I have a few chrome windows open for reference so I would navigate those through the tab at the top where it would drop down the windows that were open. Yesterday it changed. Google chrome kept freezing when I would click on my tabs. Then say it wasn't responding. So I'd close it. Now when I click on the tabs it takes ages and lays them all out on the page. It's a hassle and takes up so much more time. Is this a new feature or have I done something?

"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So I'm not sure why but my Google font changed without any notice or permission like couple of months ago it was lighter version of whatever I had the first time and I liked the change. But like it changed back and it deeply upsets me that I can't figure out how to change it to the lighter version😔
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've used Chrome for year on pc and then mobile as it's my preferred browser. For some reason what used to be a small fast programme is going the way Microsoft products. Not all mobiles have lots of memory to utilise. The bigger the software is, it seems the slower they become. Please stop relying on people having the most up to date mobiles, it slows them down too."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is still a great and very fast browsing app, but the new layout is very irritating. There's now a huge bar at the bottom of the screen that i can't get rid of which often blocks lower parts of web pages that i can't get to. What was wrong with having a small drop down menu in the top corner? This feels like yet another app changing a perfectly good UI simply because they feel like they should, while completely disregarding the user experience."

UPDATE it now has been saying ""installing"" and thinking for 5 min or longer work no progress."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure why everyone is complaining about the tab grids! I loved this feature on my google app, it allowed for such each access to find everything and sort all different things I was viewing into one. However, suddenly, I no longer have access to this feature so all of my grouped tabs were dispersed into the old style, flooding my tab feed and making it impossible to find the certain tabs I was looking for. Dissapointed but I hope they re-enable this feature again!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I once got an adware virus (which I know is my fault completely) which worked purely through Chrome, I had hoped I would be able to uninstall it and just use Kiwi Browser or something similar but for whatever reason, on a non Google branded phone, it is treated as a system app that cannot be uninstalled for whatever reason. Only thing I can do is uninstall all the updates which is worthless to do considering it still pops up randomly"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Awful. The change to a tab list instead of the tab windows is disgusting. I don't want to look at walls of texts, especially when dealing with multiple articles in the same website. I am switching from the once amazing chrome experience to Mozilla Firefox. If you have to ask for feedback or recommend a suggestion on something the majority don't want, and ignore the features you have wanted, you relise this product is not for you. Joining the Firefox community was surprisingly wonderful!"

PlayStore and Google functionality on this phone has been completely side channeled and now there are insane permissions and a work account lockout on here.

This isn't an internet problem neither a phone one, as other pages loaded fine. I uninstalled various times, even restarted my phone- nothing works. Might be switching to Opera soon."

The file is located in SD card/android/data/com.android.chrome/files/download. Would be better if location is customizable or at least at the root directory like for local storage. Also, since it's impossible to have download managers integrated into chrome, a built in system to sort downloads based on file time is more than welcomed."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoyed using Chrome, especially with the compatibility with other devices and the way it synchronizes your information. However, the latest update to tab switching and opening is absolutely terrible and after many years of using Chrome they have forced me to use another browser. Really a shame, the other features are all amazing and the way tabs worked before was really nice and smooth."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App works reliably and as intended. No faults there. Chrome has typically my browser of choice for years. Unfortunately, on mobile, there are just a ton of ads and video ads that annihilate my battery. Even with maximum privacy/ad settings, they are everywhere. It finally got frustrating enough that I made a change. If you're on mobile, do yourself a favor and get Firefox + Ghostery/Adblocker. No ads, and a much better browsing experience."

You started reading an article, opened it in a tab, then after sometime came back to finish reading? None of the links will work on that page, because guess what? This MF changed the page mode to offline (your are welcome). Didn't ask you if you need it. And you CAN'T turn it off. The most annoying feature ever. Get rid off it please."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason the app is a blinding bright white now, and I can't change the app or revert it to an earlier version like I used to be able to. Thanks, I hate it. Edit: I don't WANT ""reading mode,"" ""simplified view,"" or whatever you want to call it. Chrome used to have a black background when opening new tabs. Now it's white and it hurts my eyes. Give me the option to change it, or at least let me uninstall this awful update."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Chrome won't allow me to update. It has been buggy and slow the last week or so. What's going on Chrome? I use it on all my devices and haven't had issues until recently. Seriously concerned as so much of what i do is using Google apps from backups for both personal and work, kids school... disappointed. In seeing I'm not the only one with issues. Help us resolve this Google! 10/5/20 edit... still can't update, but tells me I need to. 11/3/20 edit... still won't let me update."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While it is functional to view websites, the change on the news feed implementation makes this my least preferred browser. Old implementation, you could swipe the story off the news feed. Current implementation, you have to touch the 3 dots, find the most relevant option, and click that. Because stories come back up pretty much no matter what it seems, I'm doing more work to discard a story temporarily and end up with a long list of stories. Thus, chrome no longer meets my needs."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nothing but ongoing problems. Yes, I've cleared the data / cache, uninstalled and reinstalled app again... Stop telling everyone to do this when you need to do maintenance on your end to fix and solve the many bug issues and glitches allowing malware and virus to try to invade devices, which my Antivirus has caught, but leaves me wondering what is actually get through... on top of very unreliable and unworkable app. Lack of better words... Google and this App SUCKS!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent tab grouping is terrible and a pain to use. Plus there's something completely wrong with the app. When typing in a page, I'll randomly get switched back to the previous webpage. The app constantly freezes. The highlight/select feature does not work. Often the cursor will disappear, and trying to type anything in a web page is so buggy. It was fine before, why did they make everything worse?"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've used chrome for years but I don't know what happened with the last few updates... He constantly freezes or won't open and if I try to search for something half the time it just turns black or grey. I hate to say it but it had to resort to using Samsung internet browser so I have something that consistently works. I really hope somebody pulls their head out of their ass and gets this fixed because I'd like to go back to something that I'm used to and not something I'm forced to use.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update: working much better now! Decent web browsing app, but a large part of why I try to use it is because it syncs with chrome on my computer. Unfortunately, this feature has never worked consistently--whether there is a sync error, it loads continuously without ever actually loading, it doesn't sync at all (even though it says it does), or it syncs old bookmarks (ones that I had deleted) back to my compute, this app is more trouble than it's worth."

The moment I was going to undo it, the button disappeared. It's frustrating that only those viewed tabs can be recovered, why not all of it? I hope there's an alternative solution to this.😭"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since Chrome took away the option to stop video auto-play ads (Media setting) it's definitely time for a full boycott of Chrome. Firefox let's you stop automatic video play. There's no reason to keep using a browser that makes you dizzy from so much visual pollution when there are alternatives. If enough people abandon Chrome then they will be forced to bring the media control option back. There's no need for loyalty to a product that's annoying. Let's all boycott Chrome now to force their hand!
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but I think you guys should fix something about your browser. I will be in the middle of downloading a file and then my data maybe goes off, maybe a call enters my phone or something even a flash and then instead of the file to pause it will just fail automatically, I have lost tons of files because of this action. Honestly speaking this is the only issue I and a bunch of friends complain about. It would be amazing if you guys update that feature."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Tab layout is straight up trash. Also, whenever I update chrome through play store, it always pauses at 97% and never gets to 100% completion no matter how many times I try. And this happens only when I update this app, not with others. Thank you for this; the person-in-charge neither knows what google users expect from new updates nor does he care about users' opinions, ultimately leaving me no choice but to never update this app."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Been using the chrome browser for a long time. But tab grouping has made switching between the various pages I have open a pain. I used Google's flags to disable tab grouping but some update seems to have made that not work either. The best solution I have found was to install an older version by searching for a January apk online and turning off auto update. I care more about tab grouping being removed than security I guess.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No support for extensions. Removal of ability to disable video autoplay is a deal breaker. This affects almost all other web browsers too as most are Chromium clones. I hate random web videos wasting my data, and if you set it to auto mute you might not even know they're playing. Even the new Firefox is better than this."

It's incredibly annoying when I tap on something on a page, which turns out to be a PDF link, and Chrome just begins downloading it without asking, no matter how big the file is, or whether I'm not on wi-fi. Not cool, and throws all safety measures out of the window."

For one, the feature called ""Hey Google"" loves to turn on randomly in the middle of the night, which scares the living heck out of me. Secondly, the browser itself is poorly managed and/or secured. I find myself always getting annoying, scummy pop-ups talking about how I won a thousand dollars... On the contrary, the platform runs smoothly and it's AI interface is just amazing!"

On PC and Mac, it's a memory hog if you don't manage your tabs. On mobile devices its perfect (for me atleast). I would love to have a built in programmer notepad within inspector. THAT WOULD BE SUPER AWESOME!! It would make testing code even easier! One could do it all from Chrome or integrate visual studio code into Chrome without extensions.

New bugs in the browser are causing the app to force stop almost 100% of every time it's utilized and has become very tedious. Please fix this as soon as possible so people can access to this more frequently without any crashes. Thank you."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Show original page because some content have been removed"" breaks most web sites functionality. There should be an option to opt out of it. Autofill password is very annoying as it doesn't get out of the way. There should be option to close it once you don't need it. Nowadays, it keeps coming back and covering everything after swiping it away, it just changes position. The key icon should be enough to disable or enable it."

To add to it, I know its not my phone, which was my original thought process, but the app itself as I have noticed many complaining of the same issues.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Taking away things that are very important to a minority (but still objectively large number) of users seems to be Google's MO at this point. In my case (and others, as I've found by skimming recent reviews), it's the ability to move the most used buttons to the bottom of the screen. Not only do I strongly believe that setup would be better default UX experience, but it should be an easy setting to change (instead of having to enable ""experimental"" features). Now it's gone altogether."

The one downside, as seems to be the case with most of the Google made and or powered Android apps, is the huge file sizes these apps have causing the internal storage on a lot of lower end phones very tight. Not all phones come with massive internal storage. Just my thoughts. Peace."

Completely unnecessary and make it user unfriendly to use. Switched to one of your major competitors because this is absolutely useless now. Nice one Google. Fixing something that wasn't broken but now is in extremis. And you still need to reduce the size of your ads because they dominate screen space leaving only a quarter visible."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new tabs system is so much worse. Before you could see 10 or so tabs all at once, maximising space, making life quicker, less scrolling, less gestures. Now you can only see three at a time, all tiny little squares. Seems less user friendly and just bloats the user experience. The layout is nice, but is better kept for the home page. There's already a home button. Leave the home button to go there, but make the tabs button view the tabs. It's redundant to have both go to same page."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It has been my go to web browser for years. However the fact that you are forced to have grouped tabs these days makes it useless once you have a few tabs open as you can absolutely never find first the group then the tab you want.

As it seems many other people are complaining, both the frequency of updates, and numerous problems brought to the platform with each one, are way too high.

In google news it shows loading icon at bottom and dont show full result. When I do pinch to zoom in any website then I cannot span the zoom area with single finger. I have to zoom out and then again zoom in to view that area. The biggest problem is page loading and hang.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Annoying. Just one word to express it. This new update is just frustrating. I don't understand who in Google thought this was a good idea, but this new tab system is horrible. I'm using a Web Browser, NOT a file organizer. There is literally no point to tiled tabs and grouping multiple tabs of the same site. It's absolute hell to navigate through and even worse to get rid of when you get pop-up ad tabs. The ads group instead of staying in a seperate tab. GIVE US THE OLD UPDATE BACK."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I loved Chrome until 5-6 months ago when a message flashes saying that an update was required! Now I am still trying to update the stupid app! I can't get it to pass the pending stage. I have another web browser that is also pending yet never updates.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Honestly skeptical to download based on reviews. I did it. It seems ok. The refresh button is still there. I downloaded yesterday. So far so good. Not sure why they want to copy apple so much. update 10/24/2019 Several phones and multiple chrome updates later the app seems more buggy and requires FREQUENT updates with nothing really appearing changed imo. If U could have a phone (excluding apple) w/o google or any of it's counterparts that would b great. Google seems like A LOT of bloat ware.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since last update, 1. The crashing problem occurred during use. Too many time chome was crash. 2.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extension and add-on support are a requirement if you actually consider your browser a safe, competitive alternative. Additionally, your browser's language detection sucks. You need to provide a way to manually activate it. The worst offense is that your browser has poor desktop mode handling. Browsing certain pages in Chrome is impossible because the website's mobile side is so badly written... Not being able to escape to the desktop version like it is supposed to is useless."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"previous updates for the app have been good so far i could browse the internet without any break of sweat, but unfortunately, the latest update has created a new problem for me, probably has for the others as well, the problem is that whenever I'm in the middle of something, it just suddenly crashes, my device which is S8 doesn't seem to have any problem. this has never happened before.. the app is likely to have an issue. hopefully, it gets fixed soon."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good. I like the UI and speed of the app, and most of all the sync to Desktop feature. however, with all the $$$ available to pour into Chrome, and it being the native app for Android, I would like easier methods to reach frequently used features like clearing history (as w/Firefox) and better use of memory for performance. Worse thing is i can't even scroll when searching for active Gif's as it freezes constantly. I use a 2018 Android phone with 6GB of mem, should not be happening."

Any while I am typing it's still using my data very very quickly as I just did a top up plan of 10 gb and I am tracking it. I might uninstall this app to stop my data being robbed. Carefull guys."

I'm still hopeful! Update: not response and the issues continue. Time to uninstall Chtome and go with something else. Firefox seems to work great! Maybe other options out there as well. Goodbye chrome."

This app is so broken it literally will not function even after doing the typically recommended ""uninstall and reinstall""."

I also cannot uninstall the app (in the hopes that I could reinstall it.) So, I'm stuck with an older version of chrome that I cannot do anything with.

The whole tab-grid tile view is super annoying AND NOT USER FRIENDLY versus the original single page cars file view , which was easier to manage with one hand. I don't want to have to use 2 hands to browse pages while on my phone, just 1 hand is fine.

I have been an avid Chrome user since the Alpha testing and have looked forward to the day I could download Chrome on my third and final (at this time) device, my mobile smart phone. With Chrome for mobile devices only being available for download on the latrst versions of Android, I was unable to utilize this app on my LG OPTIMUS V, however, now, as the owner of a new HTC EVO V 4G from Virgin Mobile I have been able to complete my intuitive Chrome collection...

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The news feed option, which is the main reason I use this, has been steadily getting more and more unintuitive. The new option to not hear from certain topics or news sources is great, but for everything else, they should bring back the old news feed, with articles you can discard with just a swipe and the ability to summon new ones instead of being stuck with the same until Chrome decides it wants to give you new ones. IT must stop trying to reinvent the wheel."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This must the the 15th time I tried loading the app, but it is still pending, it never completes. The last time I tried it was trying to load for over an hour. I shut it off, then restarted my phone, it still won't work. It is annoying because the Google Chrome app still harrasses me to update it. I would if I could."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm using DDG as my default search engine because f*** GoogleWebLight, and whoever decided it was a good idea to not give us the option to turn it off. I am also considering simply switching browsers, because this s*** refuses to acknowledge it even when I'm on a fast network and just loves giving me ugly, messy versions of pages. It tries to optimise Wikipedia for crying out loud! And when it does you can't even open the subtitles to actually read the page. Fix this."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Compared to the difficulties and viruses in browsers back in the days of Windows XP, Google Chrome on an Android Phone is a completely carefree life. Any Android phone with 16 GB internal memory will allow you to have twenty tabs open simultaneously, without that diminishing performance at all. Since I began using Google browser w/Android, I have not had a virus and have not had to reformat my phone due to any browser issues. I highly reccommend this browser experience."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what has happened, but lately I have not been able to click links after a search and I am only able to scroll so far on most pages, so I'm not able to see all the content. Until this is fixed I am unfortunately going to have to use another browser, which is not what I really want to do, since Chrome is my #1. Yes I've cleaned the cache, cookies, history, and even uninstalled and reinstalled."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Chrome works great. Fast, snappy and reliable. Only one problem, sometimes when opening the app, I type in a search or website and press enter, and nothing happens, the enter button has no response. I need to close the app and open it again and it works fine again. Happens about once a day, isn't a deal breaker obviously but is hopefully fixed"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Takes up a lot of ram, but that's a web browser for you. Sometimes it can't play videos properly, and I get error if I try to skip to a further point, and I have to switch to dolphin for a second to watch that video, that's why it's only 4 stars Edit: no longer experiencing video issues. Updated to 5"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"March 23 2021. I'm supposed to update this app on my android but it won't let me update it. I've made sure i have data access and reset my phone several times to see if anything will work. I have been trying to fix this problem for over 24 hours now, with no support help. I haven't been able to get any online access or check my email. Horrible experience!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible after group tabs update. The tabs concept itself is fine, i can see how it comes in handy. It has however (not sure if the tabs function is causing this) pretty much rendered my Google page usage impossible. Page constantly becomes the ""aw snap"" error message, sometimes while scrolling but almost always if I click on a link from the Google search results. Do not have this issue with any other websites, just anything from Google (including articles/sites i click on the link from Google)"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Getting fairly consistent crashes which cause me to lose all my open tabs. Also it takes 5-6 attempts for chrome to download an image to my phone. No error, just doesn't show up in my library until i try downloading again. When it works it's great, but these issues make it extremely frustrating to use"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi guys, here's a tip for those - users- facing problem(s) with the new update and wanting to fix it. I tried it and it worked and I hope it'll work for you guys as well. First, go to your phone's Settings>>Apps & Notifications (see all apps), you'll then look for Chrome and tap on it, after that, on the top-right corner of your screen, you'll see a menu (usually three vertical dots), tap on it and there's an option to uninstall updates, do it. I hope you find this helpful. Cheers 😉"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 Star Edit: I charged my phone and turned it on as usual only today it all of a sudden has my chrome website bookmarks saved to my home screen simply disappeared! There are just empty spaces where they used to be! I did NOT install an update. My phone has TONS of memory left. There is NO reason this should have happened! Google/Android /Chrome, get it together! I go looking and this has happened to a LOT of other Android users! I NEED MY HOME SCREEN BOOKMARKS BACK!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tbh, considering how wonky it's behaving right now, I would've given a much lower rating if not that it functions properly on a norm. It's not allowing me to update it, idk why. Then the app keeps closing, it freezes, it's not loading any results, doesn't load when I press all tabs and thus, the other tabs too aren't loading. It's been a huge inconvenience today and whatever is messing up, pls just get it fixed like honestly"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Chrome is getting worse day by day. It may force me to stop using this browser completely. It does not update. I could not even uninstall it. The news in the morning are terrible in the discovery section. It comes in Bengali. And there is no way to change the language in English. The choice of news is terrible too. The way tabs open is way to inconvenient for anybody. I might stop using it soon.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated review - Chrome is fast and overall works great. Things I would like to see updated: -Please bring the ""new tab"" button and the rest of the controls to the bottom of the app for easier access. -I would like to see details of background data consumption. At close to 6GB in a past month in background consumption Im curious what is using all my data."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Chrome is refreshing some of the pages automatically such as Google forms which is creating a loss of data and problem. This is the problem which I am facing from this month (September). I found this problem first time even after using this browser since 2016 October. But now I have to change my browser i hope Chrome will fix the issue soon. I then I will again.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and FASTER. I love chrome! it's the only search engine i use and I've never had a problem whatsoever since i began using it almost 8 years ago and i will continue to use it for years to come as long as its available...I am extremely happy and only have awesome things to say about chrome"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything was fine, but people need the illusion of progress so you release updates, in which functionality doesnt seem important. Great idea! Lets destroy the way tabs used to work, not an improvement, but at least its an update! Rant complete. Chrome is awesome, but it was awesome a whole ago, and then it gets changed. Dont change what isnt broken people. Android OS could take this onboard too. Now we are all forced to look at horrid orange in text messages... for what!? Ok rant actually complete."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad downloading speed it has . I just install another browser for it's low download speed.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new all white screen is blinding! Too bright and it also makes it difficult to discern between opened tabs. Hate the new look! I have a dark theme on my phone and now dread opening chrome. I uninstalled and disabled auto update. I'll check back here for comments to see if you add the option to go dark. In the meantime, I'll investigate other browsers."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 26th May 2021: thanks for choosing Chrome? I can't update it, I can't uninstall it from my phone, I don't like it, the worst kind of bloatware: Slow. ----- I hate the new appearance and the fact that it's heavier every time I update it. If it continues like this I will freeze the hell out of it and never use it again. Going Firefox or Dolphin."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this makes me really angry, I have had this app for as long as I can remember and just now it is starting to give me a bunch of pop-up ads even when I'm not even on it. If I'm on a different app it'll gave me an ad in the middle of whatever I'm doing or even if I'm on my home screen it is very annoying and I have tried to stop it but it hasn't worked obviously if you could please fix this I would greatly appreciate it otherwise that is the only problem."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a Google die-hard for years, but recently chrome has been so frustrating to use I'm about ready to switch browsers. On mobile, everytime I touch the search bar to edit my search, it crashes. On my laptop I can't click on/use any search suggestions. I've updated, uninstalled/re-installed, even factory reset my phone/computer with no changes. WTH Google??"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"cannot browse at all. sometimes when i open the app, it does not fully load (like tabs button, and the 3 dots) and whenever i search up something the bar freezes at 10% forever. when i go to tabs nothing appears but it says the amount of tabs i have open. if i open an incognito tab usually nothing loads and same thing happens. most of the times i cannot close incognito tabs, causing the 'close incognito tabs' notification to stay for long, no matter what. its completely unusable at this point"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's getting worst... I can neither be able to update it nor uninstalling it... And every time I search something it shows me a update red flag in top right corner. When I click on it, it takes me to Google play store and there when I click on update button it dance for a half second and then return to normal state...means not updated. I can't understand what's going wrong there. Why Google developers are not replying to me??"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app seriously and I think it really helps me to do what I want to do especially the grid something, but it is suddenly gone and everything in my chrome tab are in a mess. I don't feel like using it anymore if it will not make a come back. I really think that grid option really helps me to organize my tabs and to find what site I left off and everything, knowing that you just disabled it and now everything comes back to the way it was before... I was just dissapointed and devastated."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unconstitutional permissions read all of Google requires for you to use. It's crazy why would a game require accessing your files contact list or photos or be aloud to record audio and video recordings ,but they do it if your on your device or not .makes no difference ck audio and video recordings on your dashboard, read permissions on page 2 page one select the top rt corner three dots click on it and not one of the permissions on the 2nd page can be denied . You have given up ur rights"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love Chrome but they switched my tab layout to grid formation multiple times and I kept having to change it back. Now I can't fix it and it's awful. The old way I could read the top of the tab to see what was on each page but now they're just tiny squares with tiny writing and I have to click every one to find the page I was looking for. I hate the groups too because it just adds more clicking to get to stuff. If I wanted groups I had folders in the bookmarks section for that.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is something I always use for keeping tabs on my school work and my personal work, but recently the experience is getting bad. I usually multitask writing while listening to the article being read to me but that feature is now something to pay for, the app freezes, and some sites/articles are not opening, it redirects to diff. sites and/or apps, and it is also getting harder to navigate. This is a feedback, answer properly and not use an automatic replyer to tell us to rewrite this!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It has some issues with connectivity and video streaming. This problem goes away after a reboot though. Some times it takes time to produce the search results and stream videos while other apps like YouTube are just doing fine. I have 15GB memory available with atleast 1GB RAM free most of the time.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst experience I ever had. Usually, I have a slow internet connection as I was living in remote area. So, sometimes, the network may go down for a while. I have tried to download some files of 12 gb from my Google Drive. But the disadvantage with chrome is, if the network goes down, it will just won't store anything even if the file was downloaded more than half. But, when I used Microsoft edge,when network goes down and reconnects, it will just continue from where it has stopped."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a 5 star app but the whole group tab thing is so obnoxious and unhelpful. It's slow and clumsy to just switch tabs now and It's buggy, too! The amount of times that awkward tab selection bar at the bottom of the screen appears and then refuses to disappear is unreasonable. It stays up even if you fullscreen something else on the site you're on. And scrolling down doesn't always work, either. Worst part is there's no way to turn this ""feature"" off. Rollback or replace this update!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Second to None for this app, and as always with Google; very user-friendly, tech savvy, and appealing to the minimalist, the simplist and the modernist. I'm always on the lookout for the best & brightest product and deal, and it's been my experience that some very few out-match Google in terms of product, performance and support. Thanks you Guys & Gals, for all that you do for us. And please trust me when I say it does not go by unnoticed~"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"what the heck did you do with this recent update?!?! search results are horrific, you try to package images, videos, and only news articles all on the first page of results, not to mention the accuracy of searches has gone down the hole as well. I just spent over 10 minutes trying to Google ""what rattlesnakes are found in arizona"" and was only receiving results from news articles about what to do if bitten and when rattlesnake season is. had to log on to my desktop just to get the damn answer,17"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand what has happened with this app, I am not able to update it. It's just not responding to the update option in the play Store. In the app it shows a new update is available but clicking it redirects to the play Store where it can't be updated. Google needs to fix this problem soon. Since it was not updating I deleted all of its existing updates so that I can start updating it from scratch. But even like that it does not allow me to update. And this happens from a long back."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A tab grouping option was recently strong armed onto users of this app, which replaces the efficient cascading method of having multiple pages open, to having them divided into separate folder/windows you click on. While you can see there were attempts to make the app group them logically, it all just ends up feeling held together by a wing and a prayer of an Atheist. Until it's removed I'm keeping this at one star; there aren't enough words in any language to aptly describe how bad it is."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favorite browser!!! Very dependable and overall easy to use!! ...however, it needs more organization options...and also, the help center is not very detail oriented. These are not complaints....just suggestions for improvement because I know Google is THE BEST & the sky is the limit so my expectations for you are certainly high and that's definitely a compliment!!! I love Google chrome!!!!!!"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Though a lot of people has been complaining about the grouped tab and the likes, I find the update and development wonderful. I open a lot of tabs and sometimes keeping track could be a heck of a problem.. Bit this update has that fixed and even view my tabs in grids has made a lot easier. We all have preferences but this is a bomb👌"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chrome version 93 IS STILL using an internal dns resolver. The setting ""Turn Off Secure DNS"" has nooooooooooo effect (maybe bug or broken feature??). My phone's default Chrome ver.77 (and it's Webview) uses DNS normally like everyone else, therefore I can have the option to personally reject unsafe\unwanted websites blocklisted at my Android's firewall."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Worked fine until it started crashing on Android. Now have to use a different browser to connect to WiFi networks, open web links - including from Google News - or upload photos. Chrome fails to do any of this most of the time. Clearing the cache makes no difference, and the preinstalled version can't be uninstalled, so can't reinstall it."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Again all of my tabs have been deleted upon updating to the newest version. Regardless of whether you sync the app to your account you won't be able to recover any tabs at all. It's pretty annoying having again to experience this issue that has never been addressed nor resolved. Do fix it as it's been years that the same problem has persisted, it'll decrease low ratings & pissed off users."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Losing my patience. Chrome is the ONLY browser I use, even on my Windows laptop. However, the recent updates on my phone are bad. The app crashes, even on my SD855 regularly. The most recent (I'd updated on 28th July) is the WORST. I'll give this app few more chances, then I'm moving on to Firefox if it doesn't improve. I'm losing my patience."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The application keeps automatically updating and being re-enabled without my intervention. As I choose to use another browser, I cant even save myself some storage space because of this. Not sure why it keeps enabling or why the Play Store keeps auto updating when its turned off. Next device I am giving Apple a closer look."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Does not allow me to view webpages correctly, it does not load them unless I hit refresh at least once per page. The times that it does allow me to view them, if I hit the halfway down mark all the content dissapears and I can only see the backround. When this happens, it does not allow me to scroll back up and refresh, I mush go back to the previous page via other means to try to reopen again. Previous update was better for the Razr-I"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate that the latest update forced use of the new grid tab view and won't allow reverting to the old cascade view. The grid is just too small to scan quickly. Also opening a new tab now forces you to enter something into the search bar. Can't go directly to bookmarks or a most visited site. Exiting the text entry just closes the tab. This is very frustrating and non-intuitive to me. Stop making such drastic changes to the interface to the point where I feel like I have to relearn the app.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was beautiful and now it's trash. Aug.25.2020 Figured out its crashing when its trying to bring back up more than a single page/tab. You can't do anything about the multiple tabs either because any of those actions ALSO causes the app to crash. But hey, at least that crash lets you ""send feedback"".. I'm at a loss. Nov.04.2020"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like many, many others here, I've experienced crashing, freezing and laggy performance for the last few months. Each new update has gotten worse and worse for me to the point i uninstalled all chrome updates and went back to the original version that was installed on my phone. Unfortunately, I lose dark mode, but its a small price to pay for stability. The first thing I tried was turning off sync and clearing cache and data but none of that works. The problem is something in the app itself."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent update broke Chrome. Whole screen turns white, except the icons along the top like signal strength etc and the three buttons along the very bottom. The back button does nothing. Lets popups happen and then claims they were blocked. When I try and use a bookmark link for startpage to open the browser it locks up completely. Funny how it doesn't do that as long as I'm searching with Google. Update... Now blocking some popups."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok for the most part but like others have stated my app keeps telling me to update...even though I have it on automhatic updates. I hit the update button, the little swirly thing pops up for a few seconds, then it's as if I never pressed update. Other than that I haven't had any major issues. Seems to function as it always has."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every single update makes this app worse and worse. The new download view is absolute rubbish! Which idiotic, pea-brained moron thought that having less than 2 downloads visible at a time was a good idea? It's for mobile devices, let us switch it to list view, you monkeys! Also, seriously, bring back the refresh button! If it ain't broke (ie general design) don't screw with it. I hate the new look."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had so many problems with this damn app. I've gotten hacked through this app a number of times because of it malfunctioning. I've Uninstalled this app on my computer because of all the issues, and now I'm considering deleting it off my phone. My Google play store says my Chrome app needs updating and I've tried in the play store, as well as, on the browser and this app will not update. When I hit update it does absolutely nothing. I'm starting get really fed up with Chrome."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A virus (or something), called masterhost.space, took over. I have an anti-virus app from the service provider, and had it scan the device. It found the problem and got rid of it. But soon, the non-stop pop-ups came back, but this time the security app did not recognize any problems. I would have uninstalled Chrome, if it was an option. It's not. So instead, I resorted to clicking Disable and Force Stop."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have had 3 phones in the past year so it is not the model of phone but seems with each update this app gets worse. If the sites that I have to use didn't only use to Chrome to run them then I would certainly not ever use this app and would remove it from any and all devices that I have and in future apps that I buy. Slow running, searching and sites being unsafe and the day before i use them, battery draining and so on. This browser's app should do a complete overhaul"
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update has made it a nightmare! It refuses to let me change my bookmark folders or make new ones, it's slow loading onto different sites, and crashes every now and then. It's upsetting right now because I'm trying to organize my bookmarks but whenever I hit ""Parent Folder"" my screen goes white and then takes me back to the page I'm currently trying to move into a different folder. I really hope this gets fixed or this is just disappointing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Who has so many tabs open they need to group them... Mirror PC functionality or at least don't make tabs grouped by default. Seriously, this breaks any speed in navigating open tabs by adding layered clicks to find a specific page versus just a simple swipe and select... It's obvious the devs don't get this feedback. I'm going to start looking for a browser that isn't hell bent on changing things for the sake of change."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Too much add on the new version. And adds contents are inconvenient and take up all the screens of a page. Also the new grouping system is not good at all...can't find anything anywhere. I like the old system of paging rathar than grouping....so I think there should be an option for the consumers to choose from whether they want grouping or paging like before.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every since a few weeks ago I have had constant crashes while using chrome, had to uninstall down to the factory version of chrome and now needless to say other website are having trouble displaying content. This is becoming annoying, and honestly theres a thousand other browsers I could download and not have to even think about troubleshooting anything. The difference: They don't have Google levels of money to pay engineers at their disposal yet their product is better? Embarrassing."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had a major issue that pages would not load, delete tabs.. cache, all data, history, everything. Even from the app settings. Nothing, restart also didn't work. Tried to update didn't allow me just refused but other apps allowed me to. Had to uninstall and reinstall (I've also had for months an issue with the whole app closing randomly on me) Which grew annoying."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The update is a nightmare. Since the update webpages are missing wording and symbols. Makes it totally impossible to navigate. It automatically updates on my phone. It came installed on my phone so there's no option to uninstall. If I uninstall all updates it runs fine in the older version. How can I get it to stop updating ? The update is not usable at all.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After using the app Tracker Control you see ""some"" of the trackers thatvare built into the app. Disabling them disables the browser. I'd rather use something else less stalky and its one less google product on my phone. Good riddens. Besides i think phone wise Firefox seems to be more reliable with videos playing. I think google tried to give this app every permission they have."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's like extortion. i use Chrome frequently. its works alright. google fudges its searches as usual. all the search results for its benefits. but most recent development is how the app starts malfunctioning if and when there is an update to be done. constant crashes. unreadable pages (English gets substituted to symbol font). slow response. etc.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, but I hate the newest update. I hate seeing all my tabs layed out in squares next to each other, and the new group tabbing is super confusing and unhelpful. It hides my tabs behind a single tab until I click on it to see everything. And if you click on a link, it automatically groups the tabs together. It's really hard to navigate and see everything at once. The small tab boxes make it crazy difficult to read the urls at the top of the tabs compared to the old version."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Haven't been able to update it, error 505 for over a year. On my android 7 phone, kernel version 3.18.35+, all apps have access to updates automatically. They all do with nil issues except for Chrome, error 505 as previously stated. Searched online for a fix, no luck. The response suggesting help on how to open Play to automatic updates, totally irrelevant. Tried uninstalling Chrome and re-installing, it won't uninstall. So my phone seems to be stuck with an app that is potentially full of security holes and increasingly out of kilter with other platforms I use with Chrome. Support, appalling."
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Crashes. Reads Google chrome has stopped. Will not load title page says title page not found then crashes multiple error messages. One star because it sucks now. 5 if it can be fixed. Still at a 1 because now I can not update. Update: new phone new chrome SAME ISSUE! Will not let me update it only reason I'm giving it 1 star is that there isn't a lower rating.
"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"if you want to put a permanent end to all the f'n popups from chrome, disable it and uninstall the updates. I did and now use another browser. now I don't get annoying popups every time I use my phone.

For a few days now whenever I try to use it, whether clicking a link, opening the app directly, or using the new tab shortcut, it tries to open and then immediately closes, sometimes giving me the ""keeps closing"" pop-up. I downloaded the beta app, but I hate it because it doesn't have tab groups (I'm one of the few who love them). Clearing the cache, restarts, etc. have not helped."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I agree with the top reviews. The new update of grouping tabs is annoying. I lose tabs all the time. I usually keep a tab open for using sites I regularly visit. But now I keep losing them and have to open a new one again and again, unnecessarily cluttering my experience. Also, I liked that I could just swipe to close a tab instead of trying to click on the X button and accidentally opening the tab when I want it closed. It's a mess."

Though they appear to give you the option to diable the grid layout flag, this option no longer does anything. I have had enough of developers taking away options and not giving me the courtesy of choosing how I want to use their program. Chrome is officially uninstalled. I urge everyone to forget Chrome and go back to good old Firefox."

"August 20, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When will you learn? This use to be a good fast loading brouser. You keep updating something every month thats not broke. Then the new update brakes it making it worse ( slower). You constantly Add more ads taking up at least 75% of a phone screen on every page opened. Most which are video. Which just slows down the brouser more loading it. I get to use about 25% of my high speed data every month and you steal 75% with your forced advertisement loads on every single page.

I would love to save my Chrome pages in my Google Drive then open them with just a click but I assume thats possible & the error is mine. Even with 100 tabs open, its lightning fast. The ability to backup all web activity 2Diff accts, is very convenient & allows organizing of bookmarks, open tabs, etc. Regardless of where u access Chrome, your account will update any changes you made, everywhere. It's done for us, nothing we need to remember to do. Videos on web pages can be set to: auto play/ask each time or don't play videos. You can even customize every category of ""clearing"" cookies, history, images, etc. Simply choose the number of days, weeks, month, all. I have enjoyed Chrome since it was initially released. It's always getting better. I'd love to save web pages w/o the need to create an actual bookmark. I appreciate the speed, regardless, of high # tabs open.

Not only that but having to create an entirely new tab group in order to open, say, an article in a new tab is pointless and confusing.

I tried repeatedly to contact support to no avail. They either don't answer or give me generic solutions that don't help or don't have anything to do with the issue. I'm ready to go back to Apple.

The windowpane view is much harder to scroll through and a lot easier to accidentally close tabs you want to keep open. The first time I used it I lost all the tabs I was keeping.

You disable the grid layout and tab groups, relaunch chrome, and nothing has changed, and the worst part is the settings say it has changed. App is almost unusable after this update"

If it gets fixed I'll bump this up to 3 stars due to the headache this browser causes with new implementations like this all the time."

It keeps crashing down every now and the, browsing is not as smooth and fast as it used to be.

I've tried multiple methods recommended on the internet but none of them seem to work. And when I say freezing, I don't mean just once a day or twice a day, every 5 to 8 minutes all day long. I'm afraid to uninstall it and reinstall it because I could lose all my sync when I make payments or purchases online. It's so bad it's affecting YouTube videos. It's not as bad but it's getting there. Somebody needs to fix this."

And if it opens trying to load in a webpage, it also doesn't work. On top of all that, even things that are powered by Chrome, like links within apps or the Google Lens, don't work anymore either.

"August 20, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Normally I love this app and would give it a 4 star but lately it's been asking me to update and will not allow me to update. I've tried many different methods with no success. and not matter how many times I press update in frustration nothing happens. So for now.. 2 stars due to that. Luckily however the older version is still working for now. Update 1/28/21- got an update to work a couple months ago but now it's doing the same thing.

Would be nice to have an easily accessible toggle to use our native OS's share menu instead. Some apps with accessibility permissions make Chrome's preview images for the tabs disappear and turns them into a list. Why should accessibility affect Chrome in that way?
