12-May-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate has been my trusty translator app that has helped me out in many a situation. It has been extraordinarily useful to me living in a foreign country, until now. I recently switched from iPhone to Android and I find the app to be unusable now. Bear with me while I try to explain. In the main part of the app up top, you have Google Translate written in the top bar, with the drop down me u box to the left. Underneath this, you have another bar with the Language from and Language to, with arrows between them that allow you to quickly switch the places of the two languages. Then under this, you have the area where you can enter the text you want to translate. However, as soon as you tap the text box, everything shifts upward, so that the first and second bar have now disappeared (this is especially annoying when you forget to press the arrows to switch the languages around before pasting in language to be translated from that is set as language to be translated to. There seems to be no way to access the arrows to switch the language positions - this was never a problem in iPhone). All you have is a single solitary bar to enter text at the extreme top of the screen. This makes no sense and on my new Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the app is basically using up 10% of my screen at the extreme top. And because of the location on my large screen, it is simply not comfortable to try reaching to the very top to tap and paste. Bottom line is I've now stopped using the app as it is so cumbersome for the reasons I mentioned above. I'm writing this review in the hopes that Google will consider some much needed changes to the Android version to make it more user-friendly, as I used it frequently on my iPhone and never had an issue.",Bugs,Features & UI,
12-May-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The translate quality is excellent. 3 stars for that. The UI experience is not so great. The one issue is how clunky the software feels to use. The animations when clicking on the text region feels completely unnecessary and less functional. Two menu items containing translate show up when selecting text other than base language. One of them in the extended menu and other first item. The latter of them works 50% of the time. Can't they be unified?,Bugs,Features & UI,

It's much harder to use because of how oversimplified the UI became. No option to revert back tp the previous layout either. There weren't any issues with the previous layout.

I have sent Feedback through this app twice and have seen minor updates since, but looks like nothing has changed so I decided to write a review here. Right now I'm using this app as I did years ago where you have to open the main app to translate a text you copied. That is how such a downgrade the latest UI/big update is. In the time this app was great you copy a text and that icon appeared, you tap and voila you right away you see the translation. Awesome! But now you either have to go to the main app (like it was years ago) or you allow that icon to always be visible on the screen. And even if that icon is visible, you now have to tap and then you still need to press another button (paste) to see the translation. What I would like to add to this, is the way Chinese is now translated. When translating Chinese you have Chinese characters, pinyin and of course the translation. The problem only now is, if the text is a little long, you cannot see all three at the same time. If you want to read pinyin, for example, then the box where Chinese characters are placed in will get smaller and then you won't be able to see all characters. Before this update, you were able to scroll through each individual box and that was very convenient, because then you can focus on specific parts of the sentence where you can see the characters, the pinyin and the translation at the same time.
