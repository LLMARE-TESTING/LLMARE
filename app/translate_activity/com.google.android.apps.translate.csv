"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recent update broke the camera feature. I am no longer able to translate from the live camera. Edit: totally useless reply from Google. I know how to use the camera translate feature. I've used it for years in more than two dozen countries. The recent update has broken the camera feature. It is frozen on whatever image is in front of the camera when you open the app. Even from photos it doesn't work. Useless.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Helpful at times, but constant issues. If you have an intermittent connection, it won't work even if you've downloaded the language to use offline. You save phrases once you find the right context, then it will completely change the context of the word when you revisit. Sometimes, it even just gives you the completely wrong translation. Incredibly inconsistent."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but I would like to suggest a feature that enables to quickly translate texts in real-time. For example, I can't understand Korean, but if I were to watch a Korean show where the subtitles hadn't been added yet, I'd like to use my phone with the camera aimed at the Korean subtitles section to capture the text and translate it at the speed of the subtitle transition in the video. Or something similar to this. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't have a huge necessity for a translation app, but it has been very, very helpful in my travels. The only thing that is slightly annoying is that the recording can stop prematurely in conversation mode. For example, if a person takes a sort pause, the app stops recording and the translation is referred incomplete. Otherwise this app is easy to use, and very comprehensive. Great work."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this app for years. Recently, it stopped working. I downloaded the needed language before a trip last week. It told me it was downloaded. When I tried using it offline, it told me I had to download the language. It was super frustrating because i didn't have service or access to wifi. I have tried fixing it several times, and no matter what I do, it will not translate offline. It has gone from auseful app to a pointless one. The Help sends you to a forum where everyone has the same issue."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Liking the new app. It's working great on my Pixel 7 Pro. The app runs faster, is less glitchy and doesn't time out. I like how the new split screen lets you sit across from each other and read the text. I use this to translate Thai, which is a notoriously difficult language. The app isn't perfect but does much better giving an accurate translation. It would be nice to be able to save larger transcripts than currently able to now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A once great app, laid low by terrible decision making by the developers/product team. You can no longer toggle between the original text and the translation when translating from an image. This is an awful decision since the translations are often not accurate and because sometimes a user may need the text in its original form in addition to the translation. I'll be using Deepl for now. It works better anyway. I do hope this gets resolved, though. I filed it via the help menu as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but in the last several months, the offline language packets are not functioning correctly and the app will not let me offline translate, unless I first click on a starred (saved) translation and then change to the needed language fields, then write in my desired translation (and sometimes that glitches as well). For work, I come across people who speak various languages and connecting even briefly with them means a lot, but also is a difference maker in an emergent situation."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. It is fairly accurate for the most part. Occasionally, I do verify the translation through another source.

It can help you quickly translate words and phrases, allowing you to understand what is being said in another language.helpful for all people around the world. Not only a few sentences or paragraphs, but this tool also allows to translation of different kinds of files such as DOCX, PDF, XLXS, etc. It's very simple and easy to use, I can type texts directly,"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Latest update to the UI is frustrating and clunky to use. Have been trying to adapt but there is simply too much on the screen at all times trying to translate a piece of text from an image. Previous UI design was intiuative and easy to understand. I've resulted in using the desktop version over the app because of how useless it is.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened. Was a nice simple translator. Now it wants to always take a photo instead of just translating the words I'm looking at. Its naff. I don't always have a connection to connect to the internet. Edit, it did get fixed. But today it's broke again. Using camera, instead of highlighting text and translating in real time, once again it wants to take a photo of the words to be translated. I've installed another translator (Yandex) that seems to work as intended."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm very disappointed that I no longer get synonyms, opposites and more than one translation suggestions when I translate a word, like I was previously able to, with both this app and the internet version of Google translate. Now, when I put in a foreign word, it gives me as translation only one word and no other options at all. Are you trying to make a subscription package to force us to pay for those things we previously had for free? This used to be an extremely useful tool."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was five stars, now zero. I work at a hotel with many Latino employees and this had been the best translator app out there. Then one day I open it up and it won't function at all. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, restarted my phone, nada. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and I hope they fix it because it was easily the best one with the best features, because I've tried them all. It's your update, Google, not our phones, not how we're using it. Totally nonfunctional. Fix it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"very good app, the camera translate features are very good but can be a little flakey at times, especially if the networks a bit slower (travel much?) app also forgets its a translator sometimes and gives the same result in english as was entered in a forgien language, because its commonly spoken in its original (foreign) form in english, which means to translate some phrases, you have to just google it, which is not helpful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It just wiped out all my history *The History does not store phrases added to the phrasebook or how can I find all my notes saved to the Phrasebook? I would also like to export selected notes to print them or save them in another file. *It is also great idea to translate directly while reading text in textfiles but it crashes and so it's just extra trouble maker.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I want to like this app, but with the handwriting feature not working properly, it's hard to. When you click the handwriting button, a ""Write Here"" box is supposed to display so you can transcribe characters or words, but it only comes up every now and then.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"During my one week stay in Mexico, I had to download this app twice. Each time it worked really well for about 2 days, and then it stopped working. When it wasn't working, instead of giving me a translation, it would just show a blank line instead of giving me the Spanish translation. Once I reinstalled it, it would then give me the Spanish translation under the English. I tested my data connection and my browser worked fine when the app stopped giving me a translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Again. Update broke it. Update at the end of Feb 2024 made it where it doesn't delete the translation after it sends so I have to go back and erase every message after it translates. **Looks like that was actually an issue with Gboard or Google Keyboard and how it interacts with translate. Installed previous version of Gboard and issue isn't there.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened? This used to be awesome. But now it won't let me switch from keyboard to voice, always loads the app on a random mode.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm very glad with this app, although I have one suggestion - Maybe it will be a good idea to have a switch between formal and casual translating.

(For example in German language)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As of the latest update, when using the camera for OCR translation, it would allow me to select one bit of text in the captured image and translate ONLY that line of text but now I can't do that. the ""send to Translate home"" button goes away if I tap the image.

I could tell you all the things to do to change it just try learning a language with it. But I'm not going to do the work for you. Now it freezes up since you have updated it. If I leave and come back it freezes and I have to close it. Also if I look up something with my Google voice it shows translation for split seconds and then disappears. I'm reading something. I want to see the translation and find it again
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am extremely disappointed in this app. It has been working fine for years.... and now all of a sudden it says there's no connection and it will not work.

PLEASE READ MY FULL REVIEW! ALREADY DID ALL THAT
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's pretty ridiculous that Google has all of the technology in the world at their fingertips but somehow only manages to make an installable app that doesn't allow you to translate from random pictures. Not pictures you take. But pictures that appear on social media or anywhere else.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for many many years and it's always been mostly good. My Chinese wife went back to China for several months and I didn't use it at all during that time and 3 days ago used it. It's a new interface and does a lousy job hearing me, it takes forever for it to speak what we said and only records half of what we said. I want the old versions of this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app. We took this to Japan and it was a great help. Love the system where you can point your camera at the notice or sign in front of you and get a translation on the screen!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ability to take a picture of translated text is gone, even though the UI tells me that's what the white button is for. I get options like ""share"", ""listen"" and ""select all"", but no option to just take a picture. This is inside the ""camera"" UI. I'm just taking screenshots at the moment which has all the UI on too. A really bad change."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't have any idea why they changed the application recently.. I hate all the new changes and how it functions. They need to bring the previous version back. And google is not getting the message .. People are saying clearly to simply bring the edition back that used to work great before.. but they just keep responding with meaningless messages!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm switching to Google Gemini for many translations because it's so much better. My languages for Translate are English, Vietnamese, Spanish, Indonesian, and Chinese. Translate fails miserably for Vietnamese (for reasons I understand, but nevertheless ...), and to serious extents for the other languages. Google Translate doesn't even understand plain, perfectly spoken English unless keyboard is set to English, and even then it transcribes with a host of errors."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's really poor in Arabic translation. It doesn't give correct translation, and it doesn't translate full sentences. Many words have no translation where you need to go on the web to find the correct one. Also, what is funny is that, it gives English translation to English, instead of giving its arabic translation 😅. Overall, it's better than nothing. The ""Reverso context"" app is way better"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update completely ruined it. Before, the real time conversation worked excellent.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bizzare how the text swap button works completely differently than on other apps, idk if thats bug or what but its really tiresome to write the translation again and again.

Still more pleasant than microsoft app, i give u that."

But it is what it is. At least I get marks on my schoolwork when I'm stuck on something. So you just gotta bear with it sometimes"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The program is crashing when I press ""conversation mode"" button (after allowing microphone permission). Upd. Ok, the problem can be fixed by manually allowing the storage permission, but why don't program itself asking for such permission? And why program is demands the storage permission for conversation mode? And why it crashes without?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. I especially love the detect language on a photo feature. I play an international game with no automatic translate on text and I use this app to communicate with others. It's not always 100%, but I can understand from context, like any other form of translation. Good job and keep it up."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"See, I use this to translate for elderly people that can't see, and I wanted the ability to flip my phone sideways to show them the translated word and it would show the translation at a full screen. They can't see 20 point font, the word has to literally be 72 point font! So bring back the full screen experience! NOW!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How can you make a product worse with an update? Seems like Google yet again comes up with an answer. If it's possible, please revert the function where one could save the characters from orginal language without having to translate it. For a lot of us this was a very useful feature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new format of this app is terrible, and not user-friendly. There was nothing wrong with the old layout and I would rather find an APK file with an older version or switch to a different app than this new version. Developers...STOP messing with apps that work just fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It constantly suggests (e.g. in WhatsApp) to translate to English ony phone from Filipino or Spanish. It would be great if I needed that, but the language is Croatian (not Filipino nor Spanish) so it is useless, unnecessary and annoying, don't know how to turn it off and I guess it doesn't work since it doesn't even recognize what language it is. Edit: still doesn't work even after the latest update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Uninstalled this app. Before the update, it is working fine and even offline. Now, it is not working offline and incorrect translation. What a bummer! UPDATE: Yes Google I did my feedback with screenshots. I tried to install it agai, same issue. So I ain't wasting time again"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works fine but it's not very useful for ideogram-based languages. I want to be able to click on the translated word and being able to get the reading, otherwise I still need to search it by radicals or meaning if I need to write it myself or say it out loud."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Only rated as a 3 because it's not the sort of app I get much use from. However the times I have needed to translate a foreign text, it seems to do a very good job. Well I assume it's done a good job as I haven't been attacked or arrested after using it to translate text"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I type a message on Google translate, the message to recipient does not change to chosen language, but stays on English in both parts. Eg English to Hindi, or English to Malay. They both text in English. Dear sir, the problem has now resolved itself. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app, but just to translate texts, which is kind of pointless honestly because there's that feature in Google already, the option to translate pictures, GONE. The only and ONLY reason giving it a 3 star is, It can translate long texts."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hey Google translate You don't know this but I can tell you that when you see this translate text on a black screen like this, naturally a human will not be able to understand anything accurately and it will be a big problem for your customers to understand things quickly and it will be a good experience if you get it right , I mean seeing blues like this on a black screen can be eye straining and it would be great to change that . Hope this gets fixed thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I usually use this to translate JP text when certain text are not translated when watching Anime on Netflix. Sometimes on a game where I play on a JP server if some text are new & haven't been translated yet (EN language patch by the game community) or some cases if I care what ppl are talking about in JP. Sometimes if the text's stroke shape is slighty different it fails to translate (sometimes when watching Anime)
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It kinda works, but isn't the best for slavic languages (cuz ggl translate rly doesn't translate directly rather always using English as an intermediary), probably even worse for non-indoeuropean languages. Also - sometimes it is extremely slow. PS: If you can, implement interslavic as an intermediary for balto-slavic languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had downloaded the first version of the app and used it whilst traveling through China on a transit visa final destination Vietnam. Although that was permitted at that time you would get into serious trouble now March 2024 for carrying this or any promotion of Google products in China. So its impressive, the reaction WOW among the younger generations of a defined broader modern translation. In other words how we talk day to day and not how we should talk. The update is even better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. Horrible. Hate it. It's slow, laggy and has a limit to how many words it can actually translate. Seriously is over rated. Sometimes I wilk be translating my homework (I am a foreign student) and the homework doesn't even make sense anymore!! I know, I should learn the language. I am. But I just don't have the time!!! Please, update the ai, try to make it a better up in general."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App used to be great, but now when using the translate app in let's say WhatsApp, after you type the message and send it, then click off the message, even though it was already sent gets put back in the text box. This is on a s23 ultra, all apps fully updated."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is the goat. It deserves 5 stars. BUT one thing is annoying me very much, how to remove a language from ""recent languages""? I have a list of most common languages that I translate from and to, but after the update, any language I use even once from like a week ago, it stays in the ""recent languages"" which makes finding my target language harder. Please fix this. Give us the option to remove a language from that list. You're the best, thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You have a glitch in the downloading of Traditional Chinese using Google Lens. When clicking on it, it downloads both Traditional and Simplified, yet when using the app off line, Traditional is no longer available for download even though it originally showed that it was downloaded under Google Translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stopped working a few weeks ago. A red box says it cannot connect to the internet. I have internet. I've Uninstalled/installed it. I tried the laughably inept 'send feedback'. Eventually, I moved on to a better app. Get it together, Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Image translate via Google lens is still not up to par with the standalone version used in previous versions of the app. There is no option to manually select items to translate nor an option to default to showing the original text first rather than the translation
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1. No options on where to download text-to-speech. 2. My phone is full of storage because I downloaded many languages, but some language don't work when offline. 3. Inaccurate translations sometimes. Please fix it. Thank you! ❤️"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would love a Watch version for voice translation. East Asian languages are challenging for any app... but this app is better than most. Regretfully, it was blocked by The Great Firewall of China (along with all other Google products) when I needed it most."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google translate is really good, i has ever been using it for years, the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because sometimes when i translate something to georgian the meaning is always off. please add the read out loud function to georgian, it's not very comfortable to read walls of translated text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great overall, but a feature I'm missing is the ability to pin a language at the top of the list. It's very tedious to scroll/search every time if you use more languages than there are ""recent"" slots. I really like the translate from photo feature, it makes it much easier to look things up quickly while e.g. grocery shopping. The translations themselves are good as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used Google translate for years. I love it. Until one day it stopped working. It says there's no Internet connection and can't run the off line language and can't generate voices. Nothing is working on my phone. Works great online. Just my phone app. When it works, I prefer it over Bing translator. I tried restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling, waiting, looking for answers, looking through settings. ????"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is pretty decent, but I can't get rid of that dumb and annoying ""translated text"" window that asks for feedback that never goes away. You slide it down to close, it opens right back up; such a dumb design. If I close that window it should stay closed. That window is gigantic and it takes up nearly half of my phone screen in landscape mode. This is so annoying and stupid and it's a terrible UI experience."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, I just discovered the floating button that can be added to the screen. However, I would prefer it to appear only when using apps I have selected from a list. Such as chat apps, and automatically hide when switching away from those apps. Most of the time it does not need to be on the screen if I am not translating. I also wish it was smaller and could be docked to edge of screen, like DeepL. Also, why can't we add hard returns to create paragraphs when typing text to be translated? Please? 😀"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Peace be upon you.. The latest update is very bad and its translation is inaccurate. I hope you add more terminology and make it much better offline.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use this to speak to Spanish only speaking people from english. Constantly having to Google what is being said because the translation doesn't seem to make sense. Why is what Google translates in the browser different than the translation app? ETA: I don't actually know Spanish how am I supposed to report something wrong? Why is is the translation different in different parts of the app? Doesn't it use the same dictionary? It would also be nice if the pop-up provided more than one translation
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What is the point of downloading language files when the app refuses to work without an Internet connection? That is very naughty of you Google. Does that comply? The fix was to update the language files. It would be nice if Google informed its victims that offline translations won't work until language files are up to date.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is still an issue with the original text display disappearing. Even after the latest update, I talked about it in detail in Google Help and did not receive any response. Brother, when will you correct this error? I really need to fix it."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app worked well. But recently it has been auto updating with new features that actually make it have worse functionality. I use the conversation functions often. sometimes a device misshears what you say, So I edit the words before showing a translation. The new features prevent such editing. If I press the English text I can not edit, but now it reads aloud the text. In the last two days I've had to uninstall 4x If there was a way to refuse new features or switch them off then no problem"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have always loved this app. It has always worked flawlessly however after recent updates it's virtually unusable! Using voice to speak into the phone and have it translated is extremely slow and almost 100% of the time can't even use it because it won't even finish! I'm using English to Vietnamese and vice versa. Please fix this! I will need to be downloading a different program. If this can't be fixed I will have no choice but to uninstall Google Translate.. ........

I translate into multiple languages and when in dark mode the language select buttons display in black text. Black text on a dark gray background.

This is very frustrating especially since I have a pixel phone... I have tried the suggestion of restarting my phone as well... I need this to work please"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update sucks. Especially for Japanese translation. I used to be able to use it offline, though in very low accuracy, now I can even use it.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did you guys remove the ability for me to go into select albums to translate images? This just made the app overall worst for me. Edit: It seems like you guys misunderstood, I was referring to the fact that I was able to filter/select what albums from my phone that I wanted to translate. Instead, all that shows up is an image selector for picking some of the most recent images (with screenshots being separated)"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bug fixes and improvements. I guess if you analyze the app everyday on the level the devs do, you see it differently. The rest of us just see it for face value. The ease of use. I think it's terribly inconvenient to what it was a few years ago. Unfortunately, all the other apps I've tried are even worse. Keep up the bad work. You're still not as bad as your competitors. I miss the days when you could copy some text in another language, and the translate bubble would pop up. It was so easy."

Nothing helped. Once it came back and did one translation, then stopped working the same way again. It's infuriating. Please fix. My previous review was 5 stars."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, this app had done exactly what it was adele to do. It has given me dramatically correct translations from English to Spanish and German to English.ive compared it to books that have the proper grammar, and the results have been excellent.

You are not allowed to give it permission to view all your photos. Also selecting a photo from your photo gallery cannot just count as giving it permission.

Whenever I write in English and translate it to other language. I copy the translated words/sentences and translate it to English. I just realized that it was different. Just like when I'm writing for a singular person, it turns it to plural which is really confusing. I can't use it on offline purposes anymore. This is sucks."

I mean only about 30% (that's being generous) of the languages listed can Google translate app actually translate them... This is seriously embarrassing! I mean the entire world already believes that we're a bunch of dumba$$ arrogant bullies!!! This app is just making them seem right! Smdh"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The translation takes forever. And the funny thing is, it's faster to use Google search to translate rather than wait this app to translate a single word. Always had a problem with connection on this app, even though there aren't any problem when I did the same thing on website."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Telugu to english translation is substandard and sometimes the end result either has a different meaning or is meaningless. You too would agree if you see the screenshots...

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent translation app. Not only can it translate like the normal G: Translate website ... it also allows you to hold your phone up to an image with text, and it superimposes the translation over the original text. This smooth function is super fantastic! It works like something out of a spy film or a sci-fi movie."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Superb! One of the most practical and easy to use application for translating. I love how easily it translates via the microphone. I simply converse in English and it gets converted to Sindhi which I copy and paste to my relatives who are more comfortable talking in the Regional language. After the addition of 2 options; conversation mode and the camera mode for translating pictures with text or sign boards, this app has become simply amazing."

But i don't always believe the translation in it.... from English to Arabic..... when I write a sentence or a word, you are not giving me the right meaning and not giving me the all meanings of the word. I just use this app in some words and phrases."

Missing Morse Code Translator with possibility to read flashes with camera or sound with microphone and sending flashes with torch or sound with speaker. After that would be for nobel prize!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are no adds, which is how all translation apps should be but this is the only one I could find without any. It's easy to use and pretty trustworthy. However it does get very specific with the words you use and depending on the language you might say somthing inappropriate without being warned."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect for having conversations and making friends with people who I once would have never even met online. But the only 2 problems are 1)the lack of a chat app function and 2)because of this, any conversation in an app with end to end encryption requires the support of an app such as Google Lens along with screenshots of the conversation."

BEWARE: Google controls Do Not Allow you to delete old conversations & word searches. Despite turning data collection off in the app's menu & deleting past searches/conversations, Google still retains personal info in a HISTORY file. 3. Google Help is locked in response to ""Q: how do I turn on volume for Google Translate app on my ... Phone. The response page is useles. I'm still searching YT."

It was a brilliant experience I had in Spain. It is such a good idea to create this kind of apps. I was really impressed by the way I was smoothly communicating with them"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,the biggest downside of the app is when you try to translate from a screenshot there's to much other stuff on the screen that you can't get rid of making translation a bit difficult..
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi, I like the new UI, fits well with android 13 style, one minor complaint, in the old versions there was a language selector when a translation is shown, I could just select a different language without starting a new translation. This is an inconvinience if I need to translate to multiple languages I now need more clicks. On the pc version the language selector is shown at top, all the time,just like older mobile versions. Add this back if possible, thanks. Other than that, great app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is One serious flaw, in what I think is amazing tech. Let's say you do voice translate, and your say, three times three equals nine. It puts in 3*3=9 and ""translates"" that into your selected language as 3*3=9 !!! Bizarre! Any time I use voice to translate, it uses numerals instead of the word. I say three, it types as 3 and translates as 3. Also, a recent update waits and waits before translating, so you hit stop but it starts a new translation! I downgraded to 1. Each update is a downgrad"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old version was easier to use and almost perfect. Why do you have to make everything complicated? Not helping. No imorovement at all. I redowloaded it again but when using the translation, only keeps on saying ""translate offline next time""??? Downloaded the language but nothing happened. Before you can just easily focus your camera on words and will translate good. Now its useless even you are using wifi."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For the Dev: There is a bug in the Lens part of the app, where if I load a photo with Japanese text, and manually select the language as Japanese (not leave it on auto detect), if I try to use the ""listen"" function on individual words in the picture that contain only Kanji, the app will pronounce them in Chinese rather than Japanese. If I select more text around than included some hiragana or katakana, app will then correctly read everything including that word in Japanese. Good app otherwise."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I prefer the old version, this new upgrade is a disaster. I used to be able to translate o issues I can't even translate on Facebook now, or if I need to translate questions. Why on the translator is the camera not responding please. Thank you, I have uninstalled and added app again does not work on my moto phone. I have deleted it and restalled also, cleared all data etc nothing. It just keeps saying no Internet connection, but on my other phone it works both phones the same."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worked great before the update, always got a translation. Now it wants me to download every single language I try to translate. I use this for my job and need to translate many languages on the fly sometimes. Good work."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Translate English to Spanish. Phone all uodated, good wifi, good data. Google translate stops working many times mid sentance. You stop talking. Sometimes, takes 40 seconds to read out loud. Main probkem with this app, it stops taking your voice so you think it is dictating what you have said and then waiting to translate when you have stopped talking. Does not dictate. Stop working somewhere in your sentence. Terrible app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is incredible WHEN IT WORKS! Unfortunately I'm trying to transcribe audio from a YouTube video in Spanish and it just stops listening at random intervals. Had to give up
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app gives me odd offspec and weird/random capitalizations where no capitalizations are necessary. No pinyin entry for Chinese. Disappointing. Also: people get a lot of rubbish translations and many translations are simply wrong. There is no reason why this App needs or should have access to contacts. Random punctuation created by the app also don't help. Useless app. A LOT has to be corrected.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google translate is a very helpful app for a person like me that helps me keep connect with so many things and keeps me updated.

I need to check for sure its there in the history log . And the history goes away on the app . Also the internet kept history is hard to translate again if you need to , but i guess since its for free its all normal not be perfect"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So powerful but such limited usability. It needs to read slower, have an option to pause and better sorting when scanning a page with different word formats on it (eg. floating word options listed on top of fill-in-the-blank sentences). Currently it seems to display on a top to bottom, left to right manner."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, but for some reason in the camera translation when I select a word from the original language, it always goes to the internet browser, it's so annoying...! And more annoying that always said ""Your search is configured to return zero results"" it should allow only select, not search for anything on internet until I press that option"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In conversation mode, it stops translating before a sentence is finished and often doesn't hear what's being said. Gets a lot wrong in comparison to earlier versions. Also seems to take a lot longer to translate. And the new split screen for conversations is too small."

I have opened all permissions and allowed background running. This didn't used to happen in 2023. 🙏"

Unbeknown to us It even translated the conversation of the others around us: waiter, table behind and beside us! Lol! Love it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The change in adding words to your list has completely caught me off guard. I have to open a menu first instead of just clicking on the star as it was previously.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Vey handy if you are planning to travel to a foreign country and need to know some words in the specific language. I like that the app puts the accents on the words automatically when you type the words in other languages. Nothing bad to say about this app.

My mother inlaw is from Hong Kong and only speaks Cantonese, and unfortunately, google Translate doesn't support that language. So i have to use another translator app. Since family is the MOST important thing to me, I have to give it a low rating, or else I would have scored it perfec 5 stars."

Update: I have tried everything (clear cache, storage, reinstall, re-start) nothing is working. And also, no one is assisting in the community forum too. It's like the app is only blocking storage on my device."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm not impressed by the translations and the AI constantly changes gender. What's with the double space in the translated text and why can't I turn it off?! The thing that I like about the app is the ability to translate offline but even that is tainted by the inability to delete your history of translations before you go online making me concerned about my privacy being exploited and abused by design.

Whatever sum I'm using, for example 5 million (might be referring to birds or stones, whatever) Google will add $ as if it has to be money as soon as a sum is mentioned. And because it's money it has to be American dollars. Another major disaster is the reply Google will give on any feedback. “Please tell us what your problem is”...silly me, I thought I just did."

Why do I suddenly have to click the arrow to get to my translation? Also the feedback on the translated text function is aggrevating??

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app in general is good for translating but I would like to see and other variations of one language for example Portuguese(Brazil)
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please just fix this app. It's essential for me to get accurate information VERBALLY from people who don't speak English. None of the voice features work after the last update. I tried everything in the comments below. I own a Pixel go figure.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app because it works really well but, it's better if the Arabic words had the pronunciation vowel attached to them that would do better"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"REQUIRES INTERNET. Works decently when it can. But don't ever rely on the downloaded languages, downloading languages for ""offline"" is pointless since it still requires the internet to run the app. You still 100% need internet to even use the app. Ultimately useless as a discrete app, especially since it still forces the use of other apps and features (particularly the invasive google lens) despite barely doing anything itself."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google translate! I use it all the time. However, I want other languages like Hebrew, for instance, audibly available for pronunciations help."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just terrible English to Spanish.. I am bilingual. Don't trust Spanish translations Terrible translations from English to Spanish.. Fortunately I can correct most errors It's great for online translation which can be converted into pdfs. However, it doesn't retain Capital letters when translating. Again I am bilingual and the English to Spanish word rendering sometimes is way off. Will look for a better app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a person who doesn't know English very well & everything is in English nowadays, Google translate is a blessing but I personally feel it, Google translate is not useful anymore. Bugs not limited to app. If you go to any website & translate via option (using Opera & chrome), it doesn't translate whole page but partially until you don't start scrolling, it then translates as you scroll. Major bug facing since last year. No dark theme on web or app. Icon not matching Google multicolour pattern."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stop rendering apk useless if we don't update. That's extortion. That didn't happen before. Also I don't have lens installed so app is useless for photo translation.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Aaa i dont like the new version of Google translate. Back then, when I copied text, google translate will automatically appear with the translation but now it doesn't, we need to detect the language first (i know i can set the language but still it's not convenient) and the icon doesn't automatically appear as well when I already activated the auto-translate copied text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So disappointed! Cannot download Italian. I've cleared the cache,uninstalled and reinstalled the app. So useless! Forums where this question has been asked online have been locked which says it all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always consistent but let the phone version be like pc version where you can check the translation if the first is correct or the second translate... But still the Best 💯👌🏾
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is broken as of the last update and seems that Google is just sticking their head on the sand instead of fixing it. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The update sucks. If something isnt broken leave it alone. In my opinion you took a perfectly good app and ruined it. Any chance of getting an older version that worked fine and was simple to use and didnt need tweaking?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is GREAT, and it support my language ""Hmong,"" but there are two problems with the Hmong translations: 1) the Hmong translations isn't always accurate (not enough Hmong vocab data in Google's engine, which I understand), 2) Google Translate doesn't support Hmong TTS, which makes things harder for both non-Hmong and Hmong to learn, understand and even use this app. I REALLY hope that Google can provide Hmong TTS in the near future. PRETTY PLEASE GOOGLE."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works but lacks quality of life functions like saving the translated image on the phone. No, I have to 'share' the image to get a copy. Truly obnoxious"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to be very good and would be 5 stars The fact that Cantonese is no longer available is a DISGRACE. Yes CCP controls HK. There are hundreds of thousands of people all around the world who speak Cantonese but can not read Chinese Characters. This is totally unacceptable. China and the CCP do not own the language of Cantonese. They can say that everyone in China must speak Mandarin. Google Translate should have another Chinese option available for the MILLIONS of Cantonese speakers !!!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest version doesn't translate anything! Input Spanish and it output Spanish saying that it was the English translation! In other words it did nothing and translated nothing. I put Spanish language in and it put Spanish language in the English output!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is nonsense it has no shortcut to be overlay on the screen so an to drag and translate easily you must copy the text and go to the app before translation 😭😩😮
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app because it translates everything but the words what you are looking for will change into a different word Like,nazal in Arabic translates into download which is not the correct I was trying to find the opposite word and it became ""ride"""
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Horrible at translating. Changes my words sometimes to insulting phrases or completely changes what I'm saying to the opposite or even insulting text. When it does work it's goods. But doesn't work as often as it should.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good translator, sometimes a little formal, but generally I'm understood. I'm told that the formal translation can be a little harsh to native speakers, meaning less colloquial"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app. I just wish they would add more choices to theme options. I keep trying other apps because you get to custom the message theme to what you like.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still translation problems ESPECIALLY SWEAR WORDS. IT IS DANGEROUS NOT TO TRANSLATE IF SOMEONE IS SWEARING. I had an aggressive person I thought he was just frustrated as he didn't speak English but I soon realised he was being aggressive and threatening me. IF TRANSLATE WORKED PROPERLY I COULD HAVE LEFT EARLIER. Instead of trying to help him. DONT BUY S24 IF YOU WANT IT TO TRANSLATE CONVERSATION.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't work for audio, will pick up a word or two but if there is even a slight pause it just stops translating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ads have increased. There are too many. And I can't get the app out of my notifications at the top of my phone. It won't close without uninstalling it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty great overall. Fantast for commonly spoken languages (for me in San Francisco it's dialects of Spanish and Chinese), but it would be great to have more options for more niche dialects. ie Persia uses Darci vs Farci."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app needs an overlay function so you can translate things on your screen inside your UI such as overlays that appear outside of browsing window.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app's update just ruined everything I can't translate and it keeps saying that I should check my connection and network, whereas my network is perfectly fine, I hate this, please look into it as soon as possible I really need it"

Even then, I'm being directed to one Gmail address that I don't use, and I can't log in to the Gmail account that I want to sign in to. There is no option to change it either, and I'm at my wits end trying to access this app."

Now I must be connected to the internet before I can translate anything in those languages. But it still shows that I have already downloaded the language packs. So why is it online use now??? Please fix.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and has a user friendly interface however there's just one thing missing, I need to be able to use the voice translator while I'm making use of other apps. Adding this feature would take this app to the next level."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UI has become more unfriendly to use . With this latest update , it is very difficult to find keyboard to type the word that I want to translate . Looking for alternatives. The same app on iPhone is Lot better when compared to Android."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be better. After the latest update, I'm thinking about deleting this app because I can't use this as I want anymore. Before that, I could translate a word and see the alternative versions of it, and usually can find the word I want. But now, It doesn't give you any alternatives under, just word and some compound words with that. I want to see alternatives of a word, I used to do that only using this app but now I need to search up the internet every single time..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most translations are accurate. I didn't give the fifth star so that you changed the place of the pronouncation button, and put it under the word. It is not practical. Please put the pronouncation button to the previous place, to the end of the line at the same line with the word."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Bad interface. Used to be better. Google is constantly getting worse and worse across the board.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Without WiFi, it will definitely take more than 5 minutes to translate a simple word, and sometimes even with WiFi, it might take 5 minutes. Also the offline version is pretty much useless as it will take even more time to do it as well. After the update, it becomes incredibly terrible"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"We used this app loads on a trip to Germany. It gave me confidence to go out on my own & was a major help to me wherever I went, shopping, dining, site seeing, etc. It was especially helpful to me when I lost my way getting back from the closest laundry in a nearby city & my hotel."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's wonderful that you have different languages for people to learn but what about the ones YOU don't have translations for? I wanted to learn Hawaiian but you have no translation for it. Very disappointing. You guys have to fix this. People use your app want to learn about the different languages. What about the Spanish languages like Potuguese, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Venezuelan, Peruvian, Guatemalan just to name a few. The Spanish culture has different dialects. You must fix this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be great but since the last few months it no longer works offline even with the offline databases installed. Not great when you travel a lot and don't have a consistent cellphone or wifi connection.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is the ultimate best! Not to mention it's free for the world to use & access!

Yet there's still some genius wanna be complaining about not being able to distinguish some casual & formal tense IN LATIN DIALECTS so he could only spare 4 stars! Man thats what you call a PUTRIDUM PODEX! Ppol nowadays so ungrateful
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only thing I wish this app has for available language downloads to translate in real-time; is for the availability of Jamaican Patois.

The voice gender cannot be changed in the Google Translate app. Gender equality should be respected in that department too. Have various voices to choose.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall I feel Google translate is very good. I wish they had a faster way to switch languages but perhaps they will continue to work on it. When your trying to communicate with someone of a different origin and they too are using Google translate it can get confusing at times. Perhaps the confusion is partly my fault but at the present time I feel 4 starts is appropriate and I would certainly recommend Google translate to everyone!😊

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The update did not help. It made it less user-friendly and more user error friendly. The fact that it doesn't automatically translate languages still is a sore spot for me. And the fact that it is so slow to load is also not good

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate has been my trusty translator app that has helped me out in many a situation. It has been extraordinarily useful to me living in a foreign country, until now. I recently switched from iPhone to Android and I find the app to be unusable now. Bear with me while I try to explain. In the main part of the app up top, you have Google Translate written in the top bar, with the drop down me u box to the left. Underneath this, you have another bar with the Language from and Language to, with arrows between them that allow you to quickly switch the places of the two languages. Then under this, you have the area where you can enter the text you want to translate. However, as soon as you tap the text box, everything shifts upward, so that the first and second bar have now disappeared (this is especially annoying when you forget to press the arrows to switch the languages around before pasting in language to be translated from that is set as language to be translated to. There seems to be no way to access the arrows to switch the language positions - this was never a problem in iPhone). All you have is a single solitary bar to enter text at the extreme top of the screen. This makes no sense and on my new Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the app is basically using up 10% of my screen at the extreme top. And because of the location on my large screen, it is simply not comfortable to try reaching to the very top to tap and paste. Bottom line is I've now stopped using the app as it is so cumbersome for the reasons I mentioned above. I'm writing this review in the hopes that Google will consider some much needed changes to the Android version to make it more user-friendly, as I used it frequently on my iPhone and never had an issue."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wish there was an icon or widget I can add to my home screen... Other than that, great app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally pretty good. My two biggest issues are 1) that ""recent languages"" really means ""every language you've ever looked at"" because there is no way to edit the list (you can clear it by clearing the data and starting over); and 2) that it will translate incorrect language without pointing out that the input is wrong - can be a little unhelpful when trying to use the app as a learning tool."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The revised interface is horrendously bad, almost totally unusable. Dogshit is a word that comes to mind. It's baffling to me that anyone could ever have approved such a wretched downgrade in an application. The massive text size, massive area for entering text, and the confusing interface make for a worse experience than every prior version of the app. So much real estate is wasted on what looks like an accessibility setting when what users actually need are visible alternate translations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Translate from any language into English and vice versa. You can tap the camera mode and point it at the language for a translation but here the app fails for the lines of text get jumbled. The (your) microphone, which enables you to speak and have a translation, frequently misheard my words. This app is great when it comes to typing text and getting a translation. Best to go on holiday to isolated places, so you don't have people fuming in the queue behind you (joke)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad application for basic use. A bit slow in translating, on rare ocassions, and translations not perfect. Due to language, grammar, syntax, etc. it can't be... no program can be. No problems. Only minor issue is conversation mode doesn't always stay active after a verbal translation, so it's difficult to, for example, give directions in a timely manner. Have to keep reactivating it. All-in-all, a good app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Until recently, late 2021, this App used to be our go to. Now, any text takes forever to translate, if it does at all. Whoever tinkered with it should be demoted. While cleaning the floors, that person could reflect on the need not to fix things that aren't broke. No camera translation either. Kindly get it back to the state it was mid-2021. Then the review should be more favorable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sadly after many years of usage I've finally had to give up and uninstall it. Not even talking here about UI getting worse and worse with each version. At this point it can't reliably perform its main task - simply translate things. No matter whether you have offline dictionaries or not, internet connection on or off - it just keeps showing message: ""Can't translate. Check your connection and try again"". Fortunately there are still solid alternatives out there."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the update I've been struggling to get used to the formatting, i thought i would after a few uses but no. While translating the font is huge for no reason and you can't even change it. The UI is confusing, font too big, some areas the font goes back to normal, no difference between non buttons and buttons, etc. Over all bad. it does have good additions but they get really overshadowed by the design."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible since one of the latest updates. Interface was extremely simplified making navigation between menus extremely clumbersome. The photo translation was replaced with a Google lens alternative that just doesnt work, and when it does, it always mistranslates something. Downloading a language for offline use does nothing other than take up disk space, as you will still need to be connected to the internet. Was one of the better translator apps. Not anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is a huge dissapointment. Very annoying and frustrating experience. It was so easy to use and seamless before. Now, all good features have gone. The beauty of this app was when you tapped long or copied a text, the floating button used to appear automatically and when you tapped the button the app used to open with the translation. Now, you have to open the app first (either from the floating button or from the launcher icon) then you have to paste the text. Why did you do this? >:("
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since a few updates ago there is no longer an option to use your finger to highlight the original text in pictures. Often the app incorrectly groups together Japanese characters, especially if there's two columns of text, & I can't get the app to highlight the correct group of characters & in the right order. Also, sometimes it doesn't recognize characters at all, and it would be nice to be able to write in/input the missing characters into the text being translated at the bottom of the screen."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update, it became very inconvenient to use the ""Tap to click"" function. Whether the icon about hangs constantly on the screen, or you have to turn it off, because it interferes. Previously, it appeared when adding text to the clipboard and translated in one click. Now, to translate, you need to make 10 clicks. I'm so sad. Do as it was."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recent update on Galaxy S10 no longer allows the Translate bubble to pop up only when something is copied. Now it's always there, unless you turn it off, but I only want it there when I copy something. So now equires a lot more work for me now. I've used this app daily for almost a year. Good app, but needs a better translation sometimes, and needs a bit better of a user experience. Let me know if you want to get on a hangout to chat about it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hey Google, what the heck did you do?! Nice material design update AND dark mode, thank you, BUT totally broken functionality! Floating icon doesn't work - the app loads, but the text in the clipboard isn't automatically loaded into the translation. While in the past it took me just two clicks to get to the desired translation, now it's 8-10 before I get to the same result as with the previous version. Can you do a quick rollback, please?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"when you copy a text, it used to open a icon that can Translate the text on a tap. Now you have to enable in the settings every time and it keep showing in the notifications bar it's kinda annoying...once you click stop you can't get any translation.. unleds you turn back on in the app... I'm using it to communicate with my mom in mandarin and I don't choose when I receive a text from her... It was better in the previous update, once you copy it there's an option to translate on a tap without having to go in the app to enable it each time"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new version lacks the useful dropdown language menu and the easy, one tap switch from one language direction to the other. Now language modules need to be downloaded, a slow and unnecessary process, compared to the old version. In Chinese, the pinyin is no longer presented simultaneously with the hanzi (character) and the copy tool is missing. The writing tool is unnecessary, typing is faster and more accurate. Developers couldn't have made worse choices for these so called improvements."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app does not have a night(dark) theme to ease our eyes and battery, and I think it is not because the devs do not know how to make a dark theme in 2018. The Phrasebook(where we save our favourite) cannot be saved as text, to storage,unless you do it by hand copy paste each part; there is possible to select the translations one by one but does not have option to do anything with the selection. The german,english to romanian translation are quite bad sometimes or even missing all together, at least for the offline situation. I would have rated it 2,5, because those very helpful settings could be done with ease if the bosses give the order. And it also lacks the ""suggest a better translation"" option which is present on the browser version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reply to dev: a google app must have some priviledge on this. I always leave it on because I am constantly messaging people that don't speak my language, and that feature helped me a lot. Some apps does not have the copy menu because they only allow to copy the entire message, and that pop up is not shown. The other method, minimize is still appearing there in the status bar. I tried to go over the app notification settings and managed to disable notifications for the tap feature. However, now I'm getting a battery usage notification. What a mess! :-( (on persistent notification saying that the tap translate is on)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrendous after update. I used to be able to copy a word, hit the floating icon and it would automatically translate the word. When I copied a new sentence it would automatically replace the previous and again automatically translate. Now I have to manually paste in each sentence /word I copy. In addition to that, the previous copy remains so I have to erase that and paste in the new text. Unless im missing something? It boggles my mind the geniuses at Google thought this was a good idea. UPDATE - i just went ahead and installed a rolled back version of the app i found elsewhere. That one works as it should before it was destroyed. So, thank you for creating that one. Also, please stop telling people to submit feedback. If you actually listened or cared, you devs would roll back the app and/or fix it based on all the terrible feedback."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi, it's so bad, the main app and ""Tap to Translate"" get so more screen space. The font is too big, it should be smaller. ""Tap to Translate"" does not directly translate what has been selected and copied, it needs to click to translate it. ""floating icon"" doesn't hide after 2 seconds, it remains visible permanently, that's really annoying. Thanks!!!"

It didn't use to be that way, it's a big mistake making it working this way. Please revert it to the way it worked before. Dropping the floating icon into the crossed circle doesn't mean I am not gonna use it anymore... I will but maybe later. It's a bit of a hassle to go to settings to turn it back on. TY!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update removed the ability to both handwrite and speak with the same text. If you want to speak some words then correct the mistakes using handwriting that is no longer possible. Massive downgrade in its usefulness studying Chinese. EDIT: To clarify, I can handwrite and I can use voice. However, you can't have text already in the textbox and then also speak. The transcribe button is disabled for Chinese (even though you can use the mic once per translation)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The main problem I have is with writing long multi paragraph messages. The input window becomes too small and I find myself constantly scrolling up and down to look for typos (i use the swipe keyboard). It would be really useful to add a grab area between the input and the output to resize them to be larger or smaller. Or alternatively add an option checkbox to keep both input and output stacked and visible (when ticked) or stacked and not visible (when unticked).
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Catastrophic update. It completely handicaps the ease of use of the most useful function ""Tap to Translate"". Originally a Copy would prompt the floating window to pop up. Now ""Tap to Translate"" requires twice as many taps, and again double if u want to flip the languages (why would you remove the language flip arrow!). When an appearance update brings with it a worsened core functionality, there is a problem. These functions made the app amazing. Dumbing the app down means it no longer is."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi dear authorities Unfortunately, the problem in the current version is that there is no access to the previous words and translations, and we must go to the settings and see the previous words, if they were always available before I updated it. I was able to see the previous words and be able to compare, and every time I used Google Translate, seeing the previous words of Barley was repeated and practiced, and it helped me a lot in learning and remembering them,which every day sometimes even"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please, please, let the users turn back on the previous version of image translation! It was nearly perfect! While Google Lens is absolute pain: it's inflexible translation-wise, and the interface elements block a very large part of the image (well, obviously the image is way more important than the huge buttons that cover it and can't be hidden!). Just why someone decided this drastic change was a good idea?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great app. Simple and intuitive, and amazingly helpful. The last update removed almost all the 5 star aspects. The app is almost forgettable. It is now clunky and hard to use one handed, filling an excessive amount of screen real estate. The quick access button now hovers all the time, not just when needed. And use now requires additional unnecessary clicks (to paste text previously copied). And the history of previous translations is gone. Hopefully there is another app that worked as well as this did before, so I can switch!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They really messed up this app with the latest update!! The fonts are now giant, kindergarten-style, and you can no longer see a translation without going through the hassle of minimizing your keyboard! Then, because of the kindergarten font, it's difficult to place your cursor at the point where you want to make an edit to transcribed text. VERY POORLY CONCEIVED revamp of an interface which was previously perfectly fine. Google, you should revert! This update is a major downgrade."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great! I can download and translate when no internet, and speak to others in a foreign language! 😊"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i was using the old version of this app, and its interface was practical and fast. few days ago, I've updated it, and they have changed so badly that I'm looking for a way to Ingram old version. wow to the designs! i don't care how much you have improved the ai or coding it what ever data monitoring behind it, as long as it is not practical and you have switch between translations and hit back, it has lost the meaning to use it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ruined the usability of Translate! Translate has continuously improved over the years and I love it and use it every day. BUT someone changed the functionality of the floating bubble. Now one must choose whether it is viable all the time (getting in the way frequently) or none of the time (you must open the full app and past your text to be translated - how inconvenient!). In the past it popped up when you copied something to the clipboard - it appeared when needed. -10 stars for the change!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally quite useful, but the Vietnamese version is very annoying. Some algorithm seems to change the words you type if you write something less common. Accents and whole words, suddenly change, which force you to delete it and type again. Didn't see this with other languages, although I used quite a few of them. One thing I find super annoying is automatically inserted spaces, often at the wrong place. I know when to insert them, thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is clunky and hard to use. I tried to deal but it's impossible to see your translation and original text side by side or to only translate portion or single word of something. The translation floats over what you're looking at, completely blocking it. Lens is a mediocre solution. Scan function could have used improvements, but this is the wrong direction. It's also a pain to find the handwriting tool, now. It used to be front and center where it was needed. Sad."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for about 6 years. Works great mostly. But I have to keep downloading and older APK because the newer interface, material u, doesn't work the same. When communicating with family overseas, it's easy to copy the message I want to translate, hit the floating bubble, read what they said, hit new translation and the app automatically switches between the languages and I can start typing my response quickly. The material u interface is a lot more work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The single displayed translated word is often not the right one. I need to be able to see all the alternative translations as you can on the website. Response: No, it's not a matter of translation being incorrect and needing correction, but since words have several different, all technically correct translations,it's important to be able to see *all* of them."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The translations are good and mostly understandable. But when I scroll through selected text on an image, it often closes the image (when I accidentally tap or scroll too far) to open up the selected text in a new window, and there's no way to return to the image so I have to rescan or reopen the image every time. As I'm only using the app for image translations, this is an unbelievably annoying problem so I can't rate it more than a 2."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very annoying when ""you"",""yours"" etc is translated into ""vous"",""votre"" etc in French, instead of the intended ""tu"",""ton"",""ta"" etc. This is my biggest problem with this app. Sometimes I feel like breaking my phone because of this. The app doesn't accomadate very well languages which have a polite form of speech distinct from regular speech, such as it is in French. There should be a button on the app to accomodate this feature in some languages, a button which can be switched on or off. Simple!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the old version better. I frequently use the starred/saved list to review. Now, Everytime I open a saved translation, then go ""back"" to the list, it starts at the top again. Have to re-scroll down. Also, suddenly, all 4k of my translations are in my app. I don't want them all synced from Google acct to my translate app. It has become less functional. I'll look for another app. One upgrade I like, I don't need to open each translation to read it, even if it's several sentences"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The look of app has changed. The font size is now ginormous (for no good reason) and has no way of adjusting it down. I use to like this app and use it another. All of sudden it changed, now I have to constantly scroll up and down to see the translation. I hate it and so annoying. If this is not change back or the font size is not resizable down, I will look for another app to do the job. Such a useless upgrade!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to translate directly from my reading app, by seecting ""Translate"" from context menu of the selected word or phrase. But after latest update, the pop-over has reset language settings, and you can't change them in it directlty. Going to app, and changing them there does nothing, as they're not synced anymore. That was main use case for the app, would highly appreciate if you would bring that back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 9/2022.. the user interface really stinks compared to how it was a year or two ago. Also, the most negative thing about this app is the off-line mode isnt available unless a flag is generated by the OS being in 'Airplane mode'. It will tell you it can't translate because of a lack of a connection, but the instant you put it in the airplane mode, it works. How about triggering the off-line mode instead of the stupid message?? added 12/16.... STOP changing the text I typed in !!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,In the past when tap to translate is on whenever you copy a text the floating icon shows up for a 2 seconds in case you wanna translate the text that was a great feature and fast and very helpful. Now you have to keep the floating icon on to use it or turn it off from the notifications bar which is annoying it will be great if you bring back that feature and you can add the settings for people who don't like it to turn off auto floating icon showing up when they copy something
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is not well thought through , guys. The keyboard covers everything and it is tiring to move it every time. Before the update my keyboard would change language automatically depending on what language I was translating from. This function is gone now. İt seems that everything useful, that made this app great before, is done away with. I think, you at least need to give people a choice of reverting to old interface. I am very surprised a Google app would suddenly become so bad."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since last update... The translation occurs only 10% of the times with very high latency. The rest of the time it just timeouts with error. Also from the ux perspective, a new page is created with the 'output/results'. But if you made the mistake to select the language and return to the past page, the data is gone and you need to retype it. Hopefully you can add the language selector also in the 'output/results' page."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great app in the past. Extremely useful & un-obstructive until Jan-22. B4 this it was easy to copy text & then the translate option would auto appear on screen. Afterwards you read & make new translations on the fly. Now it's 2 parts of cumbersome. 1.) To use it immediately it has to have a floating bubble that is always on screen most often interfering with the apps it's hovering over. 2.) New messages get lost easily between apps forcing start over. 1/22 update is a total downgrade for me
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was my go-to translator app. Quick, fairly accurate, and there used to be a list of alternative translations along with the definition of the word. After the latest update the additional functions (synonyms and definitions) are no longer there, it just gives you one single translation for every word. The new design is also quite ugly, so really, I see no point in the update. From now on will only be using the web version, this app sucks now"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Though I must confess that I use this app on a daily base to learn and survive in Ukraine, I rate it only with 2 stars now, because of the poor evolution of the development over time and the last totally buggy ""updates"". I'm very dissatisfied and it forced me to roll back to an older version, on android. It crashes all the way, the microphone is not getting properly anymore the words, especially the last one of a phrase. It's a real shame! Besides the phrasebook feature is very badly designed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything was good, but after update, I cannot use it anymore... I cannot select and copy the pronunciation of Chinese words... And its not intuitive with the phasebook now, it takes a lot time to find my expressions. it is totally inconvenient. And I cannot get BACK TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION!!! Now the app is useless for me, unfortunately. I will be looking for the substitute."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great that Google provides this service for free. Unfortunately, they keep stuffing this app with anti features. The latest is an incorrigible nag screen that reminds me to upload my translation history. Google really really wants me to do this. Only way to get rid of it, temporarily, is click ""Manage History"" then press back button. Another 'feature' is a clever algorithm that tries to detect when you've finished speaking while using voice translate, and nearly always cuts me off mid sentence."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I normally use it for English-Chinese translation. Its translations are usually accurate, I think it's very good in this regard. The problem is with the audio. For Chinese speakers, it picks up the whole sentence perfectly. For Eng, it tends to cuts mid-sentence. More often than not u need to finish off the sentence by typing which is inconvenient. Also, previous versions, you could switch languages whilst you're in the middle of typing. This feature is not available in the latest versions"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was a great app, and tap-to-translate was a great feature. Now you're stuck with either having the floating icon on screen constantly, which interferes with your ability to work in other apps (having to move it out of the way or accidentally tapping on it when you're trying to do something else), or having to repeatedly turn it off and on, either of which is a huge, pointless nuisance. The way it worked before, just popping up when you copied text, was vastly superior."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Translates wonderfully! understands user's mistakes and makes valuable suggestions. I'd give it a 9/10. UI is really bad, but don't work too hard, simply use the old one from about a year or too ago. With this one you can't easily reverse translate or access history; favorite languages feature is problematic; offline translation is also. I'd give it a 1/10."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Developer responded to your review"" No, they deleted it. 2nd time now. The apps UI is a downgrade. The main reason being for the alteration of the translate icon no longer automatically appearing when selecting a foreign language text. Now the feature is only accessible when enabled via the drop menu to ALWAYS appear or NEVER appear. I'm not sure why the feature was altered to be less useful than before. I used the app frequently and often. This is disappointing and no longer accessible."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good, but feels like a beta version of the potential. Quite a few bad design choices. One terrible design that makes zero sense is that if you input a text you want to edit you can only do that while viewing one single like at a time. So you try to edit and suddenly can only see 7 words at a time while the rest of the screen goes white. Really makes it unusable for more than 7 words at a time. But it's great for single words."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Disappointing! Slow!!! Often hangs!!! And does not show the full translation of the selected text - especially if the selection is on the the large side. I have had more success with the Google Translate website. I pinned the website to my home screen and just use the website. Disappointing because it does not have half the features of the app, but that's fine because the features do not work consistently, on the app. I really wish Google would devote some resources to make the app better!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You took a good, very useful app, and got rid of almost every good, useful feature it had in order to make it more minimalistic and stylish. No thank you. At least give us the option of going back to the more full-featured version. So many good features gone. Most especially seeing the last several things translated, which is invaluable so often, especially when there's not a strong signal."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be the ultimate tool. Translated between English and chinese literally on the fly. Full 5 stars. But recently the app has become ""impatient"". Microphone stops listening in the middle of my sentence. And the first half it captured is quite flawed with mistakes. One then has to jump in and manually type in the missing words and correct the wrong ones. Actually not sure what has happened during the last updates as this app used to be working just fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google has managed to ruin yet another one of their indispensable apps. translate was one of the most perfect apps they had ever delivered. unfortunately this new overhaul looks bloated, hard to see comparisons, and rotating the phone no longer gives you the full translated display. this is not an upgrade, this is a downgrade in every possible way. first clock, then calculator, then this. what will Google ruin next?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great app. It had a lot of powerful functionality. It was great for quick translation. Now it shows ads at startup, which slows it down. Wasting several seconds during a conversation is irritating. Apart from text translation, the functionality is gone. There's no longer any OCR functionality, the voice recognition is gone, etc etc. This app used to be a life saver for me on trips & when speaking to overseas relatives. Where is all the functionality, Google? Why did you do it?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The translate quality is excellent. 3 stars for that. The UI experience is not so great. The one issue is how clunky the software feels to use. The animations when clicking on the text region feels completely unnecessary and less functional. Two menu items containing translate show up when selecting text other than base language. One of them in the extended menu and other first item. The latter of them works 50% of the time. Can't they be unified?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't want the new interface, it's taking all screen and it's inconvenient to stretch the palm to reach buttons or enter the text back and forth at the bottom and on top of the phone. I want old interface. Hey, just got a message inside Translate app that it works inside any app by selecting a portion of the text and it is supposed to pop up a button or something it just demonstrated. I just had an open pdf in Google pdf reader and there was no options of translation of selected text/words."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Translation requires on the fly proof reading -- that's ok, except that the interface is incomprehensibly awful. Two cramped lines of text for each language stuck at the very top, with tons of blank real estate right below? If i want to translate two sentences and go back to edit a typo, it means trying to scroll that tiny space and drop a cursor. And accepting the ""do you mean"" kicks you out the text and into the copy, so can only be used at the end. The iOS version is much, much better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Until a month ago, it has been a great and useful app! Yes, have updated and adapted to the latest version. Never a big fan of change, but actually works out great when getting use to it. However, have had a recent glitch with the ""Can't translate, check your connection and try again"" a month ago and has not gone away. Have tried on WiFi, network, Googled fixes, etc. No joy. Only works in conversation mode, just not on regular translation (typing). No reply a month ago to feedback."

It's much harder to use because of how oversimplified the UI became. No option to revert back tp the previous layout either. There weren't any issues with the previous layout. Not sure why it was changed to something that looks so different. The only minor issue the app had was the accuracy of translation, not the UI. In the meantime, I'll be using another app. Submitted feedback on the app as well."

Previous version was much better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I will change to 5 stars when the app goes back to old format. Now font size is too big and you can't see both the original and the translation at once you have to scroll from on to the other. And on top of that if the entry is long enough (not very long two to three sentences if u lucky) you cant see the whole translation at once you have to scroll. Which is very inconvenient when trying to communicate with people who speak other languages and you have to keep repeatedly showing them and scroll
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app was flawless before they redesigned the interface. Several key features were removed, at the expense of the new design. What a waste. Don't even bother with this app. Edit: Nevermind. I was able to find my favorite features such as translate using camera or import an image to translate from. They were just hard to find at first, but the app is still good. Definitely recommend."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This latest update is awful, terrible, etc. etc. What the heck are your software people doing? Do they even know? This latest update only translates a few sentences at a time. Then it turns itself off. You can't have a conversation with someone like the previous version where the conversation/translation just kept moving along. The previous format was also easier to use.

This was a great application and very useful. Now it's just frustrating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is good when it works. I wanted it for the speech to text translation, but it frustratingly stops at the slightest pause in speech (like at a comma or a person avoiding saying 'um'). Since I don't know the language, I often don't know where to go back to when it stops mid sentence. It would would be helpful if we had a manual listening option where the app would listen until we stopped it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was happy with the app until now. I need the offline function and it does not work. I have the language files downloaded on internal memory. Permissions granted. If I want to use it offline, I get a message ""no internet connection"". Useless function Thank you for reply. The Airplain mode solved it. The app info is confusing.

The most important function was ""tap to translate"", but now it is gone! and the icon that always displayed on the screen is very, very uncomfortable! Plus, before the program automatically determined if I enter text in Russian - it translates into English, and vice versa. and now you need to manually change languages every time.Forced to look for another app with the ""tap to translate"" function"

Its still useful, but not as convenient since the last update. Before the tap to translate icon would only appear when you copy to translate, but NOW im forced to have it show up at all times if i want to leave the tap to function feature enabled, which is very annoying. Now if i want to use it i have to go unhide the icon, why the sudden bad change?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible update! The most useful feature of the app, tap to translate, is completely ruined. It used to be so simple: select text in foreign language, translate bubble appears, you tap on it and you get a translation. Now you either live with a constant floating icon on screen that overlaps with any other app or with a big notification banner on which you still have to tap to get the bubble and then tap on that and then manually paste the text. I see no logic whatsoever in this change..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The option for app to ""hover"" over other apps is too big so you can't see what you want to translate, and it gets bigger when you start typing. No option to move the screen around or change size. App picks and chooses when to stay open as a hover icon or to disappear completely. Does not really add a lot of ease compared to just using the web version. It could be a really great, handy app if it functioned better. I like the picture translate feature though."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The voice recognition isn't complete. It turns off before you finish speaking. When you try to copy there is a blue bar in the upper part that blocks the words. And there is an annoying switch of 2 default voices in english and japanese.

I can either speak or type into my phone (in app) in English and at the touch of a button, my words are instantly translated into Spanish, viewed in text and also played in audio. My Spanish language skills have greatly improved. This app offers several other languages, as well. However, I deducted one star in my rating due to a mystery HACKER typing a message related to my text. Scary. I alerted Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had no issues with the previous layout and found it to be extremely user friendly, functional, and nice to look at. The new update is absolutely horrible, and took away all of the design language features that the previous version of the app brilliantly executed. Please return the previous layout in some way shape or form. As of recent, the app also no longer saves translations in its history at all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this is a useful app, but it's problems require careful management. when listening for English, it is looking for a British accent (I've tested), and has poor speech recognition for American English. this problem is despite setting regional preferences to American English. to use it well, you must use words that have only one meaning, and a unique sound. My rule of thumb is that if there are two choices for what a word means, this app will pick the wrong meaning about 90% of the time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is invaluable!!! I would be having a hard time in Costa Rica without it. The only drawback is that when using the microphone to say the message you want translated, if you pause even sightly, it stops. Google talk to text is great - you can pause for 10 seconds to gather your thoughts and continue speaking. It's very frustrating when using this app because it's constantly stopping and you have to start over. I find myself using Google Talk to Text in another screen, then copying and pasting my message in Google Translate to be translated. It makes using the 'conversation' mode of the app useless because it's a slow process. Change the lag time to 10 seconds and this gets a robust 5 out of 5 stars from me!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is fine, but there's one thing which is so annoying. Tap to translate was nice before, simple and effective as well. As to the annoying thing - this bubble always on a screen, it was perfect before when this popped up by choosing ""copy"" then disappeared. Please, return this back, most will be thankful. In common, the app is perfect. ;)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The floating bubble used to be very helpful and intuitive. Now it's less intuitive and difficult to use. You have to switch the language back and forth instead of it figuring out that you're switching. It also no longer automatically pastes what's on your clipboard.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I agree with all those suggesting the latest redesign is rolled back. It doesn't work and is unusable. I can't see the translation because the on screen keyboard remains over it and it can take many taps on 'Go' before it eventually moves off the screen. The voice recognition seems to be listening to someone else and only picks up the correct word 2 or 3% of the time. All in all the translate app has been ruined.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update removed a very useful feature. Prior to the update, a translation could be made to display as full screen by simply rotating the device into landscape mode. You could also then zoom in on the translation to make reading easier. Also now to view your translation history requires more clicks. In my opinion, this update is a major step backwards."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app helps a lot, I use it with my studies, but I would like to let you know about one thing that misses the app. We don't have the permission to copy the results of definition of a word given, on the table of the ""Definition"" to do a copy/past, it is kind of if this part was not plain where the text is written, kinda like the text is on an image which can't allow us to do a copy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As someone who used this app daily for almost 6 years, I must say, the latest update is so depressing. Many features are gone. For example, when translating into a language that does not use Roman characters, the Roman characters are no longer visible underneath. It is only possible when you translate a single word..but not a sentence. Also, if I translate into one language, and then simply want to change it into a different language, I'm not able to do so. I must completely retype. And more.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As others have mentioned, the new interface is terrible. Text is very large and there is no way to adjust the size. Have to scroll for the translation and it's not easy to notice where it starts. Recent history no longer on the bottom - separate page now, so more taps needed to get to it. The big new translation button on the bottom just gets in the way - put it in the upper menu bar or add option to clear the field of the source language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nice UI, terrible UX update. Your history isn't displayed as part of the main interface anymore. Why? The real problem is how you access it now. You can swipe down to see it, but because it goes from oldest to newest, you're scrolling through your entire history to get to your most recent phrases. Everything got flipped upside down for no reason. The Messages app is a perfect example of everything being visible and accessible at all times; just make it like that. No need to fullscreen everything"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Translations are of a very mixed quality. Some are just completely wrong, some have the literal meaning but lack the sense of the sentence. On the other hand, translation is fluid and convenient and the app is easy to use and languages are constantly being added. Some languages have much better translation qualities than others."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate helped me so much for years, but there's one bug in the app that I can't stand. If I use English voice input, in multi-word sentences, the last word is almost always dropped. If I say ""It's more complicated than that"" for example, all that's written down is ""It's more complicated than"". Despite my great English, I have doubts about my accent sometimes, but no, if I just use voice input to write ""that"", that's absolutely no problem for the app"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A great app with one very frustrating problem! The dictation feature always cuts out before the end of the sentence! Not a problem when using the website version but this has been an issue on this app since at least December last year and many people having been complaining on the forums about it. Can you please advise if you a working on a fix for this super annoying issue. It's one of the most important features of the app adn vital that it works well. Thank you
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If ever there was a perfect example of when to revert your app to a previous version, this is it. You have overwhelming feedback that doesn't just dislike the new version, but actually can't even use it effectively. Myself included. At bare minimum, you should publish a ""Translate Classic"" or add a feature to switch to classic mode within the new app. I love that you're responding to everyone but many of us HAVE sent dev feedback within the app. After 8 months of hearing us, nothing has changed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The Tap to Translate feature was once perfect. It activated when you copied something. I used that so much. Now you have to keep it turned on every time, even you don't use. There are always two notifications if you enable it. Quite annoying. It was simple and effective, now it's quite bureaucratic. I'm afraid with the next update they'll require a written application form to be sent to Google to translate something:) The app other than that is great, of course."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was extremely useful. But all the current changes, really destroyed everything the old app did correctly, while only improving slightly the things that needed improving. In addition of the things removed, which was bad enough, the user interface is terrible if you want to do anything other than talk. Written phrases have become a chore. No history available, so minor mistakes required complete rewrites, and common used phrases need to be retyped. Oh the list goes on"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. It will be much better if it can add with the words all the different form.( Noun-verb-adjective-adverb). This way the words will not be repeated in the phrase book many times in different forms. Edit: I noticed that there are many words that i add to the phrase book keep on reappearing as non-marked which lead to readd them again and change the order of the table when i expose it to google sheets. It is very troublesome for me when it comes to learn new vocabulary.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great app, the best you can find in app store, in my opinion, and I was very satisfied with it until the recent update. I mainly use it to translate screenshots and images, but now importing pictures is unbearable. It flips each and every image! Your usual screenshot is now viewed horizontally and you can't do anything with it, even read it normally. It's very inconvenient and frustrating, I hope you'll fix it in the next updates. Thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the last update the UI became unusable. This is what you'd call ""form over function"". It looks good, but actually using it is a pain. There's too much empty space and too little information per square inch. With the old interface everything fitted on a single screen, but now you have to scroll down to actually see alternative translations and dictionary definitions. Now most of the screen is filled with empty space between lines that serves no purpose other than making it look good."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nicely designed with many useful features, but be careful of the translations. It will often translate sentences incorrectly, but if you tap ""reverse translate"" you can usually weed out the bad answers. It is nicely complemented by Microsoft Translator. It works best with the major languages. If you use Gboard, the layout will change to match the input language in Translate!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely terrible forced random upgrade. I used this app all the time and never asked for a UI change. The number of clicks to access everything increased. Just one example: when typing Chinese, I have to minimize the keyboard in order for the Pinyin to show. The worst part for me is that when I switch languages, the keyboard doesn't automatically switch anymore. Luckily, I was able to uninstall and downgrade to the previous version. Edit: no history. No instant translate. Keyboard too big."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I honestly can not understand why you thought it is a good idea to add one more step to do, when wanting to reverse languages after already translating something. Yeah the UI look clearer now, but it would have been more useful to have the ""reverse"" button available on the screen, after translating as well, not just before translating something. Now i have to go to upper right, press the three dots then press reverse. Keep things simple, guys."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The sticky notification is unnecessary and clutters up the screen. The handy bubble that appears when you copy text is more than enough for a quick translation. There should at least be an option to choose the interface that users would like, not ""both or nothing"". EDIT1: To remove the notification without losing the bubble feature, turn off the ""Tap to Translate"" channel (misleading channel name btw) within the device notifications under the translate app. The fact that I had to hunt for this setting within the system's settings instead of a simple in-app UI toggle, and that their ""learn more"" page explains nothing about this, I will keep a low rating for this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very useful tool, specially the tap to translate feature. I would only ask for you guys to fix the bug in the tap to translate feature that happens when you try to use this feature once more in a short time period (like 5 seconds after the first use). In the described scenario, instead of showing the translation, the Google Translate app is opened completely empty"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It a fantastic app very keen to test it with some of my friends and in different languages. I found the it translated my Afrikaans (2nd language) to English (1st language) quite well. But it kept typing the incorrect thing in English when I spoke English so naturally the translation came out incorrect. My English is really good not sure if it was my accent. Maybe they can add a learn function so it can work better with different English accents.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The interface has been dumbed down presumably to make it more accessible however it somehow feels worse than before. I only just found the history after months of using the new design. Frustrating! It doesn't seem to show alternatives and different verb translations like before. That was always a useful feature to see up front and seems to have been removed, or neatly tucked away to who knows where? Translations are on the whole accurate. The underlying technology is SUPERB."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good. Especially, while reading, it is easy to translate the words just by selecting them. but the problem is the words didn't appear in the history list. if I select the word on some app, click the translate option and see the translation. That word would not appear in the history of translations. It would be great if this feature is implemented/fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app and i need it every day more than i need water. But it would be great if i could switch between more than five languages at the ""recent languages"" section. Plus the new interface is awful, not user-friendly at all. I can only switch languages before or while a translation is in process and not after. Also I can't see past translations anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now very unpractical. The layout is more graphical but screenspace on a phone is priceless, so why waste space. Why make text so big, in the end you can't see what you're typing. I can't read out the pinjing anymore as easy, while analysing images is even more cumbersome. Also the pinch zoom feature is lost. That was so useful to show. The old interface wasn't fancy, but it was workable. It's time to consider alternatives. Why do they make things worse. They follow a trend...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update has broken the way the app was useful to me: 1. Rotating the screen to landscape mode no longer shows the translation full screen with big characters. This is specially bad for sight challenged people or when reading foreign characters (Chinese, etc.) that contain word-changing strokes or details. 2. Pressing back no longer goes to the previous translation where you can pick from the suggested translations list. This was useful to check for accuracy on some terms Bring those back!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Useful app but voice recognition frequently does not detect my words correctly, which is frustrating and forces me to simply type. Sometimes it correctly detects my words, but then before it talks, it changes them to something else at the last moment. I'm searching for a better app, if it exists. Update 13/May/21: Nothing improved over the years. The app misses the last word I say about 75% of the time which is super annoying, especially since I expect it to happen so I'm extra careful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible new layout and functionality. It used to be very nice. Now, it is really user unfriendly. Selecting languages, changing languages, and history. And it is not possible anymore to select the English pronunciation of the cyrillic translation. Also , the font size is extremely large. It's not needed! It's really a bad upgrade!!! Please adjust this!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have a suggestion. I often use the app sitting across the table from someone, voice to text: voice to voice mode, but we both look at the text -- speaker to make sure he/she was heard correctly, hearer/reader because reading text much faster than listening to voice. We're both trying to read simultaneously. Think about it. Neither of us can read text upside down. So we're constantly turning the phone around, and when we do, the other person can't read. So display one text upside down!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""improvements"" in the last update are annoying. In previous version you could just copy a text and the floating icon would show up, worked like a charm. Now the icon is either constantly on the screen or you need to directly to the app. I mean, who thought people would like such change? Please fix it to the previous version or at least make it possible to decide on upgrades."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So far so good. Biggest complaint is that when using the pixel buds, the volume of the translation voice coming out of the phone is very low and difficult to hear. When not using the buds, it comes out at speaker phone level volume. A fix for this would be greatly appreciated as I will be using this a lot as I will be traveling for work very shortly. Update: Google translate team replied. In the end a shut down, sit a minute, then turn on phone worked. A restart didn't work, which I had tried."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish I had read reviews before updating. The old interface was a bit boxy yes, but very functional and easy to see lots of information, change languages etc. The new one has taken on the lots of whitespace design school with giant buttons, text, etc. Basic functionality seems to involve so many taps. I guess the great news is that I've started to look for alternatives, so thanks google!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It has been okay in the past, but this new update made it so bad I ended up deleting it and using another apps translator. It had it's ups and downs, but now with the multiple translations (male and feminine) and the much larger typing area, you cannot even see what you are typing. On top of that, the ""suggested"" phrases of what you are trying to type automatically change what you are trying to translate, even if it's incorrect. Unfortunately, every time an update is done, the app gets worse."

It used to be better, hench the missing 5th star, but in its current state it suffers from over engineering and neverending attempts to make it smarter; the UI, while simple on its surface, became less intuitive and awkward to work with so it's never clear what language is being translated and which is translated to..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The voice feature is significantly less useful than I had hoped it would be. I honestly wonder why that feature was even created, since half the time it doesn't understand the words it's presented with & I have to manually enter them, which is a huge time-waster. Spanish is an extremely precise & phonetic language, so it really shouldn't be that difficult for the app to follow."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update is terrible and inefficient to use properly, especially if you are switching from keyboard to handwriting, pace is too small and can't be adjusted. Pls change it back 🥺... The way it was it was perfect!!! Efficiency is the most important here...question to the designer did you even try to use the app? So much empty space for noo reason.. and not to mention that you hidden the history that is Verry useful when translating the language!!!,Bad interface!!! How can I turn it back help!?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent change to the tap-to-translate functionality renders the app not just inconvenient, but actively annoying (for what was previously a convenient and useful tool). The floating icon interferes with the ability to access other apps & tools, forcing me to move it constantly around the screen to get it out of the way. I have accidentally tapped it countless times in an effort to get it out of the way. This is a bug, pure and simple, not an update. Do NOT refer me to a forum post; fix it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I need to thank the developers for the fast response. Being in airplane mode fixes the issue I had with the offline translation when using the camera. I assume this appears if you have access to the internet, but not to google services (which can happen if you are traveling to a country with such a restriction). In that case, having to turn on/off airplane mode each time you want to translate something, may be frustrating. The previous version did not have this complication."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WORSE than previous version. Surely nobody wants the floating icon to remain displayed at all times. Hide it after a few seconds as with a previous version. Automatically display it when text is copied to the clipboard (again, as it was with a previous version). Don't require the user to paste the text (you guessed it... just like a previous version). Updates should bring improvements, not regressions. Oh and Google, don't respond with how to send feedback, do it yourself. This *IS* the feedback"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There seems to have been a number of changes which I don't think are very good. I now see ads pop up before and during multiple translations which never used to happen and is very annoying. It slows down the process no end. Also, when entering the word, I get taken to a separate screen whereas before, I could see the translation as soon as I typed next to it. Not a fan of this version. Please remove the ads!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The update ruined this app. I used to use this all the time for Japanese and it had one of the best translations available. Now the camera reads vertical characters as horizontal if they're too close together and the option to select characters manually by swiping has been broken and replaced by two highlight cursors. If I could rate it lower I would.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've chosen the English language region to be United states but the voice speaks British, I tried hard to fix it but couldn't. It's not about that, at first (after having just downloaded it) it speaks in American accent perfectly, but then out of the blue it changes to the British accent, I tried to figure it out but couldn't. Thank you for your fast reply"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app and I used it all day, every day. Now, it annoys me to the point that I am uninstalling it and will suffer through other in app translations. I understand why the bubble changed and I could almost bear that but the app now makes a sound every time I open/close/use/minimize it and there is no way to turn it off without turning off all of my system sounds. So, I'll watch the thread for when/if the app goes back to the way it was (the helpful way) and download it again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great translator app for many dialects. It is better than many dictionaries you find now. It is text based, and also reads it in voice aloud. It is supposed to have a voice input reading feature, too. Only the online version does much. It worked much better on the Android phone than the PC browser window for a while, in some ways. The offline version lacks a lot of the features. That would be a big bonus to add (have the whole thing - at a subscription?). PC already has a fee offline version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just updated the app to the latest version but I regret instantly since the old version was more simple and easier to use compare to the latest one. It also doesn't do its job on the voice - region option (since I am more familiar with British accent so I always change this setting, but this time with the updated version, that feature doesn't work, I keep hearing one that seems to be the default region). So, in conclusion, the previous format and setting options are way better. Pls fix. Thanks"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what they're thinking here with this application but the previous iteration of this app was perfectly fine and worked really well. Translations weren't the best sometimes and, I don't know...maybe you developers should concentrate on THAT. Not always is it good to change in app and relocate everything. It was very easy to use and everything was there available including history which you could just scroll down to see. I expect to see your canned, condescending response below...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When pressing the audio button and it says ""Speak now"", its not listening to the full message before it gives an output, which can lead to some pretty interesting miscommunications. I was testing it with a simple phrase from English to Spanish, and vice versa. (Ie: You have beautiful eyes, and it always turned up ""You have eyes"" LOL). If there is a way to fix this, let me know! I have a galaxy S9 phone. Thanks!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous version's ui was overdue for an update, but this is not what it needed. It's superficially glossy but harder to use than the previous version. For example, the keyboard blocks the destination language, so I can't see the translation by default. That's a huge ui failure (the output of the core function of the app is invisible by default) and wasn't a problem in the previous version. It feels like there is no product manager representing the users on the team that did this work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When this app works it is good, but it only works about 5% of the time. Has major trouble recognizing voice input. Voice output seems to work sometimes and not others. Complains of no internet connection even in off-line mode. Complains about internet connection even when there is one. About the only thing that seems somewhat reliable is text translation and the ability to show a full screen card, but had to be partially psychic to know you have to rotate the phone for that to work. Great concept but utterly amateur execution. Edit: Apparently rotating my phone to get the full screen rotated text is also unreliable. Not working anymore. So other than the translation function nothing in this app seems to work reliably. I'm not sure how software this bad gets released."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new version. First if all, don't force me to get an update if I don't want it. Second, the new floating translation feature is terrible, inconvenient and unneccesarry. And finally and most importantly, why did you get rid of automatic export of text to side by side translation from the picture? It was the best part of the app, being able to copy original text from the picture was really useful, especially since your translations are not always 100% accurate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Glad to see others complaining about the latest UI/big update. I have sent Feedback through this app twice and have seen minor updates since, but looks like nothing has changed so I decided to write a review here. Right now I'm using this app as I did years ago where you have to open the main app to translate a text you copied. That is how such a downgrade the latest UI/big update is. In the time this app was great you copy a text and that icon appeared, you tap and voila you right away you see the translation. Awesome! But now you either have to go to the main app (like it was years ago) or you allow that icon to always be visible on the screen. And even if that icon is visible, you now have to tap and then you still need to press another button (paste) to see the translation. What I would like to add to this, is the way Chinese is now translated. When translating Chinese you have Chinese characters, pinyin and of course the translation. The problem only now is, if the text is a little long, you cannot see all three at the same time. If you want to read pinyin, for example, then the box where Chinese characters are placed in will get smaller and then you won't be able to see all characters. Before this update, you were able to scroll through each individual box and that was very convenient, because then you can focus on specific parts of the sentence where you can see the characters, the pinyin and the translation at the same time. Now I have to constantly switch between them. Hope things can go back to how it was before. Because the app was absolutely wonderful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty good however, when translating long texts, it tends to not translate thoroughly. So both their help link doesn't work, and the ""help & feedback"" gives the run around options, that doesn't help either. There needs to have human support. So until both the algorithms, and the direct contact options are available, I can't upgrade the rating yet. So Google, you need to make those necessary changes!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"From updating to Android 10, the Tap to Translate button will always appear on everything. Before, this key only appears after the text is copied. He is always on the road in a way that makes him very upset. If I choose to hide the button, I have to dig in the ad menu to translate the text. All of this makes it virtually useless. Please correct. This was a great app and it was very helpful. It's just frustrating right now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4/7 Update: They fixed it, it's a new layout but it works! The new update is horrendous, they went and tried to make it look cleaner (I guess) but in the process made it more complicated, harder to find things or change languages, and a big one... When you swapped languages it would automatically turn your keyboard to the language you chose, now it just stays in English until you manually switch. Very disappointed in the new app, I'll be trying to find an old apk to download."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new (ish) interface isn't great. It seems undesirable to have a giant place to type something to translate. It seems more useful to show your translate history. I also liked how before, you could see the phonetic pronunciation as well as the character for Chinese, for example. Now you have to click on it to see that which is an extra step"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, your new update really sucks and is annoying. The interface is not even appealing. The previous version was far better. When I copy a text the application pops up and if I want to translate I tap and it opens with the previous settings I click on new translate then it swaps the languages. With this new version, the application is always active which annoys me the most, if I copy a text I have to click the icon, paste the text, select the language then it translates. If I want to translate from English to another language I have to go through that same process. I am ditching your product these days. you are not making life easier but rather harder and uncomfortable. Your team is failing in the user experience. It looks like your focus is not on simplicity and the user anymore but rather looking for something to add."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for the most part. However, I can't stand the handwriting input. For some reason it only gives you like two seconds to write a character and then it auto ""enters"" even if you weren't finished with that character which is super annoying. I don't understand why there isn't an option to disable this ""feature"" or at least increase the time you have before it inputs what you wrote. Also when using the camera option to translate a picture it sometimes has a lot of trouble focusing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. The only thing missing on phone as well as PC is translating from a picture like jpeg. The playspeed of the app is not adjustable enough. A Chinese in Guangzhou could not understand the app through the phone, but there were a lot of variables including that speed that again needs a few more steps between 100% and 50% Plus the tone of voice changes with speed so ideal it would be pitch adjusted. All that said those are the only issues and I've used and loved the app for 6 years"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for English<>Spanish for more than a year. Recent changes to the app mean it doesn't show the sentence after I type it in on the keyboard for translation and worse - it doesn't show me the translation in the other language. It is all verbal. If you need to see it as most of us do, there needs to be an option to turn that back on. Thanks! Please escalate. Still not working. Development broke something that was working. Tried reading manual, but that's NOT the problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update might be ""good looking"" but worsens the UX terribly. The text is somehow set to a obscenely big font size, with no way to change it back to small. It's making it difficult for me to read. On my phone I have small as the default font size, so you can imagine how I feel. The workflow has been changed, the shortcuts thst I had defined don't work anymore. It probably needed some more rounds of review before being rolled to the customer."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to work until I tried to update the Japanese offline data. When it tries to download the new data it says ""Starting Download"" but it never starts. it just says ""Starting Download"" forever. I have WiFi on and other apps are able to use it. There is 15 GB free on the SD and 10 GB free in internal storage. I've google the problem and tried all the many suggestions. I've tried clearing the cache, clearing data, removing the SD card, rebooting, reinstalling, setting all the permissions to on. I've done them in various orders and combinations. Nothing works. it still says ""Starting Download"". To make matters worse, after all the clearing of cache, clearing of data and reinstalling, I have lost the original offline data I had. Now I have no offline data at all. That really sucks because I'm in Japan and I don't know how to read Japanese. If anybody knows how to help, that would be great."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible new redesign. Especially if you use the floating translation. You used to copy something and it instantly translated it when opening the floating icon. Now you have to paste it manually. And then if you copy something new you have to clear the old one first, paste it and press the send button to translate it. So before you had 1 step now 4 steps. Good progression. To the sup. answer. There is no ""three line menu "" on the top left anymore. Maybe check your updated app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app WAS outstanding. It worked perfectly but after an update the whole feel is off. By that I mean it appears the whole app was refaced. And the real time translation doesn't even allow you to finish 1 sentence before stopping and translating the few words it did pick up COMPLETELY wrong. I mean not even close. I'd love it if I could revert back.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,In my experience the 'tap to translate' no longer works reliably in the current version whereas previously Google Translate did what I wanted to. I know this issue has been answered by Google in response to a previous post but the answer then just doesn't make any sense to me. In settings the only option one has is either to turn 'tap to translate' on or off. I have made sure it is set to on. The people continues. 'Tap to translate' only works intermittently.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New update is a step backwards. Buttons and text are too big for intended purpose. It feels it's only to be used as a tourist translator than a translating app. The placement of buttons has been switched so habitual navigation is annoyingly changed. Some functions are hidden in menus that were easily accessible before. I'd recommend to not update and Google to go back to previous interface. Highly frustrating!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's terrible now. Gigantic and not user friendly at all. It lost its best quality, having the history by default, so you know, you can memorize new words easily! Having all the text and buttons on the edge of a tactile device is a shot in the foot (dumb mistake). How much do this developer make and studied to make such classe A mistakes. ""Leave previous version alone!"""
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A lot of good stuff, but fails on the most important. You can barely paste any text into this app. Google left a tiny portion of the screen space for pasting text. The space left, if you use the app in horizontal mode, lets you see one and a half line at the time; that's all space left for the text. 75% of the screen remains empty, while the text is pressed up in a corner. That makes the app useless for translating sentences that contains more than just a few words."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before it was very useful it could easily switch between the two preferred languages, now if you translate (for example) from Spanish to English, then select to do a new translation expecting English to Spanish (as it used to be able to do) you get English to English and have to waist time manually change it every times... In a conversation it shows a lot. And (in tap to translate) if you miss click even by a millimeter it closes the whole thing and you lost what you wrote. Stop making it pretty"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There was.. nothing wrong with the previous UI. Why, why even change it so drastically? Yeah it may be ""pleasing"" to the eyes, I guess, but that's at the expense of user experience. There's no easy way of finding your history nor changing languages now, and it just shows everything was made with aesthetic in mind, instead of ease of use. Kind of like a model house made as eye candy and not for someone to live in."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The new UI looks awesome. However, as I used to do translation, I always need to check the translated words back and forth with the ""Reverse"" feature (after translation). I think the menu should have been easily accessible, not hidden in the sub menu, demanding two steps to do just that, which is quite cumbersome. I hope it would be displayed as another easy-accessible icon on the right/top. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A good app but doesn't work well with voice input. Overall I want to like the app but I much prefer the online version. It doesn't have the same flexibility but the biggest drawback is the poor performance of the voice input. All too often, it fails to capture the last word or two words that you dictate to it. I would expect something like that speaking a foreign language but it does the same for my native language. Changing out headsets or modifying microphone settings does nothing to help."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Following the recent update, it's no longer a seamless convenient user experience that I've had while translating words. It takes way more clicks to do everything: translate one word, read the translation (scroll), multiple words, look at the recent history, etc. I'm not really sure which user flow has improved. I'm still using it, but it's an irritating and inconvenient experience."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Boy, have I used this service. The app is click happy on my phone, but, provides speedy, accurate translation. (I do find, it changes my word needlessly at times; ""or"" as to why there is a big wasted space on screen, and only a cm to edit words, with the cut and paste constantly popping up. Err!) Nonetheless, I find these type of apps envaluable to communication and learning. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't usually leave feedback, but I really care about this app and I use it daily. The new version is so bad, and was really unnecessary. The usability was downgraded. Some things like history take multiple clicks to get to instead of being there. You can give the option to show or hide instead. Also font size is huge. Also, once I translate I can't swap languages. It's just really bad overall. Please give the option to revert or use classic. You ruined this app's usability."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old worked. But the design flaw was inability to use the microphone to correct or continue the thought.. the microphone cut out quickly and I had to take a deep breath and then spit it all my words in one quick sentence or it would just take one or two words. Everytime I made a, or a. It would stop and cutoff. The new one allows you to use a microphone which is appreciated. However it has tremendous flaws. Unable to share. Unable to see more than three lines at a time. Gigantic tex"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love it, but someone of the app programmers use it? try to translate and correct more than 5 lines of text. it seems impossible in one same row. I'm using a Samsung s8 maybe is that? i can't change the width of the rows to see more text, if i need to correct something in the original text, or even if i want to read a large translation. if you fix it i will rate it as you deserves... i will send you a email because the 'help & feedback' is not so useful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its not that bad but when i try to translate using pictures it is not giving the right results. Also, by voice, it gives inaccurate results. I updated the app like twice but it just got even worse. Please fix these bugs. I even deleted it and downloaded it again 5 times . And please make the image thing come back! It was perfect. This google lens was really a trouble. The more it gets updated, the worse it becomes."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't like recent update either. Now I can't use the app in split screen. When I need to translate, I have to memorize the term/phrase, switch apps, type it in, go back to original app to confirm, go back to Translate to get the translation. (Not all apps allow copying of their text, so copy/paste is not an option.) Hopefully removing this feature was an oversight that will be fixed in the next update. In the meantime, I'll definitely be looking for a translator that works in split screen."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The old version was faster and better. Don't understand the idea of making interface so minimalistic that everything is hidden away and need extra clicks, like reverse translate. Before there was an arrow to click straight away. Now must first open a menu, then click again. And so on. It does it's job I guess but not as easy to use. Don't fix it if it aint broken. Now you broke it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In 2021 this app was terrific. In 2022 they completely destroyed it. Now one year later it is slowly becoming useful again. Why can't you bring back the way the floating icon used to work? Before it was hidden until you would cut or copy text. Also turn off the persistent notification in the notification bar. Most important, when I paste text into the translator and it is set to auto detect, have the output translation automatically change to the other language and not the same as detected."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good translator for most major languages. With Turkish it's not so good! Further the translation window, while typing is only one line on display, though there is plenty of space, as the keyboard only takes half of the screen. Very bad, when trying to type a longer text for translation. The instant mode translator for motion eye camera is good for single words. Longer text are only captured partly and with instant mode doesn't work well. Writing this review, so you guys, can make it better. Thanks!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have successfully used this app for several years. I use it every day as I teach English classes to students in Colombia. However a change has occurred probably due to.an upgrade and the app is no longer workable. Why change something that was good to something that is unworkable. With the previous version I could use ""tap to translate"" in all my apps. I could with two taps translate from Spanish to English and also translate from English to Spanish. It was a fantastic app but now is unworka"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version sucks. Before, when I was on the last version from the play store and it worked fine. Then the UI clearly changed in the new version. Alot more work to make it work. Just not worth using. It no longer auto-pastes the text you have in the clipboard when you tap the bubble. It opens with an empty window. You need to press a paste button. Can I install the older version until you fix it? If not uninstall and find something else. Update 2/18/2022 Still broken. Give back the old version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be good, however in the last few updates it's leaving lots at the table. The icon won't stay put on the screen, the translations aren't always accurate. I have to turn on the icon each time i want to use it. I hit the slider to keep it on the screen but invariably it's gone in a minute or two. And then i have to keep doing it over and over. There are times when I'm using the Gboard translator and it goes nuts and starts typing crazy things. I was very happy with this before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is now a fuzzy shadow of its former self. It used to be so intuitive to use including the ability to quickly translate back and forth. There was also a useful rolling history of previous entries. No longer provided. By all means develop new versions of successful apps but please allow users to stick with the original version which worked so well.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this application many times per day and I was happy how it worked. After updating, I got disappointed. Practically tap to translate doesn't work. To have icon on the screen all the time is disturbing. However, in case ignoring the inconvenience and keep the icon on the screen, doesn't make the translation process easier. The copied text does not appear on the application automatically. It necessary to paste. I will wait hopefully for new update and improved tap to translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new update is TERRIBLE. the font is so huge it takes up the whole screen so it is not possible to view a sentence. You must scroll down all the way to see the translated part which is the important part in the first place. It is completely nonsensical and NOT use friendly! The old display was perfect seeing both side by side. Consider this app deleted!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The floating tap to translate button used to be great. It would appear when you copy text to your clipboard and when you tap it, it reads the text and translates it automatically. Now it's always on screen and more an inconvenience than a convenience. Edit: no that does not help. I know how to dismiss it. The feature is just useless now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Something is wrong with the translatation using scanning option. I never had this issue before... Now it is unable to focus on the picture and hence, the picture is always hazy, so it cannot find text and translate. Very wierd. It's not an issue with my camera, when I switch on my camera normally it does not have a focus problem and I can click a very clear picture."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using it since before 2010 or so. All downhill since then. It used to be nimble one-hand operated app that one could rely on while travelling, the camera option actually worked, and fast. Now it might have neural networks and whatnot, but it's pretty horrible to use and camera part is a mess - what use is it if only every 5th word is translated and even those are flickering on-off?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The 'Tap to translate' feature is very useful. The only drawback is that the icon and its touch catchment area are unnecessarily large. As a result, the icon often gets in the way when I try to use the screen and it's rather annoying. Can you please reduce the icon size and the tap catchment area, and make it possible to minimise the icon to one side (like turning it into a thin line)? Thanks"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I do the image scanning translations it is always buggy/glitchy and doesn't work properly. Between translations or when doing another scan-slation right after one, the picture, the whole lighting as a whole is always extremely dark, so I cannot scan for a translation. I have to go back and try again. It is also sometimes way too bright. I think it's the exposure or something as well. Going back or restarting the app usually works, but it is very inconvenient. Please fix it. Thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is overall a great tool, but I really dislike the layout of the new update. The new ""enter text"" area is way too large, and blocks out the previous translations that used to be listed below the text box. I find that the previous layout required little/no navigation and displayed all information on the main app screen, it was streamlined. I was unaware that I had auto-update enabled, and so unfortunately, the app has updated itself. Is there any way to go back to the previous layout?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate doesn't work anymore as it used to be. The idea of tap to translate was to have an INSTANT translation of the copied text. Now, it makes no sense; you have to clean the past translation and past the new one. Thank you, I also know how to use standalone apps. And ""translate"" option in the context menu for selected text does not appear everywhere, even not in the native Googke apps like Gmail. Other app I use still do it properly. So, it is not a system limitation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I had used many dictionaries in my studies and found that Google Translator is one of the best. It shows the meaning in the language from which you're translating and gives you ample of examples. It would be great if they can fix the tap-to-translate. When I read through ebooks and copy a word to translate, it works fine for the first time but opens the app when tapping again for another words within seconds of the first time. It really distracts me as I have to go back again to the PDF reader."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an excellent tool for much needed translations on my internet researches and book (ebooks or physical formats) readings, the best source of information is always in the language of the subject itself. I also use it as a grammar, dictionary, and for ideas when I write something. Deleted all other apps on the subject. In addition, it's very intuitive and anyone can use it, even if it's not familiar. If I could as a beginner, so can everyone else. It's the app I'm with since the beginning."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The former UI was much better. The interface should be simple and static. The user enters text, chooses a language - done. But you had to show yourself and make a footprint, didn't you? You added text fields which don't work right, you can't easily edit the text entered. The interface completely changes when switching languages. The double headed arrow to change the direction of the translation is missing. I am forced to decrypt your thinking every time I use the app. Annoying"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is good at translating WRITTEN Spanish to English. I am currently learning Spanish but sometimes have a hard time understanding the person if they are SPEAKING quickly. I tried using the conversation aspect of this app on several occasions on my trip to Mexico but found it was only able to pick up a word here or there, even if I had it on Spanish instead of Auto and if the person was closer and spoke slowly. I was able to translate it better than the app at that point, which is redundant. 😒"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"To a developer's response: Thank you for your reply! In the past I was able to copy anything from any app or website and I the floating icon would pop up (if enabled). This allowed me to click it and get an instant translation. Also, I could close it or ignore it and it would disappear. Now I have to keep it always on, or it doesn't work. Worse is if I drag it to the bottom of the screen it is gone forever unless I go to the app and turn it on again. It also doesn't auto translate. :("
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's alright. Nothing new to say other than what most people are bound to say about this app: it is the best out there as of now. However I do think it'll be much better and easier to use of you added a toggle in the quick settings menu in the notifications drop-down shade, like in Shazam. That would enable us to translate audio playing from other apps on the phone such as Instagram, for example, and/or allow us to get translations in real time when we are conversing with other people without having to open the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good apps. But it can't exactly hear what I was saying properly and it ends up mistranslate. And, the import pictures are also something that's been kinda weird. I was pretty sure the words are crystal clear but the meaning results are still blurry and sometimes, absurd. It's always been my major problem honestly. I hope you can improve better in the future."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In the past, tap to translate would always work in the background. I would simply highlight a text and a ""Translate"" option would appear. Now, in order to use tap to translate you are required to have the Tap to Translate bubble on your screen the entire time. This is a problem because often times I am trying to tap something else on the screen and I cannot. I shouldn't have to move something every time I need to use my phone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This was my most-used app thanks to the tap to translate feature. I moved to a country where I don't speak the native language so this was so essential. This update made it so much more complicated. Edit per your response: I know I can dismiss the bubble. This defeats the entire purpose. Why can't the bubble only appear when I copy text as it did before and disappear after I translate it? Copy/pasting now takes much longer with more clicks. It was an amazing feature and you ruined it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The other reviews aren't exaggerating, this newer version, interface and functionality is much worse. Pop up translation bugs from time to time? Okay let's keep it on the screen 24/7 on an enable/disable setting. The old one was so practical, this looks like an attempt to look fancier but also be convoluted. And you wonder why people opt out of updates."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The camera functionality is now much improved over older versions of this app. I can take a picture of a whole page of text, and then scan around translating individual words as needed. However, it would be even better if we could select a word, choose ""Send to Translate Home"" to get more info about the word, and then go back to the photo. Right now, after ""Send to Translate Home"", we have to retake the photo, which interrupts the flow."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Like everything else Google does, 'improve' means several steps back. Android Auto used to work just fine launching when I turned on my car. Even a year after it was supposed to be back, nope. Same for translate. I spend twice as much time picking the language as I did before. It doesn't figure out I'm only using 2 languages, but let's show options for 200."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UI ""update"" is ruining this amazing app. Can't one-tap copy and translate, icon blocks the screen all the time (not just when you're copying), multiple taps required to translate/switch languages/view history, empty space where there used to be information (like history), font size huge and awkward for more than one short sentence, the list goes on. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Don't dismantle the features that were working perfectly before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Maybe it's just my camera but the app definitely doesn't work like the advert implies it will. It doesn't do instant translation and the translation it does offer when I type it in manually is woeful. Edit: for posterity, I was wrong about the app. Turns out I had to download a file for the specific translations. It works just fine now, although the translations can still be a little dodgy. I'd recommend the app though - for translation it's the best I've found."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google, what are you doing? I loved this app because it was simple to use and had features none of the other have. The fact that I could copy text and the floating button would appear for me to translate was perfect. Now the floating button is there all the time and only opens up the window and I have to paste and press translate means it takes 5 times longer to translate anything. It also appears that the floating button turns itself off at random times and I have to turn it back on from the Google translate notification. What you have done with Google Translate is make it unusable through the Android app. Now I have to search for a translation app that has close to the functionality that your app had until you removed it in version 6.28. Feel free to contact me for clarification."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Galaxy Note9 user. This app used to be a breeze to work with. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the facility of use that it had. I cant get anything to translate. I highlight the text and the option to translate us no longer there. I have restarted my device, I've completely turned it off and on, uninstalled and reinstalled the app itself, all to no avail! Super frustrating. It used to be seamless. I dont recall making any system changes that would affect the app and I cant see anything currently that would cause it to fail. Just disappointing overall with something I used at least a couple times a week that no longer works."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been working with this app for around three years but recently the android version have some bugs. The writing place is so small and words cannot be double-click selected, if i go out of the application and come back it restarts. I really appreciate the app, have saved me in many urgent occasions. I'm hoping for it to get the best features. Tnx."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was great, but the update has made it much less functional. The buttons are hidden from the screen, when you translate it doesn't automatically go to your translation like it used to. I mean, maybe it looks more visually pleasing, but the point of this app is not to look good it's simply to translate and show it clearly, and you made it clunky, so I spend more time scrolling through it. This update was bad and whoever programmed it should feel bad"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: I tried all your steps listed, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but it made no difference at all. Still very buggy. It always cuts out the last couple of words when speaking to it in English, but it seems to only do it when translating into particular languages. With some languages the speech recognition works fine. Also, when you press the mic icon, often the entire text box disappears, so you're forced to restart the app. That's very annoying. (I'm using a MotoG5s)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After it had been updated, I couldn't translate and save words. But it's been fixed and I'm happy with the new design and functions. It's been working great for a couple of days now🙏 I was wondering if the possibility to see not just the synonyms but antonyms. Thank you for the new look and fix, Google😌 It needs some fixing still. I can't seem to make ""saved transcripts"" work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Prefer the older version. Pros of the new version: appreciate that modern UI/UX design; Cons: The latest one does not have auto-correct suggestions when we spell a word wrong. Secondly, in tap to translate, when you hit the ""translate"" button and the ""pronounce"" button immediately, the pop-up just goes away Moreover, there's not a button for us to switch/swap the language in tap to translate. Finally, please bring back the auto paste from clipboard feature, that would be helpful and time saving"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new format is terrible. The text is so huge that if you have the keyboard on the screen, you can't see the translated text. Many things that were automatic before like auto paste of copied text, auto reverse of languages when you selected 'new translation' - are all gone. This was a very polished and extremely useful tool. Now it just gets in its own way. Unfortunately it is time to look for another translation tool."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be my favorite translation app, but not anymore. After the latest update, it became slow, and translation wouldn't show instantly! Every time I wrote a word, it didn't show the translation. I even thought that I misspelled the words and had to double-check!I also thought there was an issue with my network, but it worked and still works just fine! Please fix it and bring the old one back!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is HORRIBLE. It used to be a great app.. Now it's doesn't save or show past translations, and it constantly deleted the text you typed if you accidentally hit the wrong button (I still don't know what I'm doing so this happens, I think it's the next button on bottom right).... I used it all year while traveling now it is a nightmare"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app helps me a lot learning English, super helpful and very easy to use. I don't know why but about a month, this app has been so slow. When I try to translate a new word, it loads much slower than ever. It was super fast translation, liked showing the results right away. I still trust and only use it but I feel very annoyed waiting. Please check and fix it. Thank you so much!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I try to take a photo and translate a text on it, Translate requires that I allow Google Play to access Microphone, Phone, Body Sensors and SMS. What? Really? Is not it ridiculous? Instant translation works, but it is garbage. Also when I input Japanese characters by hand the app does not give me a second to look at the text, but the characters are quite complex and need a couple of looks to finish. Translate simply incorrectly recognizes the half drawn character and I have to start again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, works ok, but does not provide the same features as the web version. It's not possible to translate full web pages. In-place translate works only for a limited amount of text a time (in general, about two sentences). Downloading offline dictionaries doesn't work (gets stuck on ""Starting download""). Live camera text translation is not perfect, but works much better than expected."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new version is actually ""prettier"", but it's sad they sacrificed the functionality. It takes forever to translate a picture, and it doesn't even read it like it's Thai or Russian and the app just shows numbers or a black screen. The same goes for the other options, you have to type it in order for it to translate it properly, and still it takes too long to translate four sentences. Fix it please, it's a really necessary app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please bring back the old interface. The new one is harder to read, wastes a ton of space with the huge font size, is missing a quick button for handwriting input, harder to read language selection buttons, requires extra clicks to see the translation history... All around worse. I actually can't think of a single thing that improved. I'll use alternatives if I can't sideload an earlier version. Same feedback already sent in the app. Why do UX designers these days promote shiny over functional?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice. It wasn't working offline, I went to apply the tips the developers told me to do, and for some reason my app had a problem: all the dictios had disappeared! And there wasn't a list of languages or anything. So I made a new install and it's working as intended: perfect! A long way from years ago when translations didn't make sense sometimes. It's unbelievable how accurate they can be now...almost always. ;-)"

I usually don't bother writing reviews but the last major update early this year has got me really rattled up and frustrated. Using the app since then is so much more time consuming and it's user friendliness has gone right down the drain. Please, seriously consider bringing back the tap to translate floating icon that appeared after text was copied."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible visual design. Too many taps needed. Too much empty space. Reverse translate hidden away under a menu. History doesn't properly save every search. And not related just to the app but to the whole google translate product: you still can't pick a number of favorite languages that will always be at the top of the list. I use more than five languages regularly, so some are always left out of the 'recent' list and I have to search for them every time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Last update is a huge step backward. On the old version, to translate from a picture, you used to simply browse your phone folders for the specific picture you wanted to translate. Now instead, you get a single list with all the pictures and images on your phone.. Now, its not so bad if you only have a dozen files on your phone, but I got more than 1000 pictures in a dozen different folders. Something that used to be easy and take me 30 secs to do, now takes a couple of frustrating minutes."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last update was a mistake. I guess someone had the idea of modernising the look - only at the expense of usability. You need to swipe a lot to find the right definition. Deleting your search requires an extra step: tapping the word before the X appears in the corner. The tap to translate does not always display the correct translation, but the real app used to be easy to open by tapping Google Translate on top. Not anymore, now you need to tap the three dots first. Why such stupid updates?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a big fan but uninstalled after many years. The new layout has everything taking up unnecessary space, dumbed down giant buttons, counter intuitive, over emphasis on functions like speech and photo which I never use. Minimalism has everything floating in an empty void instead of the old boxes with clear functionality, no hierarchy, hard on the eyes. Don't fix what isn't broken, at least include an option to keep the old version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate worked great for years, living in a non-English speaking country. But now, it seems that the format got wacked/upgraded a bit from simplictic to not so quick and easy to use. I go to the market now and have to fumble around with this app while people are waiting are around for me. Very embarrasing for me when the app was quick-draw and simple. Trust me, I have practiced with this new update enough. I used to be in/out quickly with the old format...now I hesitate to go anywhere."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So Google wrote me back because my review was bad. But they didn't address the issue! I used to be able to select and copy a text in a different language. When I would open the Google translate app using the floating icon the text would automatically populate. Now it doesn't do that anymore. There's always two to three extra taps now. Seems small but when you use translate as much as I do those three or four taps easily become over 200 in a day!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really loved this app's ""tap to translate"" feature and used it all the time, but one of the recent updates really ruined it for me. Previously, the floating icon would pop up if I copied some text and I'd see the option to immediately have it translate what I copied. However, now the icon either needs to float on my screen all the time, or I need to activate it in the pull-down task bar of my phone or open the app completely. It used to feel like a handy feature, but now it's just a hassle."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am disappointed with the new update, previous version was much better. I use your app mostly for learning languages, before the history bar was perfect, on the main page, by clicking on app, and scrolling up and down, I could see transaction history bar, with words and short expressions those I constantly reviewed and repeated until I remembered it, and I could delete any unwanted. Now it is not possible to remove unwanted translation from History bar"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good for text, but slow. It doesn't pick up audio or anything majority of the time unless it's completely quiet in the room except for who's talking, even after you've downloaded a language to use offline. The audio just doesn't work usually. Overall it's not good when you need a quick translation to help with customers if you need to use it for that."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It seems like Google Translate has been updated. Unfortunately the update is a very poor poor poor app and not easy to use.. It's very clumsy and very unsatisfactory and uncomfortable.. Besides all of the very obvious things when you go into it as far as using it as a translator, It is extremely uncomfortable. One of the features that I miss the most is the tap on feature. and have the little Google Translate icon appear in the upper right."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Useful but not fully trustworthy, and a pain to use on my phone. On my S8 the window for editing the text shrinks down to practically nothing (just barely 2 lines of text visible), making it really hard to work with. Also sometimes when I type the whole sentence the app doesn't translate a word in the middle (usually one I need) but when I delete part of the sentence sometimes it translates that same word. Also doesn't translate grammar well if the construction in the first language doesn't exist in the second. If the translations it gives to English sound so rough, I don't trust it to translate correctly to another language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it works for a few seconds then it stops translating... it is not easy to use in fluid conversation well, it does not work most of the time and some of the translations are off. it works fine in the US but anywhere else it doesn't work even when you have great data speeds basically it's useless I am going to get a translator device those seem to be better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to be really good smooth transitions easy to translate back and forth with suggested button clicks. Deleting your history so you can free up space was very easy. Now you have to jump through five different screens to delete your history and whenever you're translate you have to click three or four different things just to translate every single time. Thinking of uninstalling it permanently this new update is terrible. I wish they would bring back some of the old features.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"💋 This app was highly recommended to me by a Chinese friend. I had used it previously, before your improvements, to locate industry specific words in the languages in which I am already fluent. I found it inadequate. I am pleased with your new edition of this app & recommend it without reservation to anyone seeking to master languages. Better communication brings people together in the nicest ways. Keep up the good work, keep innovating! 👍"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before the update I'd make a 6/5 star review. It was perfect. Until the update. Now it's easily a 0/5. ALL the UI is gone. You can't do anything anymore. Gone is fullscreen mode, reverse translate by Mic, and everything else. They literally removed all the functions and left us with a linear translation device. I wish they would've sent a survey, or at least not force us to update. I spent years learning to use the UI. I can't even start over bc there's nothing to even learn on the app anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a really good app, but with the last update, the design of the floating icon was redone. Before it was very intuitive you could just copy your text and then open up the floating icon and it would translate it for you automatically, I don't know why but that was taken away and now you have to push two more buttons to translate things and it's not as intuitive. Please bring back the old Google translate!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a none Spanish speaker living in Ecuador, Google translate has been indispensable while I'm learning Spanish. Until this last update. It seems to have lost the words I've been learning and use most frequently, voice recognition has deteriorated and worst, it has lost the downloaded dictionary and can't be used offline. 85% of the time I need it, I can't use it. Really disappointed. Going to have to find a new app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just in one update, you ruined the whole app. Now, the floating icon stays on the screen, previously it used to disappear after 5 seconds. Now, you can't switch between languages while writing inside the app. Now, when you select a text and press the icon, the text is not automatically pasted inside the app. Google, did you hire Facebook developers?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app except one thing... I need translation for Portugese from Portugal, NOT South America. spelling and pronunciation is totally different for a lot of words and phrases and is making life difficult for me here in Portugal. There doesnt seem to be any apps at all that do this but I would have at least thought Google would at least provide both options."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. I really can't do without it for my daily communication in English et en français. It help me learn more words quickly since am able to quickly look up meanings. I would like the team to increase the text input area height when typing because it just too small just (2 lines). There is no point to the entire empty space down there that does nothing and it makes it difficult to edit a sentence without deleting more words because you can't see more lines. Anyway it's really good.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is awful. Tab to Translate no longer works. The color mode can not be changed. I like dark mode for my phone menu, but light mode in the Apps. Copy and paste have become harder. When it translates, it goes to a new page, and I have to go back to main page for a new translation,and this is unnecessary, strange mistakes occur in translation and it does not translate some part of the text at all! The previous one was good. Why did you change it and make it so hard to work with!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app for years and it was awesome. But in the latest update, there are many troublesome things. Like removing the translation feature after clicking Copy directly. That bubble stays on the screen all the time and is not translated when copying and clicking. The application is also very slow. Hope you fix it as it was in the past. So that bubble does not appear except when we click on copy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Despise the new UI. The history is much harder to look through. Great ""improvement"" (sarcasm expressed) Edit/reply: i did not have to use that step to get to the history, it was perfectly obvious to see and understand in a list for before without having to open a sub-menu. And the previous method to look through translation history was in a newest to oldest order, but now it's in some new kind of order that makes it difficult to look through. Completely unnecessary update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The latest update is unintuitive. Floating icon no longer appears when you copy a text, setting is either gone or always on, which doesn't make any sense. The settings for tap to translate also doesn't make sense. It should be language of what you translate the most often, and should allow for detect language. This new update is clearly used by people that don't translate often, or just really didn't think things thru. Goes against being intuitive on the outside, complex behind the scenes."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand the creative movement of keeping the floating icon on the screen and there is no option to return the old state. When I pull the icon down to close it, it never reappears. Each time I had to reactivate it, close it, reactive it.... Is this the way you do things better? It was very logical in the past, you click Copy text, floating icon appears for translation and then disappears."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used Translate for a long time and mostly had good experiences. However, I recently updated my phone to Android 9 (loved 8; held on as long as I could), and now Translate barely understands a word I say. I used to be able to speak full sentences, even paragraphs, in English or French; and Translate would recognize almost every word. Now I speak a sentence, and it catches one word most of the time (usually the first), sometimes a few. Never yet the full sentence"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update the app no longer retains the phrases which are looked up, so I now can't keep a useful little library of things that I want to say. Therefore only three stars, because it's tedious having to look up every single phrase all the time. Correction, it's still possible to save phrases, but you have to tap the star icon instead of it being automatically saved - still more fiddly than it used to be, and not as user friendly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Always floating tap to translate kills the whole purpose of convenience. Please give the option to hide it otherwise it's useless. Update after response: While I appreciate the concerns of security the dot can be much more subtle, almost hidden to the side or semi transparent for example. I don't think it's impossible to make it more convenient. Unless changed my rating is gonna stay the same unfortunately."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very clunky. Used to be an easy app to use. Now it's all clunky and need so many more taps to get to what you wanted. Doesn't automatically switch between your language and what your translating. The button layout is not very good. Your first instinct is to hit the new translation button instead of the translate button. When your holding a conversation with someone in a different language the app should switch back and forth on its own.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was a great and helpful app before. Now, it's terrible. Before when you enable tap to translate you would copy a word and a popup appears, you tap it and see the transition, and it goes. Now... First you cannot get rid of the bubble. Then when you finally do it, you don't get it back when you copy. You have to go to the notifications. Until then, every few moments there comes a notification that ""tap to translate"" is active, no matter what you do... And when you finally need it... It's gone"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"v6.11 (2020-09-14): Translate keeps locking up. Type input; translation appears on the line below. But, when I touch the white arrow on blue on the right, app locks up; the data is deleted and input is disabled. Way out is to go to [Settings] | [Apps]; the do a forced stop; then relaunch Google Translate. When the app reopens, the offending translation does not appear in history. However, it works then as expected; but the issue recurs at next translation. 😡 This is massively frustrating. 😠"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I used to like this app. It doesn't always have the perfect translation, but that's to be expected when translating Japanese to English as a single Kanji can have multiple meanings as well as particles etc. My issue is with the fact that I cannot use this app like I used to. It used to work when connected to Wi-Fi and offline and now it only works on my LTE connection. That means if I decide for whatever reason to cancel my phone service I will no longer have access to this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is garbage. Text is too big; hard to read and not intuitive to SCROLL for translation. I use this nearly everyday; when someone types a reply they hit the ""English"" button thinking it's the translate button. People don't scroll for the translation. Old version people could read your long message as you typed, now it's hidden behind the keyboard. ""Speech output for Portugese unavailable"" BS I was using it the last 2 months and it's still in the web browser version. Please revert."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app itself, been using it for years. I've dropped a star because the new updated layout is not user-friendly at all. Please bring back the previous layout. I liked the option of switching languages with a touch of a button after the text was pasted. I can't do that with the new layout!! I have to do it prior to pasting or typing the text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You've completely ruined this app. The bubble that would pop up when you highlighted text was so convenient. Now it doesn't recognize text on the screen. Ex. I highlight German, but it acts like I highlighted English. It used to work with Duolingo. It would recognize the language text and automatically switch between English and the language perfectly. Somehow it knew which keyboard was needed. Now that's broken, too. Everything is broken. And yes I'm using the latest, I'm latest update! 😡"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Who could have thought you could destroy such a basic app. The new update and layout is horrible. You changed a very simple, minimalistic design to a horrible scrolling design that is so difficult and impracticle to use. It's so hard reverse translating and switching languages. Good example of don't change something that isn't broken. Wow! You are trying to reinvent the wheel."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Photo OCR scanning is great for finding text within a busy background. It's almost like magic how well it works!! But I've asked this before and asked on the forum these tech reviews get directed to and got crickets in response; for Asian languages there really, seriously needs to be a ""force to only read vertical"" option. Otherwise there's a high chance of text blocks reading horizontal, leading to a failed scan. And that makes the app useless for vertical oriented scans. Please, PLEASE fix?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The older version was great. Just about everything that was changed made the app more difficult and/or irritating to use. Floating button-who wants to be constantly moving a button so they can access their material. Button only needs to be there when sections are highlighted and invisible when they're not. Easy flip between languages in t-to-t by means of reversing arrows, gone. Now you have to select languages from 2 pop-up's to reverse languages. Irritating and time consuming."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's OK...ish. works quite well translating English to Portuguese. However, sometimes it does get things wrong and my in-laws start laughing at me. Good job I'm improving my own speaking skills so won't have to use it much longer. The major fault is that, as soon as you pause to breathe, it stops. Has Google ever heard what a conversation sounds like? People pause all the time! Having to continually hit that microphone button is infuriating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app works extremely well! the camera is very accurate and has helped me translate many Spanish articles from my computer. the translations are instant, and if you're working on an assignment, this app helps you get through it fast. of course though, the translations are not always perfectly accurate, but about 90% of the time they are. In my opinion, not 100% accurate translations are worth the risk with how fast it gives you the translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is terribly nonsense. The ambient change is disgusting and annoying, and the capability of automatic keyboard language change connected to in-app language selection has gone. When you come back from your word it doesn't show the previous word and alternatively the page turns blank. History has transferd in another way. Even one star is too much for this inane changes. You have demolished it and it's not user-friendly anymore as it used to be."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have updated the app 2 months ago and was surprised to see such big difference in interface and lack of options I have used to use. I had been waiting for an update with hopes that the interface will be improved to look like the previous one and later gave it up, found version v6.18, installed it and happy now again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Previously, you could tap the Enter text box, and you would be presented with your translation history, which could then be modified. Now, your history is somewhere else, necessitating more clicks for the same feature. Moreover, the light/dark theme is locked to your system theme, unlike most apps. Yet more regression brought about by changes in UI; companies need to stop changing UIs unless they have an exceptionally good reason"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's one thing it doesn't have that I really want: A constant translation mode for a headset. It'll translate a conversation OK, but it listens, stops listening while it speaks, then starts listening again. I get that you need to make sure that it doesn't take it's own output as input. But a headset solves that, and a constant translation mode would make it usable for watching shows, listening to speeches, and - if both participants have the setup - near real time conversations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works pretty well, but response is unpredictable. Sometimes buttons work, sometimes they don't. Tap to Translate floating button seems to have a sensitive area much larger than the icon, so it is frequently triggered when attempting to touch something nearby. TTT icon is in the way frequently (like when a video is playing), so when I hide it, I cannot unhide it later without completely uninstalling and reinstalling the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update does not work well with images at all. You now have to click and drag over the text you want to copy, but if that text is not well spaced or on the same line it gets the translation wrong. Please bring back feature to select text to translate by rubbing finger over the text of interest. I've installed an older version of the app, but despite unchecking the auto-update app in the Play store, the app still updates. Very frustrated and disappointed. The old version is 5star for me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I mainly use this app to translate screenshots from Japanese to english and it WAS working perfectly a few days ago, but now all of the sudden it either freezes when trying to load in the pictures or it'll just black screen and freeze. I tried restarting my phone, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. It worked with English to Spanish (the default thing it was when i reinstalled the app) perfectly, no freezing or anything."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent update messed it up. It never needed extra stuff on my end while translating. Now i have to go through 4 or 5 steps. The automatic language detection wouldn't change automatically. This is an extra step now. The intuitive app became dumb now. If i made an english to spanish translation, the next one is from spanish to english, the previous version detected it and translated automatically, but now i have to go and select those languages manually. Someone messed up a brilliant app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be great, but the new look is awful. Changing the languages takes much longer and the text fonts are too big. I hope you made this choice in order to make the app more inclusive, because the design is truly bad and wouldn't make sense otherwise. There should be an option to change the font size, instead of just making the app unusable for everyone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I been using this app for more than 4yrs. Quality of this app has gone down by a lot in the past year. I would of give it a 5 out of 5 in the past. But now the translation has more errors, and pronunciations are wrong at times as it's becoming more frequently. Worse part is I can't have the option to make any corrections. I am fluent speaker in Chinese and English, but since I live in US for 20yrs years, my writing skill has gone down. Which is why I use this app to help me at times."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update it's very bad. You can't switch between languages for the same word. If you want to translate the same word to a different language, you have now to clear, change the language and type the word again !!! Very bad ! Bring back the drop down menu for languages. Now is like full screen... mental. Very bad to use ! Who could mess the design??? Obviously people who never used the app !"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The camera option that changes the words on a page is a super awesome idea. It is hard to get it to be accurate. Some of the translations are not more commonly forms and others sound as if one is a child but it better than nothing! So thank you. 2/11/22 update has taken away all the most helpful tools I used with my senior patients. Now they can't read the translation because I can no longer make the translation full screen. The other tools were also taken out. Whhyyy??? ;(
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the tap to translate feature. On my old phone the bubble would disappear after closing out of the translation. On this new phone, the bubble is always there and it is pretty annoying. Please have a setting to choose if the bubble persists all the time or only show up after copying something.

It's VERY impressive, easily the BEST translation app there is. Unfortunately, like everything else Google, it's almost totally dependent on an internet connection, therefore, make sure to find a Hotspot abroad or you'll be stuck with a basic offline translator, which isn't very good."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This used to be my go-to app, now it has been left in the dirt by every single AI assistant I can think of. At least bring back full page translations (white font against a blue background) which were very useful when communicating with someone at a distance. also, not everyone has perfect vision, the idea to make the font smaller as the text gets longer is frankly speaking the dumbest idea from the point of user accessibility I can think of."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new UI that was made some time ago is trash. Now when I'm translating an image, it's impossible to just select a certain section of it because the cursor will grab words from all over the page. It was fine before, why change it? v Of course I know that, but I can't select multiple different lines of text without the cursor freaking out and snatching random bits of text from the whole page."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since the last update. This app is saying it cannot connect to the net. I check all the setting and they are set correctly. I tried Google Translate on the Google search website and that works good. I had been using the app version for 2 years without any issues. Till this last update. It is not my cellphone carrier or the OS. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is a great smartphone. I hope Google will losten to all of use. That have this trouble with the update amd address the issue.

If you select conversation mode and then select ""auto"" mode which can be found at the bottom in the center of the screen of your device, you can have a conversation on the fly in ANY language that you select which is fantastic. It also has no problem using your device's camera translating forgein signs, menus and what not which is also phenomenal. The app is really easy to use and if you download the language, you can also translate it on the fly while offline. This app has helped me learn a few words and phrases in Japanese which I thought was not possible. I love this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The quality of live voice to text translation seems to degraded in quality recently. In the past I was able to play music videos on YouTube and leave my phone by the speaker to get live translations of the lyrics in video. This no longer works. I can see the microphone icon pulsing but no text is translated. This happens even with the language pack installed for offline translation. I think the microphone sensitivity is not high enough. OCR text translation is still very good.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The latest update makes the app useless. 0 stars. I miss the pushing the button and it automatically reads the translation. I've been using this daily with a child and now it's horrible.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somehow no automatic capital letters at the start of a sentence and a space between one sentence and the next one always turns into two spaces in the translation, annoying!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. New UX is cumbersome & requires more steps to get same result as in previous version. 2. When text is copied, the app bubble no longer pops up automatically and no longer automatically translates the text. This was the BEST FEATURE in the previous version. I don't know why it was removed. Now I have to either open the app from the notifications panel and then manually paste the text, or the second option which is having the bubble constantly opened (annoying), tap it and then paste it. Both new ways are inferior and a massive step backwards to the previous version. 3. The text doesn't automatically clear off once a translation session has been completed, it must be manually cleared every time, another massive step backwards in the UX. Conclusion: A once truly great and perfectly functioning app was taken and destroyed. Please fix it. Thank you"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated review: Not changing from 1 star, real-time translation still isn't possible. The app can't seem to handle it. Text through Lens only gets translated once. Pointing it at new text does nothing for long periods, and if you're attempting to have it translate multiple things back to back, it fails. Incredibly poor performance, but they've got the monopoly, so you're stuck with it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great. MOST OF THE TIME. Split Screen mode needs a HUGE improvement--I only ever use Split Screen for the Handwriting function, but... Handwriting works great when in full screen, but complete garbage for Split Screen. Non-existent space for scribbling, and the fonts on the app are so gigantic that it takes up the rest of the Split Screen. (Do the developers even know what Split Screen is?) This app was at its peak years ago, but the revamp made its Split Screen functions unusable."

Also pronouns for the speaker. In many languages, things change significantly if the phrase is coming from/referring to men vs women. Also if people had an option to specify not only past tense, but ancient past, it would be helpful. Edit: I had given more stars, but I'm lowering it bc the reply didn't READ what I said."

I have to take a screen shot of the picture then use it as the one to translate. also if the text in the picture is a mixture of languages like old and current Russian, or German or Japanese, and others, the program only finds 1 language as it requires that you choose a language in the settings in order to use the picture translation. very annoying."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app but there are some problems that I hope you will fix as soon as possible. 1. some languages, for example, Albanian does not have all the words correctly, however, I really like that in some words it says verified by google that we understand that the word is correct 2. when you open voice to record something and then translate it in many cases you have to speak loud and clear for google translate to understand."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Last year(?), there was an update on the camera feature from swiping to select words on a pic > easy selection by highlighting. This function would be good, if it weren't that the scanning ability was so compromised I can no longer make sense of a sentence. There are constantly breaks in sentences because the scan no longer reads it properly. The update was last year, so I thought you wouldve fixed it by now, but no. The camera feature used to be my best tool, now it is my worst nightmare."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is one of my very favorite Google apps. I love it. Use it everyday. I much appreciate the variable speed playback when listening to translations. Slowing down to clearly-articulated pronunciation is a boon. I only wish the float button was more intuitively available to reimplement than the present temporary, dismissible system notification, as it is now 'hidden' in settings, now appearing under what seems to be merely the currently-selected user account. But it is there. Thank you, Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I liked the new interface plus I'd like to suggest some edits. Please add the switching of languages when the text is put. That way it's easier to learn the translations from both languages. Also, the X (clear the text action button) can be somewhere more visible, maybe in the corner of the text box. I appreciate that you keep improving the translations and I'd like to see more effort in Turkish language. That's all for now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have this Superb app installed in my Google Pixel Phone by default. I have been using for last one year.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was very useful at one point. I have no idea when they changed the interface but, the previous interface was far superior. The camera feature as well is now practically useless idk if the detection or technology was different but when you could highlight words it seemed to actually detect them more than it can now. Copying part of a sentence feels impossible now and I still dislike that you can no longer flip translations and get the text to flip as well. App is ok. Was better though."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A great app for translating. Used it all the time until recently it no longer actually works in the background. It now constantly keeps the little circle on my screen and not just when I copy. And until I turn it off entirely will the circle prompt ever go away. So.... you went from a perfect app to a very frustrating one. And I checked the forum as they suggested. No change.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update, tapping on a word to translate (from browser) shows a ""Translate from Portugese"" rather than defaultly translating from English (to Arabic). The issue is a bit irritating as now I have to tap once or twice more to show the full translation information from the English to Arabic language. Moreover, it's been an eternity for issue's occurance of offline translation no longer working after a few weeks. For the love of god, please fix the aforementioned issues. Thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google decided to update the UX and made the application completely unusable for me. The app uses more screen real-estate. I can't see part of my message when typing because it is covered by my keaboard. Other than that, it took days to find some of the features that were relocated. Why does Google suck so much at product management? (responding: I deleted the app, it was usless, maybe you can pass it on)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I seriously hate this new version of translate when it comes to Japanese. Go back the way it was. It's far more functional before then, than it is now. This new version sucks. It doesn't translate a photo copy, you cannot move the blue pointers well, it's more of a battle. Hard to re-translate back to your original language for proper word usage. The original app was far easier before this new version! Please change it back. I cannot go back & see previously used translations. The design sucks!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pretty good translations even with some slang phrases. I appreciate the new updates and features for translating using different inputs. I'm glad the app stopped prompting me to login. Happy I can easily view history of previous translated words and phrases by swiping down. I just wish there was something to indicate that's how to view history. I re-searched words/phrases again because I couldn't find the history at the bottom as they appeared before.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was a great app. In the new version,for the conversation, you need to press conversation section. The only problem with Google translate is that it continues to stop listening suddenly in the middle of conversation. Without any beep. Even sometime after a sentence it stops listening. Which makes a lot of conversation be missing. you need to check and repeat and back your sentences. Which makes it hard to hold a decent conversation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is okay at translating words and phrases from one language into another. There have been cases where it's completely wrong though and I get yelled at by people speaking Spanish. It isn't good at translating from pictures though from not being able to zoom in to avoid highlighting parts of multiple lines at once, which confuses the translation. (In pet sure one time it said ""Apple the pieces into cuts"") Going further, it's not good at figuring out what is and isn't words in a picture."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With some recent update I've lost the ability to scroll across my text input to edit it. This is so frustrating, not just for issues related to translating, but in simply typing anything. Also when I tap on ""Enter Text"" it bring the google acct. Window up. I would immediately stop using any website/app that has this issue if I could. This should be fixed. Also I am using a Pixel 6a."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new UI is so unfriendly, I use this app quite often, and the new UI is very unnecessary, the old look is practical and had no issues, why change it if it's working properly, the new UI imo doesn't look better than the old one, rather than that it looks very repulsive to me. if you are gonna make a new UI atleast give people a option to use the old one."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new UI is horrible! And this isn't just fear of change. Translating back and forth is not intuitive. Coming back and copying and pasting from other conversations is much more difficult. It's like a rogue developer wanted to make it pretty with a total disregard for how actual users use it. Whoever on the business side approved this needs a stern talking to.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app. One thing that annoys me is that Iy doesn't seem to show alternative translations. A lot of the times, a word can be translated to multiple words depending on context. It's frustrating when you are trying to find a word and you know sort of what you expect but can't find it because it o ly shows one translation"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The App is handy to have if you're in a hurry and desperate to try and find a word but it's most often inaccurate or simply wrong in it's translation. In my experience, I believe this to most often be due to the different grammatical structuring of languages and this App's inability to translate correctly because of it. Therefore, often the wrong words are given as a translation, giving a completely different meaning to the original script or, poor phrasing is a result. Camera option is good."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not perfect for all dialects of any one language, but it's not bad for the basics! What I mean is for Spanish people each region has their own way of saying things and you just have to learn how to take your basic knowledge and and it to your experiences!! I'm sure it the same with other people in other countries also, just like English from the UK, to USA , to Australia, and to any where else that it's spoken! This is a guide to help, and it works pretty well!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was amazing, why change it? If something works, don't change it! Wise BIC founder said - When you copy and you open the app, it's doesn't past it automatically. - you don't see both languages at the same time, you would need to past the text, then choose the language, so many unnecessary steps.. - you can't open the app by double clicking, go to the 3 dotes, open in main app.. Please roll back to the previous version !"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This was the best app on my phone a few updates back. Every update ruins part of the magic of this app. No more automatic start whenever you use multiple language formats. Now no floating icon. Translation is slow and often unresponsive. Is there any way to get the version from 2 years ago? This progression is getting worse and worse. It feels like someone hacked into the program to make it useless.

Every time I open the app this happens and it closes."

When I remove it and try to copy some word, the floating button didn't appear like on the Xiaomi A1! Can you please fix this bug? I would rate 5 if you can fix it! I think it's not that hard tho, good job developer!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In previous versions, the tap to translate floating bubble would only appear if you copied something. But now it seems like you need to have the bubble visible at all times in order to use tap to translate. Or you can hide the button and activate it by going thru all the trouble of opening the notifications screen and clicking tap to translate. Make the bubble automatically appear whenever copying something. That is objectively more convenient. The update took a good feature and regressed it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new tap to translate is a disaster. The bubble stays on over all aps, not only when something is copied. The tap to translate window doesn't recognise the language and the new translation button doesn't reverse the languages. It's completely useless for trying to have a written conversation with someone in a different language. Revert back to the previous functionality."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be top notch until you had this last upgrade.... I think the changes made it a lot less efficient. Eg; the 'tap to translate' is'nt as sleek as before, now you have to 'paste' first.... And again, assuming you're translating from English to Spanish and then choose translate from Spanish to English, it doesn't swap back like it used to, you have to go back and change it back(the language, the one beneath) unlike before. Please just bring back the previous version. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some features of the app are very innovative and useful. It has been very useful to me lately. But a very important suggestion is to also mention the gender of the word translated. i.e.,for me,i translate from french to english,but it doesn't tell the gender of the noun which is crucial in French language.Kindly fix it asap so that it facilitates my learning."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The old user interface was much better, and I am used to using it, and access to the features inside it was better. In addition to integrating the translation feature by photographing with Google lens, the application worked well.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new design is unintuitive and broke some functionality. I now have to keep the tap to translate bubble onscreen at all times. Previously it would appear automatically when I copied text. It doesn't do this now. The font is too large. The update is horrible and I hate it. I sideloaded an older version. Edit: thanks for the response google, but the new version still doesn't pop-up tap to translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The translation is accurate most times. The update has broken the app. The tap to translate option is now broken. You used to be able to have a floating chat bubble on the screen, copy whatever text that you wanted to translate, and it would translate it for you once you touched the chat bubble using the selected languages. Now, this option does not work you tap the the chat bubble and it is as if you never copied anything. In addition, now you have to select the language every time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As someone who works with a lot of languages, I usually love Google translate and am regularly amazed by its visual recognition and overall variety of languages. However, recently the app has become more of a nuisance, especially in cases where I need an immediate translation for jobs, talking to loved ones, etc. Half the time the scanning feature doesn't work/can't recognize words. Much of the time the text translation makes me stare at a loading screen that never resolves. Not dependable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app helps a lot. Can you please add the option to use the default voice settings on a person's device. I use UK male voice as default on assistant but this translate keep outputting with a female voice. I want to talk to someone as a man not a female. It sounds weird. This should be something that could have been fixed a long time ago. We all don't have to use female voice.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new layout is confusing and harder to use and Tap to translate is now not as convenient as before. Where before all I had to do was copy paste and it would show up the translation, now I have to have a little ball on the side of my screen at all times just to translate quickly and it doesnt even show the translate immediately. I have to click copy paste and its hard to move and check both the original and translated text. The old layout was much better and simpler than whatever it is now."

However my other apps and browser connect just fine. Yes I have been through all the usual fixes to no avail. Update 10/4 still getting same error. Nothing fixes it. Google is NO help at all. Frustrating since it used to be great!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good with certain things, but I'm really looking for an app that instant translates in camera mode really well. This app doesnt do that barely at all. Everytime I'm holding the camera on a word/sentence it's all jumbled all over the place, it can't focus on the words, there's mixed language in it for example: the word television would have some english and some japanese characters into that one word making it a japanesed english word together which isnt even a thing. This is with anything."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Latest update is HORRENDOUS. **Used** to be an amazing app. Target translation field cannot be edited. It can only be copied or shared. Both field boxes should directly editable. Reverse Translate is inconveniently behind the hamburger button. It should be rapidly accessible. Cannot scroll down to view definitions while editing the text box. Main page has a LOT of wasted space. UI is inaccessible, unintuitive, and inefficient. This is not the Google way."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So many inaccurate translations!! I now look at English explanation underneath instead (thank goodness for that feature). This app used to be awesome, but now it's mediocre at best sometimes. Case in point: AFFRAY is being translated into EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR from English to Chinese, and ANTSY is translated as PASSIONATE...couldn't be more wrong!! And that's just a single-word translation! Try a phrase, a sentence or even a paragraph, you'd die from laughing too hard!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update is horrible. The UI is harder to use than before and despite doing as the comment here suggested, I did send a feedback to express my dissatisfaction on this update, there is still nothing done about it. I do hope they could at least revert it back to the previous version. The camera function is difficult to use, not only it does not translate right away, I had to keep pointing the camera away from any area without words for it to work. All the developer replies are bots, huh?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app just one problem, when doing translation on copy while being on the floating window of the messenger app, google translation appears behind it, and consequently forces to switch between apps. And it would be great to have a favorite section in the source and target language dropdown lists, because if we use more languages than the ones in ""recently used"", they start replacing each other. UPDATE : The app never gets the last word that's being said, as if it stoped recording too early !"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You have REALLY messed this up with the latest update and design. I rely on it heavily and it's now totally useless. You can't highlight text and select an option to translate it there and then. The new floating thing you have is a complete annoyance. And now you can't tap to swap between translate from and translate to anymore. Put it back to the way it was!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Translating Korean to English, on screen instant translator is garbage, keeps switching words and translates poorly, the picture one is slightly more useful, but still needs lots of work and increased ease of use, takes me like 5 clicks to start a new translation and easy to missclick, should be just few clicks. Other than that, I appreciate this app exists and hope for further improvements in the near future for Korean to English."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"** changed this due to their quick reply about a low rating. They are fixing this... Tap to translate used to only pop up on my screen when text was copied to the clipboard. Very useful and handy.

The change on the image translations are fine,more laggy but it works, bring back being able to pick out the sections you want translated in the images, that was very useful. that is all thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This used to be a fantastic app. Used it all the time for traveling. Now I have to physically open up the app in order to translate something I copied. Before you guys did whatever you did all I had to do was copy the text and the app would open a floating bubble. It was perfect. Now the floating bubble is on my home screen and I can't remove it. And I open it up by accident constantly. This used to be a great app. I'll try something different now.disappointed!

I know a little s Spanish, so I can tell when it's a bad translation for the most part, and, as a listening auto-algorhythm, it gets it wrong rather comically quite often, but I don't expect it to be AI. It helps me for what I don't know in Spanish for the most part. Just don't expect its ""conversation"" function to work as a translator for you. That could be dangerous."

It used to be ready to rock with whatever you had copied, now you've gotta do a few extra clicks. To where you could copy, open the app, see it, okay great.

Like if you translate something from English to Korean (not exclusively, this applies to all languages) and you reverse it, the Korean box remains in English, so it's just translating English back into English and then the red ""Translate from"" words appear to correct it. It's easy to correct by copying the original Korean translation, but.....I shouldn't have to do that."

It might be one thing if it's just polishing the looks, but rearranging almost all the butttons location was not necessary. Learning all the new location after getting accustomed to the old position which basically almost never been moved was horrible."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update is rather annoying to use. The text is too large on my phone and makes it rather tedious scrolling through the original text before I can even get to the translation, especially after using the camera function on documents. I probably shouldn't give one star as it's not quite *that* bad, but I wanted this to get noticed. Yes, I have also submitted feedback in app."

While the translations weren't perfect, the original interface was great. The new version seems to be focused more on looks than anything. Difficult to manouver and I find myself touching double the amount of times doing the same translations as before. The new version is a flop, why change parts that were working fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's time to complain. This translator is hands down the worst especially after this new update. My phrase book and all the words I have been practicing are gone. Thank you for that. There's no longer any history of conversations and I still gave to repeat myself half a dozen times. I am officially unistalling this app because there are many others that are simply better!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible user interface! Who designs and approves it? After the new update, everything is just hard to maneuver. The floating window function isn't properly working and it's hard to access history. You just introduce more unnecessary button presses just for some new ecstatic designs. Used to be one of the best applications. Waiting for a while now hoping that you would change or something, but there aren't any changes. Give me back the old design!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the update this great app became a lot worse. It isn't convenient to use, the floating icon with automatic translation either doesn't work or doesn't disappear after the translation & irritates you. There are more bugs with offline translation, and the app doesn't work if the date on the phone is wrong. Two stars only because the translation itself became more precise"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The new version with ""conversation"". I'm using this feature every day but now it doesn't translate from Swe to LV. Only from LV to Swe. And that annoying woman's voice every time when the button is pressed, with no chance to turn it off (at least I didn't find it). It was so simple to use the conversation button but now it's made so complicated. I notice later that there is the gray microphone icon, but then I have to delete the previous translation and press it again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its good. But try to add more language options. And there is the problem with male and female voice. The english voice is always female and the translated voice is always male. There is no option to change it or choose as per our requirement. Please update this feature and include some option to change the translated voice into male or female as per our wish. Apart from this I am satisfied with all other features. Overall, Good app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Incredible hedious update - watch out! This app was working fine. Suddenly, with last update, the font became so big that literally if you type more than twenty words you stop seeing what are you typing! I'm talking unbelievable thing!! The whole layout changed, you can't quickly swap between languages and if you got used to the old layout, your finger by instinct goes to the copy button - which, alas, now is .. new tralsation which means it empties the test box! UNBELIEVABLE UI design, awful"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the last update, all the offline features aren't available and UI is garbage. It used to be so good, why the hell did you had to ruin it???"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google have broken and ruined a once great app. The tap to translate ""show floating icon"" now appears all the time which is very annoying and unnecessary. When something is copied to the clipboard and the floating icon is selected the translation is not shown automatically. Instead you have to click on paste, which is next step. I have now turned off this feature. Because it shows on screen all the time which I don't need, and doesn't work when I copy something and select this feature.Please fix"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I downloaded the app with the expectation that the translation would be the same whether it is in google chrome(online) and as an app(offline). but when I compared it, they were not the same; the offline one seemed to be less accurate(some characters weren't translated and left as is). is it possible for this to be improved? I'm translating Chinese to English. thanks!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Upped my rating from 1 to 3 stars, as history can now be accessed from a swipe down. I'll keep using it. Still not as 'pretty' as it used to be, but works ok. My original text... Updates don't mean better... yes translate is massive, yes it's pretty comprehensive, but the new layout makes looking at your history a real chore. It was much better when the history was just a scroll up. It'd probably be 5 stars but that's progress I suppose?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Works well in a pinch but I have to rely on audio translation due to the font size and background colors in conversation mode. The language you translate to has a blue background and makes reading the characters difficult. Need more contrast (white BG). The font size is too small for most phones and not adjustable. Anybody with less than stellar vision can't read anything on screen I am trying to communicate.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works very well, but since I updated my OS and the app itself, the floating icon is always on my screen and I can't dismiss it (yes, holding the button and dragging doesn't do anything). It was much better when the button would just appear after copying text and then disappear on its own. It's a small detail but it's very annoying, unfortunately."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After using this app for years, i have finally decided to remove it. There's practically every day update at the store, but zero improvements, it's slow and unresponsive at times. But the icing on the cake for me was offline mode; it never works, i have downloaded countless language packages so it can work offline, yet when i disconnect the Wifi and open the app, it immediately tells me that I'm offline, as if, i don't know that, i'd rather open the site from the explorer than using this app..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous versions were great. But now, you can't tap to translate with hide feature. When you activate the feature the button always visible on the screen. But it should be hide until you press the button. It is so annoying and distractor. What do you think when you decide to ux features? It's like we always want to see this. so funny."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be one of my favorite until the latest version, I used to just highlight or copy a text, and see an instant translation within 1 click. If I wanted a new translation, just one more click. Now it takes like 5 clicks to do the same thing everytime. That's tough when you live in foreign country and your wife messages you in a language you're not fluent in. Noooo Google!! Why???? If it's not broken, why try and fix it?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good translator but not always accurate Edit: Thanks that fixes the innacuracy problem, but I have a new problem. I use the picture feature a lot to translate apps with Japanese text because I haven't fully learned Japanese yet. Lately though, I've been trying to translate nice, clear photos and it says it can't detect any words! It's annoying and inconvenient, but at least I can type the characters, although I had to download some new characters for it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was perfect... But after an update, we can no longer seeing the google translate when we copy a text, now either we have to leave the floating icon always on the side, or hide it permanently. Please just returned this feature back. The feature is: when copy a text the floating icon should appear, we don't want the floating icon to be there forever. Thanks"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app for translating on the go but somehow when using the inapp microphone the last word is clipped, i.e. not recorded. A known issue with still no resolution in sight. Example: ""I would like to meet your friends"" is transcribed as ""I would like to meet your"". Workaround : repeat last word of sentence twice or type it in. Really surprising that Google have not yet been able to sort this out. The funny thing is when I use the microphone in the popup keyboard, everything works just fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When using the microphone, if you don't say anything within less than a second or two it stops listening! Or often it just cuts off immediately! Also, it can just cut you off mid sentence! Seriously!? Also, the translate button just says on the screen permanently instead of only appearing when text is copied! I REALLY don't like this change! It's in the way! Does anyone test this before it's released? It has serious bugs."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I desired to communicate with more people from around the world compatently while I learn their language. The app is amazing in that the text to speech can allow you to train yourself on how to pronounce cirtain words albeit with a very butchered accent, but c'est la vie. I find it's interface very user friendly and, there is a copy and paste button at the ready, there are so many more features still to discover, but it is a must have if you dream to understand the world better through language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This update that takes you straight to Google lens is absolutely awful. It is impossible to read Japanese comics or books this way because you can't select lines one at a time with your finger anymore. What an awful user experience that is completely tone deaf from how anyone might use the actual program in reality. Please bring back the previous photo mode.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The translate app itself works fine. But in Gmail, it should be possible to simply highlight text and translate from the list of options. However, it doesn't bring the extra option to translate when text is highlighted. Although I think this feature was in a previous version. In Lens, the UX when the app is launched is not great. Gallery photos shouldn't fill up half the screen when opened, it should just show the full screen of camera. Everytime, I always have to swipe down before I can use it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is ruined with the ""new"" interface. Many features removed or worthless. The write in functionality is most notable, you cannot resize the window anymore for larger writing space. Using this app in split screen mode and trying to use the write in feature makes it only smaller and harder to use while multitasking. In landscape mode you cannot select write in mode because in order for the button to appear, you need to tap the text box; Which in landscape the keyboard covers it completely."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to have while traveling! I always download the language I need before I visit another country. this app was a lifesaver when I lived in Italy. before I could speak the language, I communicated with my friends and landlords with the voice button so we could have better conversations. at the end of each day, my husband and I would study the new vocabulary we'd learned which was saved in our history."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Found APK for 6.27.0.8. Much better. Most of my time with translate is using the floating window. This latest update makes that experience significantly worse. The bubble no longer appears when I use tap to translate and the floating window interface is less useful. It takes more screen taps to achieve the same end result. Please return the floating window to the old style. I'm looking into ways to downgrade as of now. Why do you mess with what works? I will update my review when you fix this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate is a great tool, but the new interface it's a mistake. Problems: - Text size too big - Absence of useful configuration settings available in previous versions - Buttons far apart - Reverse translate button it's hidden in a dropdown - (etc) Would be useful a graphical interface exchange button to adapt to the tastes and context from each user. (I give it one star even though it doesn't deserve it to draw the attention of developers)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible update ruined a good app. I don't know how much they paid the new designer to remove all functionality and stability, but whatever they got it was too much. I wish I could go back because the only changes are removing useful tools and windows, the ability to resize the handwriting pad is gone, multi window mode is now useless and can crash the app. Horrible. I'm editing my review months later, now the app cannot even be used split-screen. Why is there constant downgrades???"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At some times, it refuses to work Internet connection is fine, the languages are already downloaded, yet it just won't translate. It won't when I speak, it won't when I type or write, it won't translate pictures. It's just blank. It happens far more often than it should and is annoying considering the how many of us need this for convenient conversations with those who don't speak the same language. Please fix this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Awful! For some unknown reason the app has stopped working, stating "" Can't translate, check your connection and try again"" I've tried resetting it's permissions, uninstalling, clearing the catch and the data. Reinstalling about four times. But keep on getting the same message. I've sent feedback 6 times, Over the last few months... No response from Google teams. Uninstalling for the last time, will try Microsoft."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Yet another ridiculous update by Google that has broken functionality and ruined the UX. The text on the screen is now enormous so you have to scroll as it doesn't all fit on the screen. And the tap to translate button used to appear for a few seconds when you copied text and then disappear, very handy, now it's floating on the screen permanently or you have to turn it off."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was one of my favourite and most used apps... until it stopped translating images, unless I update to the latest version of the Google app. Dear Google, some of us don't have enough space on our phones for a different app for each and every thing. I use Chrome for Google searching and I don't intend to change it. It does the job just fine. I also don't appreciate being forced to use the Google app by other Google products. I will gladly put 4 or 5 stars, should you fix this issue."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the best translator ever, but some texts cannot be translated correctly. (please fix)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I liked the app for when I am reading a story in my internet browser and one of the characters says something in another language. It easy to highlight and click in the drop down menu to have it translated. Been doing this for 2 years. But since the last up date it no longer automatically trys to guess the language. It use to be pretty good at guessing. Now it just defaults to the last used. This really unhelpful because now I have to guess and sometimes I don't know the name of the language.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The voice translation doesn't work that good. Even when speaking clearly it sometimes doesn't catch a lot of things. Also the camera to translate sometimes doesn't work as well even if the text is pretty clear. Other than that the app works very well and there are many language options and even an option to download a certain language Incase you might not have any internet.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Infuriating that the tap to translate bubble no longer appears. What's going on?! Please bring it back, the app is broken without it! Edit in response to the developer reply: Aha, from the link you provided I gather it's an issue with Android's new clipboard monitoring settings. The auto pop-up bubble is no more. I wish you had just told me that rather than being obtrusive and making me dig through support forums. Very disappointing. The functionality of the app is drastically reduced now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I still think the latest interface change early 2022 is not as good as the previous version. However after working with it i have gotten used to it. Still not as user friendly as the older version. The app itself though is quite good and the quality of the translation continues to improve. Love the realtime translation using the camera. All in all still an good app!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Format change is unbearable. I've been using this application often for years and it's always been functional and easy to use. Now it's dumbed down missing features and difficult to use because of how simplified it is. Atleast give the option to change it back. Or just. Change it back. Don't fix things that aren't broken. I guess I'll be looking for a new translation app or using the web browser version.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version has broken layout, microphone and write button are in wrong place. Also delays during app animations are pointless. Sorry for not being clear. What you replied is the bug, mic and pen are visible and their position is the problem. I'm using right hand and I constantly tap on write button when I want to see keyboard. I downgraded app version to be able to use it again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This version is terrible. It's too layered whereas before everything including history was easily accessible. It's impossible to access examples behind the key board IE the scroll function is wrong,; it's no longer clear where things are or what your symbols mean. I WANT THE OLD VERSION BACK I WANT TO CHOOSE. I'm learning Spanish this WAS an excellent resource including my saved vocabulary which I used to learn from now I have to go into profile ! It's poorly thought out and NOT USER FRIENDLY."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App works well if you're trying to get a quick translation but don't partucularly care if it's the absolute correct one. The web browser version is much more in depth. It will give you the same translation but below it it will describe how often that word is used in comparison to other words, the ""frequency."" Also the app fails to tell you whether or not a term is gender-specific, at least for Spanish. Compared to the web version, I've found the app to be subpar. 5 stars for convenience though!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disappointed by Google's inconsistency & double standards on our language! Also concerned about their so called language preservation program for native languages While they've impressively added over 8 ( MIZO, LINGALA, SCOTTISH GAELIC etc ) languages spoken by less than 4M, Kashmiri, spoken by 9-10M globally, remains missing. This double standard hurts! Let's bridge the gap & preserve our rich language. Add Kashmiri to Google Translate!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app that does everything I want from a translator and more. Easy to use. Databases for offline service available for download. Supports huge variety of languages. Translations are consistently good, far better than auto translation of Facebook and Twitter. Great features that work amazingly well. Can auto detect, highlight and translate text from images and directly from voice input. I could probably use it to teach myself a good bit of almost any language. Worth the occasional ad."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know when this app updated but now there's no way to take a picture and scan it to translate things it just opens up Google lens. Done with this app I guess. Too bad, it used to be good. EDIT: In regards to your response (thank you), I guess you aren't understanding, Google Lens has floating bubbles that completely cover the text to be translated, not allowing you the option to scan and highlight certain individual words of the original text unless you take the time and manually type it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It keeps loading without any results it may seem that ocasionally it just cannot retrieve the info from the server. I type the word in and it is loading but nothing happens, no error message either. Really frustrating. I reinstalled the app twice and after 3-4 translations it just stops and does not want to translate anything. I restarted the app numerous times and the same issue occurs. I have to use the browser version since this is not reliable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The floating icon should be customizable. Such as size and style.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Used to love this app until the annoying notification appear. To developer: I have read your reply to every complaint here but still can't find the option you mention about minimize and something. This update drive me crazy! | Update after reply: I can't find minimize option after slide on notification. But if possible to select text then appear option to translate will help. I added another 2 stars for the alternative solution.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use. Only reason I didn't go 5 stars is because it's wasn't easy to figure out how to save conversations and the feature isn't even mentioned/advertised. Could've saved a lot of time I spent on screenshots if I would have known sooner. Other than that works great and translations, according to some of my Hispanic employees are about 90% accurate or better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Complete disaster with the new Update. I had rated it 5 star, but now I take it back. Very worst user interface, the conversion does not get saved automatically, the voice translation was much easier earlier, sometimes it translates in the same language. The app just went down the hill. Please bring a new update which improves the app, not the other way round."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new looking update is neat but not practical and you feel a little bit tight because switching between languages are small and you need to press on the text first to switch which make it not easy to reach, the history also is not easy to reach while in the older version if just scroll down you will find the history. If you just solve these problems they will make a good experience of trying the app with the new look."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Agree with others - having only the choice to always have the app icon bubble on the screen OR to to have to navigate to it carrying copied text on my clipboard makes it pretty useless for my usage. The bubble icon floating on the screen gets in the way of everything. Alternatively having to take copied text out of the site/page to my home screen apps and open to paste means I loose where I am if for example filling in foreign forms, websites and so on. The new interface looks smarter but fills my whole screen when often I only use it for a few words here and there, it was really perfect overlaid as before - if there was a lot of text to translate, scrolling was fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,After the updated crashes. It works the best of the translators out there. It misses alot of translations. Make sure the other person understands to ask you to clarify. You will get some wierd translations in the speech version so always check to make sure it captured the original input correctly. The update made the app worse for the user experience. Google seems to love to develop a great app or idea. People get hooked on it and then Google changes it or discontinues the app
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but two things could be better. It would be lovely if I could upload an audio note for translation or if the audio function worked over other apps. Secondly, when importing an image for translation, I always have to go back to the homepage of the app to upload another image for translation which is such a tedious process if you want to translate multiple images consecutively."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ive asked all my Latino friends if the Spanish translates well? They have all said its great, perfect. So, Thank You. It helps greatly if you're trying to learn Spanish, as well. I have only used Spanish but I hear good things on many languages! It could not be easier to use. Simply type in your language and it translates into the selected language just below. You can then share thru text, email, drive, etc."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is trash, which says a lot coming from someone who's used the app for the last 10 yrs. History used to be sth you can access easily. Now you need to press 2 buttons to get to it. I used to press the left arrow and go back from the next word to the previous one. Now I go back to nothingness. I saw some people talking abt the camera being bad. It has been bad for a very long time, which is why I just use the app for single word meaning(s), now my experience with that is worse."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Sadly my first review will be to protest this poor revamp of the app that seems to have emphasized gloss over usability. App was very quick and intuitive before and now things have been moved around for no apparent benefit. Rarely seen UX blunder. Also comes with bugs such as keyboard not collapsing on my phone so I have to press an extra time to see the actual translation.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please roll back the Google Lens mandatory update. It makes translating specific lines in articles impossible. The option to highlight text and translate specific phrases and words is by far superior. Google Lens does NOT allow this. Please consider that multiple reviews say the same thing. I have tried to use older versions, but constantly, within minutes, I am forced to interact with the inefficiency of Google Lens when doing paid translation projects."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So frustrating! Transcription usually turns itself off after a couple words when speaking. Also, the app doesn't remember the previous language settings. It always switches to language detection, which is so dumb when you are traveling in a foreign country. Mainly because you can't switch translation direction when a language isn't set. 2 stars because besides the terrible UX, I depend on it for survival."

But I can't see the complete paragraph when I want to edit a word / sentence. In this app only shows one line, and it is difficult for me to edit the entire paragraph to ensure the translation is correct and has the correct grammar. If you can't make it easier to translate, it's better to use translation in the browser."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything was fine with Google Translate until this last update. It gives a million reasons as to why translation is ot possible (language not available, or text is too long, or my favorite- it simply doesn't acknowledge that there 8s any text to be translated). I'm also very upset that the new layout covers the entire screen, while the previous one gave you the option to use a partial view when translating a single word or sentence. Total degrade from the previous version."

When I translate, using my data, the screen is setup so I need to scroll down now to see the translation. Basically, everything you changed was completely unnecessary. The conversation section which I used to just keep talking and practising is now gone meaning I need to keep clicking the microphone button. It needs rolling back, for the time being, I will be using another translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They've taken away a very important function in the app with the latest update. Before, when you typed in what you wanted translated, you could turn your device sideways and the translation would be the only thing you see in much larger text. This made presenting the translation easier. This function is gone now and presenting the translation to someone is useless as it's so small and could be are to find for the person it's intended for.

It'd also be nice if they included a virtual keyboard that would let you type in multiple languages, like pinyin for Chinese."

Now I have the app on a Galaxy S10 and I have to select scan every time I want to scan text (it defaults to instant) and even more annoyingly the target language text doesn't show in the top field after scanning but the translation appears in the lower field. Also the accuracy of the scan is not as good as it used to be (target languages are Russian cyrillic and French, translating to English)"

Only can choose for it to be off or visible all the time. Why would you need it visible all the time. Preivuois version, copy the text and the the floating icon would appear, tap the icon and instantly translated. New version is more steps and overly complicated. Why fix what's not broken. please revert this app or make an old version available"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually good but offline translation randomly stopped working and cannot even be selected in the Offline Translations screen. Also, one phone has functional real-time camera translation whereas the other must first take a photo and then translate. Why the inconsistency? Is it due to the amount of memory or storage available? Please ALERT us so that we know a function won't work and why so that we can remedy the situation. I now load phrases i may need and star them. It's great that Google saves the phrases so that they can be used offline (without the voice output function which would have been helpful since many people don't understand Traditional Chinese but do understand spoken Chinese. Now I make sure to load phrases in both T&S). These are work-arounds/tips. I'd prefer offline translation was available as promised, however. Main phone: Note3 running Lollipop. Other phone which gets more offline functionality: Moto G 2nd Gen Android 6.0. I freed up 1GB of my storage (Note3) and that didn't help. Maybe this new update will help."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The translations are good if it can figure out what the original text is, but the camera input is almost useless, especially for Chinese and Japanese characters, and the handwriting interface for drawing characters like kanji is a joke. Writing a character with a dozen strokes is torturous because the system moves on to the next character after each stroke, so the process is draw stroke, hit the back button, draw the next, hit the back button, etc."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was perfect before the most recent update. You used to be able to copy something and the translate box would appear itself which was useful when talking to people where English was their main language. Now it doesn't automatically appear and the process to get it is cumbersome. Why change something that isn't broken? Update - You've added an extra layer for something that wasn' needed. Now I have to enable it each time its needed or constantly have it floating on the screen.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be great. Nothing needed to be changed. But now you've integrated the camera feature into ""lens"" since you asked for how it is, it sucks. It requires you to install a separate app rather than beeing integrated into this one. As many other people have stated it also reduces the amount of features. Nobody liked this change and nobody cares that you want everything integrated into Google lens. Just let the translate app have a translate feature. No need for separate apps."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Recent design update crippled certain use cases I used a lot before: - 'Reverse translate' action is available with 2 clicks instead of one as before. Here I mean the state when the translation is done at least once; - When translating text in another app a widget appeares and there is the 'open in app' action there which is now also available with 2 clicks instead of just one. For me the path to achieve these things became 2 times longer.

However, with the new update I have to manually reenable the feature every time I want to use it. Yes, it's in the notification panel, but it's still not as convenient as it used to be. I don't want the icon on my screen 24/7 but I want to be able to use the feature with ease. Please allow a setting for users to have it the old way if you insist on changing it. For such a robust app, the customization is lacking."

The current version automatically select what it want and won't allow me to do that. The app kept on translating only 1 letter from 3 letter (I am using it with Chinese letters) and it's on the useless side if it keep focusing on the very small part like that. Please fix this."

Soo... ya... It's pretty good. But I think google should fix the bad translates because it's getting kind of annoying. Also it has a hard time translating bubble letters! It also has a hard time translating small letters or kanji. Overall it's a pretty good app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The Afrikaans to English translation is truly pathetic. Almost every translation is incorrect and out of context. Many words in Afrikaans have two or more meanings depending on the context, and this app absolutely never gets it right. I would suggest that you get a person whose native language is proper Afrikaans to assist you. (Edit) Google LLC responded by asking me to do the translations for them. What an interesting approach. Download an app to do translations, and then do it yourself."

Very bad user interface, the conversion is not saved automatically, language translation used to be much easier, sometimes it translates to the same language. The app just went down the hill. Please bring a new update that improves the app, not the other way around."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Recent update only, now missing features like 'Tap to Translate'... reverting to previous version. Come on Google, test UI changes before inflicting them. Thanks for your reply. The updated app opens up in 'Enter text' mode, with the Menu button invisible. But once the Menu is available, the 'Tap to Translate' option can be found. Apologies for being hasty."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great app, very intuitive and would automatically translate. With the latest update the (truncated) Google Keyboard version has become horrible to use. Very disappointed in Google development.

Now it persists until I turn it off so I have to turn it back on. Also, after using tap to translate before when I clicked ""new translation"" the direction of the languages flipped so I could respond in the language I just read. But not anymore. So it's less than half as useful as before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was the best thing about Google. Now after upgrading phones it's awful. Why doesn't it just appear when I copy text, then disappear like it used to do? It worked perfectly as it was. I don't want a permanent hover button covering every screen I use. That means I have to constantly move it to read the page, but hiding it means I have to do multiple clicks to get to the translation. Please change it back!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The updates keep getting worse. The feature where they automatically open up the keyboard for the language you are translating from is beyond useless. They could have made it optional instead of default. It stays on even after I exit the app, so I've had to add a second language to my keyboard only so I can switch out of it without having to go to settings every time. And it messes up the handwriting space. And you no longer see an index of synonyms for Traditional Chinese. Altogether abysmal."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is a lifesaver when I simply run out of words. My Spanish is passable as long as I am not trying to get complicated thoughts across, but when it gets too deep, out comes the Translate. It doesnt always catch the exact meaning, but I think that has to do with using idioms and slang. Wait time on the conversation function is too short as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Except for huge step backwards in the tap-to-translate functionality, this is a good program. I wish Google would return to the previous pop-up-only-when-needed functionality. Don't refer me to a forum post to try to convince me the new version is an improvement or a feature. It's a critical bug and it needs to be fixed ASAP. You had a great thing going and you messed it up. Please make it great again."

English-Spanish translations were fast and effortless with text and voice modes, though the character recognition feature was a little clumsy. It was a true workhorse we used multiple times everyday. The last week of May 2022, a new version was installed that brought the app to a dead standstill. Now all I get is error messages. As a retired IT professional I wonder about the test process."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Several people have described this issue. The pop up settings have changed dramatically causing the functionality of the app to suffer. The pop up used to come up every time the text was copied. Making it incredibly simple to translate. Now when you want the pop up you have to swipe down and enable the floating pop-up. Nobody wants the pop up to be there forever!! It's supposed to disappear after a few seconds. Upsetting as now it is too much effort to use.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It'd be great if the app can access what's on the screen, because some sites doesn't allow copying + if you've got no other device to translate using camera, thus no translation possible.

Every time I have to manually copy the text, switch the language, and paste it back in. I frequently switch the language when using the translator, to check the translation given by running it through the other way, so that I can exchange ambiguous words and get the correct meaning. Why does it not work as it does in the browser?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Latest update made this app from useful to unreliable. While being in China, now it only works through VPN which it didn't before the update. And translation process now is slower and less agile switching between languages. Now I'm uncertain using this app as quick conversations where speaker won't repeat him/herself might be lost just because app doesn't respond. Very unfortunate as the earlier version didn't have such issues."

You can go back the old UI, or keep the new one admit you don't care about the users. So, when are you going to revert to the old interface?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app by Google. I really liked it but it should have options for changing male/female voices for each languages in the app itself, both for online as well as offline. Also there should be option for changing the accent of the English language and it should show the complete translated lines. Please add these features in Google translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was told to get a new version of the app, before it can use the lens. I can't find out the update button on here. Please, do something about it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For Japanese, it's very unreliable for vertical OCR. When using the camera feature the app strongly tends towards reading a vertical paragraph horizontally. It REALLY needs a ""read vertically only"" option to be useful for Asian languages. Having the app decide which way to read is useless as it gets it wrong 75 percent of the time. It's great when reading correctly, just rare that it does. Works fine for horizontal OCR."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app keeps getting worse. First the floating icon became permanently stuck on screen, rather than smartly popup after a copy. Now with another update, it doesn't automatically paste and translate what was copied when the floating icon is pressed and has to manually be entered. To Dev: I am aware that the icon can be removed/hidden. But in the original iteration of this app, the icon used to be more practical and convenient. It didn't appear on screen (so was unintrusive) except when it was needed, when a copy of text was made. Then it appeared briefly and the user could tap it to translate what they copied automatically."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I regret updating to new version. The app was really good as it was, but not anymore. I am a frequent user of Google Translate. But after updating, it is total frustration for me. It is slower, and I don't see the buttons and when I highlight/copy the language I want to translate, I don't get translate's icon automatically appearing. I don't want the icon always displayed on screen. I wish I knew how to undo the latest updates. Please return it to how it was, otherwise I have to uninstall it."

Sometimes it doesn't get all of it translated. It works better with little phrases. I use it to test my Korean, and these are some of the problems I have. The camera is not perfect, but vaguely good. 잘해서! Edit; 20 sept. And it needs a dark theme!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. It is still useful but I, like many others, are not pleased with the new update and new looking interface. The steps it takes just to get a quick translation is unnecessary. Also my floating icon frequently disappears... It never stays on my screen. I have to keep going into the app and reselecting it to appear. Overall I love this app because I need this app and because it's the most universal app for translation service. Please improve. Thank you in advance."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please go back to the previous version that was. This latest UI is really really bad and not user friendly at all. Tap to translate absolutely sucks now. Does not automatically take copied text and paste it in the field. Does not select preset language to translate so I'm stuck translating English to English until I open up the full app. Absolutely terrible. Go back to older version please. Newer is not always better.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When Google does something good and it works perfectly, it doesn't get praised for it. So here's just a quick review for the thousands of times this app saved me, especially the offline feature, works like a charm when you're in a foreign country, no internet. No more getting lost in translation. Best translation app by far, keep it up google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new Interface is not intuitive at all. All the useful buttons are badly organised which makes it a nightmare if you need to constantly translate while reading for example and you need to change language often. The keyboard interrupts the screen with its appearance. When you paste a text the translation doesn't come first but you need to slide down.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow, google, who needed a promotion and came with an idea to mess up a perfectly working app? Ever since the update, the translations are bad, you can not take a normal picture and select the text (it just blurs with the rest of the surrounding text) and you can't do offline translations anymore. The worst thing is when you go back and uninstall the update, after some short time of normal work it goes back to ""in order to use camera feature, you need to update to the newest version)..."

If you could make it seven (7) that would do just perfectly. And sometimes there are confusion in the app when a word can be a noun or verb. (ie) strip (noun-of wood or land) or strip(verb-take away) If there was a function to let the app know what it is dealing with, that would be just swell! Furthermore no other serious complaints- overall very satisfied, thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A huge tech company is doing a lousey job translating sentences from English to Chinese and vice versa. Half the time it is completely wrong because it actually gives the opposite meaning. The other half of the time is anywhere between half right to correct. It is also extremely limited in defining single words because it does not include meanings for the word used in a different context.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't work on my device despite the fact that it says it's compatible. Was working fine until a few weeks ago, now it shows a permanent ""No network"" error whenever I try to translate anything from the camera (or even if I bypass the camera and try to upload a stored picture). It's not my network as it works fine for every other app, and won't even let me bypass the Network with the offline packs either, it just refuses to work, period."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be fantastic. The new update is horrific. Makes it look like a plastic copy of Microsoft Translate. Don't fix what ain't broke. It's clunky with continuous errors regarding downloading language packs and is poorly laid out without the useful information it used to contain after the translation. It's gone from being my goto translation app to now looking for an alternative.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a really great app, easy to use and quick to translate. You could even change languages without having to re-type your phrase. Now it is confusing and difficult to use. Far too many button presses, extra menus & windows which are just totally unnecessary! Please revert this app back to the way it was before the update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was perfect before they updated it. Now what used to be once simple tap to translate, is now so damn complicated and also completely unnecessary. Why fix something that isnt broken. And also the tap for translate now stays on your screen instead of only appearing when you want to translate. Honestly so horrible. Going to download a different app or find an older version api."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Going to uninstall due to the redesign. Its a good app, but I prefer how it used to be. Loss of functionality without the option to switch back to a legacy version. Google might think they have the monopoly on apps but they don't, and I don't care if the translation isn't as good, I'll just use something else as it isn't the old translate now anyway!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Worked perfectly fine for me before the last update with ""improved offline translation quality"". It won't work for me offline for now. My lists of downloaded vocabularies and available for download ones are empty. I would be glad to get some response from anyone to resolve this problem to give the proper rating for the app (it proved to be very useful for me). edit #1: I'd tried the proposed steps, but nothing really has changed for me. edit #2: reinstalled the app - now it works fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been very unhappy with the new floating icon. I much preferred the pop up design when messages were copied. I was so excited yesterday when mine reverted back to the original on its own, but today is back to the new again. I'm also still having trouble with updates on languages. It freezes up & won't download no matter what. You have to uninstall the app & reinstall. This is a situation where leaving something alone was better than messing with it. Better options would be nice to add."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor speech recognition and getting worse!! Again, I use this app to communicate with my wife on a daily basis. She speaks exclusively Mandarin. It seems that the performance of this app has deteriorated instead of getting better with updates. The app does not recognize simple words in the context they are meant. For example names. I said my brothers name (Jim)but the app translated it as the word (gym) in the sentence. There are other speech recognition issues as well that need fixing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please fix it as soon as possible! Especially the Taptotranslate feature, the floating thing was the best thing for this app before the update as it only appeared once you copied something you want to translate and with one touch you can view the translation and be done. NOW it is very annoying that it stays on screen all the time and takes many taps to just view the translation. I know that you are trying to advance the app, fix bugs, and add new features for all users. BUT do not compromise."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The conversation mode doesn't translate continuously. It records sounds until it detects a pause, then it speaks the translation, and stops recording. you have to hit record AGAIN to start it up again, but by that time you've missed like 5 seconds of conversation. Horrible for translating a conversation between 2 people. Maybe if you are interviewing someone where there's predictable pause between question and answer, but for an actual conversation, this just doesn't work. It should continually record AND play back the translation as it keeps recording."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, I used translate a lot because I'm learning Spanish. All of a sudden, it's not translating anything. It stopped first on my old phone (Note 9) and I figured it may have been a setting that I may have changed. When I got my new phone (Note 10+) I tried again before restoring any old settings and it still is not working. I can use it fine on the web, but something in the app is bugging out. I'll update my rating if this issue is resolved. But as of now, I'm stuck with the web version."

I was a little disappointed from the last version that the old history used to come first, then the new one came later after through the long scrolling.

I used to be able to copy text and hit the floating icon and have it Auto translated. Now I have to clear the previous translation and then make an extra click to translate the new one, and do that each time. It's extremely annoying to have to clear out old translations before getting new ones when I have copied the text and it doesn't automatically translate it. Please go back to the old version that didn't suck."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new appearance very much, the old version is good enough, why on earth did you make this terrible change? And there is a horrible bug!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the translation app updated you can never get rid of the popup shortcut. Before the update, it would only overlay on the screen when you were actually using it for translations. After you clicked out of it, the shortcut would automatically hide. I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times hoping it would correct the bugs in the overlay settings. You are forced to disable the overlay so it's not interfering with every screen on your phone when it's not in use!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hate the change previous version before update was better. Being able to use the camera to translate signs. The best was the transcribe I could watch a movie in Spanish and it would text what they where saying. That option is no longer there. Doesn't pick up conversation unless very close. It doesn't flow like it did before the horrible update. Leave things alone when good or give the option to keep the old look
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many issues. Among them - broken, unorganized and thus, non-functional phrasebook. Saved words and phrases are not separated by languages, not to mention the ""sort by time"" option just doesn't work - the list is not chronological, new saved words don't appear in the beginning. The app keeps getting updates now and then - why not fix this little bug? Shameful for this company and this beautiful service."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't update! New update is trash You used to be able to take pictures and then select the text you want to highlight piece by piece. Incredibly useful to read labels in supermarkets or restaurant menus. Some genius decided to completely get rid of that and just leave us with the godawful ""instant translate"" camera view. This mode is garbage and flips between two or three different nonsense translations in a view that is just about unreadable. Who the hell decided this was a good idea"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The new interface took some time to get used to but I'm quite satisfied with the new look. What bugs me is that many languages have this abrupt stop at the end of record, sometimes it ends even before the ending of the word. For example, when I was trying to hear the proper spelling of a Norwegian word but couldn't make out the last part due to the abrupt stop. For now the only way to here the entire sentence is to add another word at the end of it so the recording won't stop so abruptly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app used to work great. They recently changed the image translation feature to use Google lens. Now most of the time when trying to translate Japanese or other Asian languages it works poorly. Much of the time it will skip entire portions of text and only translate a few words when there's obviously more text. They also removed the ability to select specific portions to translate. Overall a huge downgrade and not worth using anymore.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app way too funny. Once you translate a sentence from English to any other language, and from that to yet another, and again to other one, and translate it back to English after doing it several times, the output is ridiculous. The meaning of input is totally destroyed. This app is a great source of entertainment for me. Despite the flaws, I think this is really cool. For such funny videos based on translation, subscribe the channel ""Translation Fails"" on YouTube."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The older version was much easier to use and better. You could copy a text and it would automatically translate the text into the language you use. When you wanted to use another language you could text and it would automatically translate the text. Now you have to copy text, search for language, select language because detecting translation doesn't work and then finally it would translate. Older version was much more fluid and easier to use. Current version has too many steps to translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Beside disputable changes in UI, it doesn't work any more for me. Sony Xperia XZ1 here. For example in WhatsApp when I copy a text, the usual balloon doesn't appear any more. Via the contextual menu after a long press I can choose ""translate"" for it to appear but then I have to manually paste the text and press to translate. If I choose to show the floating icon in the settings, this is permanent and intrusive, and I have to still paste the text I manually copied in to get my translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not fond of the way the updated Translate works. With a previous version of Translate when I activated the Tap to Translate function, I could copy or highlight text and the Translate icon would appear. The icon only appeared when I needed it. Now, the icon hovers over everything, all the time, until I de-activate it. For me, this is quite annoying. Please consider modifying the Tap to Translate function on future updates. I depend on Google Translate a lot. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update was a terrible idea. Tap to translate can only be used if the icon stays on the screen indefinitely. Not like prior to the update where the icon only popped up after copying a text, which was WAY better. And the actual current display is terrible compared to the previous version.

Google, if it's not broke, don't fix it! August 2nd update a big fail! App uninstalled and previous version installed."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, now you can't have it activated without the annoying bubble in the screen or having to go into the top menu to find the app every time you need a translation Also crashes a lot in the last few months and app menu is no longer accessible without doing a translation first Also its harder to find the history of searches now Was an awesome product, but somehow managed to lose the practical and essential features. Very disappointing since it was so extremely useful"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think this one of the best app to use when in a foreign country or any language which u can't speak my favourite thing about this was that it can easily convert text from other languages to the language u understand
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think it should have been a secret place to hide your translate.But it doesn't have no place to hide your transition but it is okay and I also think that there should be some games on it like Toca world where you don't have to download it on Play store but on Google translate I think I shall raped in this a (five ) you need to listen to me what I'm saying you really need to improve this google translate so everybody who is reading this it is okay there are some translate you can't get it good
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the redesign it became much less useful and more difficult to use. I used Google translate for Chinese English translation and previously could easily copy the pinyin transcription, now the app only allows to copy the Chinese characters or English output. Also it takes longer to access past translations. So with the new design it basically takes longer to access all functionality as they moved to sub menus and also some functionality has been removed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Off-line translation does not work anymore. Yesterday all translation files I downloaded before suddenly disappeared. Now when I try to download an Off-line language nothing happens. The latest update I installed today didn't help. Also since February the interface became horrible. The fonts are too large. So, a lot of screen space is wasted. When I type with screen keyboard the immediate translation is hidden and it is very inconvenient. I wrote in the in-app help system but got no response."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Years of using Google Translate on the several languages I work with and never had a problem with it, It was almost perfect, within the limitations of automatic translators: instead of having a dictionary for each pair of languages I only had this app and searched for the word, or typed sentence by sentence to find a rudimentary equivalent in this or that other language. But lately I've had several issues with the algorithm, I don't know what you people did but you ruined it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is Nice App which help me on daily basis, though I suggest, along with Synonyms, can antonyms possible for wordsz which additionally help."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have to agree with the sudden surge of 1-star reviewers: this new update has ruined what was once the best translator on the app store. Google attempted to further minimalize what was already a highly minimalist app. All functions of the app are now harder to find, and frustratingly take more taps and gestures to do. They removed the reverse translate button, as well as the ability to full screen only your translated result. I'm baffled as to how this current version was approved for release."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good but very much annoyed with the facility of camera. Whenever I click a photo and translate it, it always gives me wrong translation. I have tried many times to translate but always got a wrong translation. Please look. You say I should click on 'Suggest an Edit' option and submit the right translation but it scans everything wrong. Sometimes text is big so I cannot write it so I click photo and it scans wrongly. Then what is the use of camera . Very much annoyed. Please look."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"These reviews are pretty accurate. I may as well use a physical dictionary. Before, one could just outline text and directly use tap-to-translate(TTT). Then it changed to having to copy it first, and then TTT. Now you have to copy, TTT, paste, select output language and push translate. I can't use this app anymore if this isn't fixed quickly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Previously one of my favorite translation apps now ruined by the new update. No translation history, UI may look sleek but when actually put into use is too cramped, and I'm now unable to use the handwritten translation feature as the ""canvas"" for it is now ⅓ the size it was before. I can't even uninstall the new update either, so I'm stuck with this version. Please provide the option to go back to the last version of the app, since, despite some saying they enjoy the update, many of us hate it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a must have app. Since last 2 years or so, it is degrading rapidly. Now at the edge of usability. Seriously, who hides the reverse translate button under the submenu button. Fire the guy who decided this. And come back to the old principles that simply work and are tested. Also, the offline translations are working 50% of the time. Not a must have reliable app anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate seems to have been ruined with the Android 10 update. Basically the bubble is permanently visible or your have to disable this function. It worked perfectly fine, I'm not sure why it had to change and if you're anyone who lives in a foreign country you know how useful and helpful that was. I'm surprised that hasn't been fixed but really hope it is soon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated 9/2022 The new interface is all but unuseable for Japanese at least. Gone are the days of getting to easily slide your finger across characters for simple translation. Now it's all double taps and terrible formatting. Additionally, why does Google now require access to my camera and gallery to translate? It used to provide better translations WITHOUT access to my personal things. A worse translation with more privacy invasion? WHO WANTS THAT??? It was good while it lasted, but no more..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi! Google Translate was one of my first applications that I started to use, and for all the years that I've been using it I had never have any problem. It's very accurate and give you different alternatives in ways that nouns, verb, adverb (etcetera) you can work with it plus the pronunciation is really good. For this reasons and many others, I rate this application with five (5) stars, ""So far so good """
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: voice translate still getting worse with every update. Almost never translates properly any more.. So I leave a 2* review, Google replies and deletes my review? That seems unfair. Voice translate doesn't work very well any more. The floating translation thing is a nice idea but only appears if you copy some text. It doesn't appear with the long press context menu which would be much better. Turned it off as it was annoying appearing every time I ever highlighted and copied something."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't think you guys were understanding me correctly. On my old phone I could leave tap to translate on at all times. As soon as I'd copy something the icon would pop up, I'd click & read, exit out, and it'd pop right back up the next time no problem. But now, if I have it on, the icon stays on the screen constant. If I swipe it off, it turns off. So I'm constantly having to go back & forth turning it off & on. I don't like that, & i don't understand why the app updated to be inconvenient?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disappointed, that's really all I can say. The character limit on the app is much lowere than the Google translate website so its a waste of time to try and translate large sections. I would have been happy to use it as the translation appears to be quality, but if I have to break up things into four sections its simply a waste of my time when I can use the website or another translation app that doesn't have that problem. And Google's response is missing the point. Text limit doesn't work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usability could be greatly improved, if it was integrated with Google's own assistant. None of the following (or similar) phrases work with google translate: ""Hey google, translate the text on the screen"", ""... take a screenshot and translate it"" or even "".. take a screenshot and then open it in google translate"". Instead, If we have an image on screen with foreign text, we have to screenshot or save it, then go to google translate app, navigate through the menus, search for the file, manually select the text... you get the point. The app works great if you can select the on-screen text, but if you cannot - you'll have to spend a minute or so."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app was good as it was. Annoyed that the history doesn't display underneath anymore. Not happy with that. Although I suppose the fact that you can draw a word helps. I typed, 'The only reason I need bottled water is because my tap water is polluted.' I already know some of the Japanese, but translate can help with the rest and is often still a good tool to figure out more. Although studying the construction of the language, and using a proper dictionary, is more authentic."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version is terrible please fix it. It says that the volume is off when it isn't. I've cleared data and cache, forced stop. Nothing works. It means I can't play sound at all. Also the voice recognition is terrible now and the new layout is bad, especially as it's harder to change between languages (have to go back a page)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app to have around and i would recommed alaways have this on your phone. The only reason I give this app a 4 star rather than 5 is simply because there seems to be an extreme bias. The bias seems to be that the app struggles extremely to translate some smaller languages such as Irish and Lithuanian, while at the same time I can get almost perfect translations on Spanish, French and English. Would love to see this app improve upon that, especially Irish."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really think this is a good idea to be able to learn a language the way you want getting to choose the words you want to say and then learn how to pronounce them. But the minute you try to use words in a sentence, and this part is amusing, it makes up a bunch of phrases that make no sense like when I was trying to say something in French through the microphone to translate it into English. One example was: ""My mother touched my"". It detects words wrong once said close together. Confusing app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In the past was very impressed with the app once I realized contractions and slang were the difficulty. I really liked the icon appearing when I copied something, then disappearing after a few seconds. The latest update either has the icon on top of the screen all of the time, or if disabled, you must leave the app to translate. Since I am involved in discussions with people from several countries 15-20 times a day it's now more of a hindrance than a help"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If it not broken dont fix it! I used this app on a daily basis but I've now found myself having to looking elsewhere. The quick translation pop up feature was perfect before, copy to translate and the pop up shows for a few seconds then disappears, where as the new update leaves it on the screen infinitely. The voice translation isnt as accurate as before and the interface is just horrible. Please revert back to the way it was before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very unintuitive, lots of frustrations. So many obvious improvements, so many obvious flaws. Clearly the developers don't use the app, or else they themselves would know its shortcomings and fix them. Simple things, like taking a picture but forgetting to switch what order the translation is in, having to back out and switch it and takr another picture. This could be automated, as this is an app by Google I don't see how it couldn't be, in the very least be able to flip post photo, with a button"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The text, the camera, the conversation translations work fine for me. But my problem is that once I paste a link to be translated and it's done, the ""paste"" icon is stuck there and I have no clue on how to delete it! This problem has been reported several times to you guys by a lot of users but you still haven't added the delete option for the pesky paste icon. I keep updating this app and nothing has been done yet. When are you going to address this issue?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just love this app but it needs some serious and immediate improvements. First, the offline download for translation of some language should also contain audio. Obviously, you are in many cases be required to know how something is pronounced or sounds like. This audio download can be kept optional if you guys are worried about our storage. Second, there's a glitch (maybe it's intentional). When you copy some text the translate icon appears normally but doing it a second time will open the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"awful decision in recent update to make the ""tap-to-translate"" floating icon permanent...the functionality previously was perfect, appearing as an option once text was copied to the clipboard what is the justification? EDIT: ""tap-to-translate"" access method changed, runs like a charm as always...appreciate the prompt response from the dev team!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've relied on this for years to help with language learning but two things have always bugged me about the camera mode: by default the original text is covered up by the translation (why can't we set our own default?) and it's quite difficult to select text that's bigger than a word but smaller than the whole page - and the latter is even harder now that Translate outsources the camera to Lens, where half the screen is covered with buttons and pop-up dialogs."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Compared to an older version which I have on an older phone, this version is nearly rubbish. Click to translate no longer works, seems like translating more than five characters causes the whole matrix of time and space to collapse. I'm probably exaggerating a bit but it's not far from the truth. Constantly asks me to select a backup account for 'storage', even though I can't star translations greater than three words. Instant translation is generally useless; and many gripes, but I'm out of spa"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update it doesn't work anymore offline. We need to search 2 time to make it work (i guess it take time to launch one my cheap phone cpu, it doesn't work the first time. But only the second one). I and my friend who has the same problem, send several feedback since weeks, to signal the bug but nobody cares. Please let us come back to the previous update!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best app to translate unkown words. Although some words don't have meaning you could go to the google app and typ the word and search. The thing is the new update is a bit bad. When you use the camera you won't be able to switch the language to the other language, you have to go back home or keep on pressing the buttons to change the language which makes it a bit inconvenient."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The voice input works only occasionally when you're lucky, if it's working it recognizes only half of what I'm saying in my native tongue. App design is, as with most other Google apps, a careless, rigid, rudimentary assemblage of features. I'm surprised that Google with all its might cannot come up with one single well designed app across the whole range of its Android apps. I mean all of them (except maybe Arts&Culture)... Store app just crashed when I was finishing this review. Mediocre"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I already sent a message to the developer about the issues with Google Translate and the App is getting worse. When translating to Japanese, the App over rides the pronunciation of it's own translation, giving a wrong Onyomi. The text doesn't fit in the upper corner of the screen so the first letter is void. When manually typing Japanese, the character search happens to fast, by then not allowing me to finish the writing of the whole character. Difficult to use in that sense."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app, but there are no phonetice transcriptions for english language, so i suggest adding a phonetice transcription in the later versions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"so far, this is a wonderful app! this is more helpful when am outside my city. I have one suggestion, can you integrate this translator with local and online videos. if that happens we can easily understand the unknown languages in the videos. that is really helpful. you have already find the solution for detecting the language in a voice clip. it will replace all subtitle file downloading pain and synchronization mismatches. it will surely help to all users."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is excellent and I love to rate it with 5 stars.The only thing I don't like is that all controls are located at top. It's extremely inconvenient to stretch my fingers to the top every time I use this app. It would be really nice if I had some toggle in settings to move all the top part of the app to bottom - text box and languages. My fingers hang my phone at its bottom part! Not the top!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you set English language region to US, it speaks US accent a little bit and then change to UK in magic! although nothing is changed in the settings. And you cannot return it back until you clear the cache and set to US again (will work a little bit and revert again)!!! IT'S NOT A SPEECH RECOGNITION PROBLEM!!! The same problem is described in the reviews by somebody else and one of the dummy support guys reply that speech recognition isn't perfect!!!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, Google Translate, great work uniting the world with language. There's an itsy bitsy problem with the translations themselves, firstly, some things are just not to be rendered into transliteration, it ruins the meaning. Would be nice if you could include popular idioms/expressions that would be confusing if translated literally. Also, I think the Igbo and Yoruba languages are popular enough to have audio. Please include thag for better understanding. Other than that, great app. Thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app. for a couple of years already and it has really helped me to translate texts very smoothly, rapidly and quite accurately from English to Chinese, Japanese, Spanish & Portuguese which the latter two I do speak & write very fluently! I had in fact introduced this app to quite a few friends years ago. I didn't have time to write a review because I had been flying around all of Eastern n Western Europe as well and didn't have enough time to do this! This is a great app & thanks!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it! The translates team is doing an all around fantastic job. I use it to translate between English and Spanish, french, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Russian. Text, voice, and video work great. For video it's nice to see the realtime overlay and to be able to pause scenes. I love to be able to see pinyin/romanji in Chinese/Japanese translations. I hope Cantonese can be integrated soon! At that time so will give 5 stars."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I thank your team and I think your application is the best translator, but in terms of UI, it is not very well done.In terms of translation quality, I think it is the best, but the features of a similar model, i.e. index, are better and it is more fun to work with it. I have given you feedback several times in the application, but no confirmation or change has been made.One of the most important things you need to do is that we can share photos from the gallery and anywhere else for translation,"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be great until the bubble became persistent. Please put it back to original functionality which only showed the bubble when copying text. The bubble is extremely annoying and prevents proper use of the phone when not needing to translate. Another option would be an easier on/off switch for the bubble. You posted a link on previous feedback giving a reason why you'd ruined a great app. The link didn't work. Why not just solve the problem?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For this app to be useful while traveling, it needs to function without internet. So it has you download specific languages for that, alright. The text based translate works just fine, but the photo based one does not. It asks you to download a language to use this feature offline no matter what. Suppose it's just a separate download from the settings menu, nope. Even if you clear your downloads and try downloading it from the photo prompt, nothing happens, nothing downloads, doesn't work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I should actually rate this app with 5 stars if just the text box would be designed better!? The text field should actually pop-up allowing the user to easily edit, read the entire text. But it is a ""pain"" if you have a long text to edit, read or rewrite, since the window shows just few sentences!!! If that is resolved I am a 5 star fan of this fantastic app. Thank you, Google 🙏🏻"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate this new update. I use it all the time every day for spanish. It has lost its usability on my phone, android. I can't switch easily backwards and forwards between english and spanish like i used to be able to. :-( Edit. Now lens has been added which i can't get rid of. The visibility of the translated text is appalling. It appears faint and fuzzy now, and not a lot of uncluttered área to read the translation. Grr!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Seriously, this history thing is really pissing me off. At least give me a button on the main screen to quickly access history. Don't make me go up into a layered hidden option. Not even all of my history is saving. It's more sporadic, if it's in the mood to save. It was better before the update. Thanks for screwing up a perfectly good app, Google. Good job."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is excellent an application to use it and helping me when I need it. but I have issue with it. After finishing downloaded the languages which are I need to them via an application offline, While came back during open the application, Suddenly, I didn't found all the languages which I have been downloaded before, and it gave me error message ""You aren't on line"".

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Because of the offline translation and the speech to text (and vice versa) functions, this app is a total game changer!! Just remember to download the languages you need, for example if you're travelling... And I have to note, Google Translate has been advanced TREMENDOUSLY in the last 10 years. The translator often does a good job accurately translating culture-specific expressions, figures of speech, specific slang words, ""spoken"" words such as ""wanna"" instead of ""want to"". Fantastic service!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just used this app for the first time. I am over the moon thrilled with what I was just able to accomplish. I work as a healthcare provider with minimal translation resources. Today I had a patient with translation needs. Granted I haven't used this service in a few years, but I was astonished to see the conversation mechanic. Using this feature was easier than using a third personal to translate,in my opinion. The picture function is sweet too!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The functionality of this app was 10/5. But Google has consistently made their products worse over time. Using Translate is now harder and less useful because they decided it looks nicer to remove or hide access to basic operations. What used to be fast and easy is now finicky and difficult. This seems to be a consistent theme with Google whereby form wins out over function.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pop up translation used to work perfectly, but now works only when it wants to. The 3 star rating is only for this. As far as translation goes...use the supplied translations with caution. It is impossible for any translation application to translate 100% from one language into another. Like all apps, Google ignores context, and more often than not the translations are simply a word for word process. I use it mainly as a dictionary, but even for that I would give it 4 stars at most."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app a lot in Japan. I would really like the ability to change the translation direction after I've taken a camera picture. Too often have I been translating from English to Japanese, and then need to translate in the reverse direction. I take a photo, but I did not change the translation direction beforehand. Now I must exit the image translate, losing my picture, and switch the direction on the previous screen, then take the picture again. Please let me switch in retrospect"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great app that's helped me communicate with my b&b host in italy. Although most of the time you have to speak precisely, as speaking too quickly doesn't get picked up too well, it has still been invaluable. I would highly recommend for holidaying. It could even come in handy if say a visitor to your country was asking for directions for example. Hopefully the more downloads it gets the better it will get."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is the floating icon permanently on the screen now?? Or permanently off, if disabled?? The previous version worked brilliantly, with the icon appearing when text was copied but now it is a real annoyance to have on the screen all the time. Especially since it's response area is actually bigger than the icon, so it keeps getting activated by accident. & a permanent notification?? Another unnecessary annoyance. Go back to the old method, it worked much better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Regular translations work well but image translations have become useless for me. Foreign characters (Asian, cyrillic, etc) get misinterpreted unless it's perfect typeface, and no (easily accessible) way to select individual text to help keep context clear. Similarly, used to be able to use audio but I don't think it accepts weird accents that easily. But the main translator is good if you can copy/paste."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The usefulness of this app is GONE!!! Tje most recent update has destroyed the ability to rapidly translate a text conversation. Instead of detecting the language and translating to my default. I have to select the language EACH TIME!! VERY UNPRODUCTIVE. I also no longer see the ability to quickly translate text within an image. You took a solid useful app and made it junk...why? Because some useless teenager in research said ""Hey, this looks cool"""
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The user interface is downgraded with every update. The former interface was best but this one sucks a lot. After the new update, even with a good internet connection it stuck on the searching of word and then I have to close and restart the app. History section has also become terrible. It shows history after a delay. What a plight it has become"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for big text, bad for individual words. For big amount of Text it's a very good app to get most of the work done in a short time. However translating single words it's not good in putting it into context. An app like Reverso is very good to translate single words. The two apps combined make up for a good combo. Thank you👍"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The software is a great app to use, I usually use it to translate a lot. But I gave it 3 star because their was no need for any update and if their was to be an update their should be a way to link the Google translator to the Gboard or any keyboard software,but especially the Gboard so that typing and translating could be a little bit faster and easier. If their was a link to the Gboard, their will be no need to copy the text that brings out the translator icon in the screen. Link to Gboard!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google fixes app by making it worse. Previously the 'Tap to Translate' button only appeared after one copied some text. Now it is a persistent bubble on the right side of the screen. Hiding the bubble completely turns off the feature. It's not like I'm translating stuff all the time so the bubble shouldn't be visible all the time. I'll give a 5 star review once Google fixes this feature to work the way it had previously.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is MUCH better than the Microsoft translation tool built into Office 365, but I still miss the old GT that could translate 5,000-word documents in seconds with about 75 to 90% accuracy. Another problem I ran into recently is that the online GT tool is stuck on a weird language - Uzbek of all things (no offense, I'm only saying ""weird"" because I don't know this language, have never worked with it or translated anything from it). I've tried flushing the cache in Chrome several times, and GT still opens with Uzbek as the default source language. And I'm stubbornly refusing to switch to Edge, mostly because I resent the pushy in-your-face promotion tactics."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Low quality translations. Not much better than what we got in the early 2000s (when there seemed to exist a certain bin who was laden with the name of osama🙄)
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Google translate layout of the new version is very bad, it shows less info on the same screen, no recent looked up on the same screen when looking up new translation, unable to invert the translation language back and forth on the fly. Newly looked up doesn't show up in the history once in a while. How can I roll back to the previous version?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Updated review: Not sure how it happened but it is now detecting headset mode/ speaker properly. Thank you developers if you had this fixed. App works well, have used it for a long time for work. I am having a more recent problem with the conversation option. It assumes my headset it plugged in and asks for a push to talk function. Please fix this as it is unusable for me now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Downgrade the rate from 5 to 3. There's so much differences in the latest version compare to the old one. I like better the old UI instead of this one. Also it fails few times to translate with notification telling that ""can't translate, check your connection and try again"", even though I have no connection problem, I can connect other app flawlessly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new layout is rediculous. We used to have one screen with a few simple buttons, now it keeps changing layouts and making you start over if you need to swap languages, and the pinyin doesn't generate half of the time for chinese. Stop letting your UX designers fly off the handle to be impressive. Go back to the easy, functional app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I use Translate's functions a lot from the text writing to camera tools, the new update has really impeded my use of the app. Not only is the camera function not as user friendly, the app now takes control over my (broken) wide angle lens phone camera, instead of the normal phone camera. Before the update, this was not an issue. So far, I haven't found any setting to change the camera settings. Otherwise, the app is decent for writing and typing, giving correct translations mostly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mostly use it to translate Japanese to English. Sometimes sketchy, probably for the most part due to problems inherent in the structure of Japanese (e.g. sentences in Japanese without explicit subject translated to English with, in the past, ""I"" put in as subject of the English translation, and lately not ""I"" but ""it"". Overall, it's a real life saver, though."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update on image translating is making me crazy! Before, you could select the text you wanted to translate and that was very helpful, but this update where it automatically translates the entire picture is horrible. Terrible. It sucks. I've been using it for a while and it's the most infuriating experience on this app compared to how it was back then. Bring back text selection on picture translation is all I have to say. Sometimes less is better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was an amazing app, especially the floating icon feature which allowed you to just copy any text on any other app and the floating icon would appear and help translate but with the new update the floating icon suddenly has to stay all the time on the screen which is annoying and not practical at all... and now you have to actually paste the text when before it would appear automatically when you copied it... really really disappointed... I hope everything can be as before the update tbh..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: not only is the ""new"" (now 1 y.o.) interface strictly worse, but now it doesn't even work! I'm on Xiaomi Redmi note 11 and it buffers forever without finding a translation. I tried reinstalling it, still won't fix the bug. Description: after inputting the wor, the translator shows a grey blank, as it would when it is loading the answer. It gets stuck there. Occasionally, when moving to a different app and coming back, the translation is displayed, like it has always been there."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Idk what you did, but undo it ASAP. The app was fine and now out of the blue I get some crappy translations that are completely unreliable and waste my time, while reverse translation for the same words seems to bring back the expected results. Especially tap to translate is having the most problems. Also admit that you DON'T KNOW EVERY F****ING LANGUAGE AND ARE INADEQUATE TO BE ABSOLUTE and add an option to improve translations by submitting the right ones."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"used it when I was in Mexico for English to Spanish and it was very helpful but then couldn't find any way to turn off the tap to translate feature besides uninstall an app. I don't need tap to translate running in the background all the time when I'm home. Since what you sent me isn't a link I can click on nor can I copy and past, it isn't helpful at all. Besides, it shouldn't be so hard to turn off. Here's a hint, it should be easy to find in the settings tab."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It would have been very good if the meaning of the word as well as the definition was translated.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Before updating the app, the tap to translate button would appear on the screen automatically whenever I copied any text, and it would disappear after closing the translation. It was very intuitive. But after updating the app, the tap to translate button always remains on the screen. Which is very annoying and non-intuitive. Please revert back to the previous way of showing tap to translate."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"First it is the best translator that I have found so far, but it has quirks. When I am at home with a very strong 175 Mbps Wi-Fi connection Google Translate acts as if I have no internet connection. Speech translation does not work. When I turn the Wi-Fi off and switch to the mobile network speech translation starts to work. My girlfriend is from Cuba and a translator is a necessity in my life, so that is extremely aggravating. Also often times the translation makes absolutely no sense at all"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WHAT HAPPENED?!? I loved this app before and it's my lifeline moving to another country where I don't know the language. I can't use it offline now (WHY??). I can't even use the floating icon because it's CONSTANTLY in the way! The instant camera translator is laggy and gets stuck if I move it between texts, where before it felt smooth like an AI filter. I have to go to a different menu to switch to reverse translation. And it looks clunky, outdated, and ugly now like a cheaply made kids app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The previous version was better , in had some special factors like photo translation and wa can copy the text and the offline factor"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible after the update 3 days ago. And linking to my Google account and asking loads of permissions before continuing to work. It's invasive and unnecessary. There's no reverse button on the photo translate anymore, so if you're switching back and forth it's slow and clumsy. Too much added wordiness and explanation. The interface is more cluttered now. I'll be finding another app ASAP."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good, but like most ggogle apps fails miserably offline. You can download language packs which google claims will allow full functionality offlien, but when your out of reach of a mobile signal, and tap the microphone it says no available offline. I had already downloaded the relevant packs, but it is of no use. It appears this used to work, but google must have made a conscious choice to disable it. Maybe because they can't record what your saying offline and use it later they aren't interested"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This Is by far the best free app i have found. I used it to translate English to Italian. It's free, there are no annoying ads that pop up a million times, and it actually pronounces the words correctly when translating with voice. All others either had a million ads, the voice was very computerized and pronounced the words how they looked rather than how it was actually pronounced in the language, and you had to pay to use it or get rid of ads, or any combination of those issues."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A feature I used a lot, which showed the text at the largest possible size when on landscape mode (the white on blue text) for easy and accessible readibility, is now gone. It was quite helpful when showing translated text to others in a rush during travel. Now I have to ask people to get close so they can read the small font size translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tap to Translate is mostly fixed, thanks for that team. Instead of tapping the pop-up balloon that used to show up only after a copy, now the trick is to copy, pull down, double tap the persistent notification. It's one extra action which is acceptable in the name of privacy. Good first step to restoring functionality. Going forward please look at doing a full revamp of copy permissions, still too coarse grained."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to rate this app 5 star, but now if I could rate a zero I would, but unfortunately the minimum is 1. It used to be the best app when you travel abroad and need translation. But with the latest update they removed so many useful features. Here is the list: 1. Offline translation does rarely work. 2. When you translate in languages such as Chinese, they removed the pinyin 3. You cannot swap text on every screen. You will need to copy and paste everytime. Get it fix google"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app. I find it is quite good on the 5 or 6 languages I use it with. I would very much like to see the camera translation feature improved for usability. I often use it to translate Chinese instruction sheets. I need a way to save the translated image at full resolution from within the app. Screens hots just don't work well as the screen is always junked up with menu's etc
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would give 5 stars if it stopped defaulting to Spanish as the target language for some reason. Helo & Feedback doesn't help either. It's annoying to switch again and again every time I open the app. Also, I've tried clearing data, and clearing history (and selecting ""default language"" again), but it just resets to Spanish when I open the app again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this program also needs to be able to allow you to pause when typing a long sentence/ paragraph. if it has this option I cannot find it & if you tell me if it has that simple option then I will give you 5 Stars. However as it stands it's very cumbersome as I have to speak sentence by sentence. If I stall for more than a split second it halts speech & then back to send just the single sentence😥 Sometimes I can't even punctuate it because it goes too fast. then I have to copy & paste it to chat😣
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Android 10 has really reduced the usability of Tap to Translate. The always present bubble is an interference to other app usage. It was much better when it dynamically appeared when text was copied and disappeared when not needed. It also generates an unnecessary notification. Edit: I Acknowledge the security changes. After reviewing forum post now see the 'Translate' pop-up in addition to copy but unfortunately still not as accessible as before.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new design is wonderful however, in the recent months, the old layout had a new feature which automatically changed the keyboard to the chosen language alphabet (if the language was set up), and since the design upgrade this feature has gone. It's a shame it was one of the best features amongst all android apps, preventing having to annoying change the language. I wish you'll put it back quick."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please make a flashcard feature from the words added to favorite for building word power and vocabulary for foreign language learners. Also make able to export bookmarked words into excel or google sheets.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App is very good in general. But after last update tap to translate bubble is not appearing/disappearing automatically. This degrades the usability nearly to zero. Also I know that this has been mentioned before but I want google guys to see how annoying it is when something has to stay popped up on your face all the time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the redesign they greatly reduced usability. Less lines of text fit in, it is harder to reverse translation or access the history. I am giving 2* just for the translation functionality itself, that is great. The ap UI is total disaster. And of course they deleted my previous review which I made just after their redesign. :/ I hate you, Google!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and use it often. However with the update to Android 10, the option to translate what you copy to the clip board is gone. Before you would get the little hovering icon you could tap. I tried uninstall/reinstall and made sure tap to translate and permissions were enabled. Hopefully it gets updated soon as that is extremely helpful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The update to match the new Android UI is a travesty. So ugly, chunky and difficult to use. I don't need a massive font size and really really really don't need this matching the ugly colours that have been forced on me by the Android interface. Seriously, What. The. Hell. Making everything match your ugly new UI is just going to disorient people even more. It started when you made all the Google app icons look identical, and I guess this is the next phase."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the latest update this app is absolutely awful and this seems to be the consensus. As most reviews I've read state, it WAS working fine but now it's so problematic. Not only is the popup option always on or off but even if I've set it as tap to translate enable mine doesn't even appear permenantly. Also with voice input I've clearly noticed it doesn't want to accept all the words, for example if I say a phrase of 3 words it's definitely has problems registering more than the first 2 word."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new forced auto language detection in conversation mode is horrible. Please don't break what was already awesome, and leave the conversation interface as it was!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since this app was changed its rubbish. I cannot set it up to translate any language from English or any language into English. Settings makes no sense at all. Detect language I type in Spanish to go into English and vice versa. It tells me to remove one of them. Who do Google always have to mess with apps that were perfect ? I used this for 8 years now it's gonna be deleted. Thanks for that. Seems I'm not the only one. Done it. You say reply send feedback. Read my review I already did it NADA
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A really useful and well used app on my phone, especially the Tap to Translate function, where the Tap to Translate icon only displayed after some text was copied. After the update on 30/01/2020 the Tap to Translate icon is permanently displayed, getting in the way of other apps functions. The icon can be moved but the previous functionality was so much better when only displayed after a copy operation. Please revert back to the previous functionality"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, this attempt to create a modern and minimalistic layout has oversimplified the app to the point that its purpose and function are inconvenient to use compared to its online counterpart. This update deteriorated this app's effortless function to a sluggish and buggy shell of what it once was. The speech, camera, and translate functions are not helpful anymore. Everything that made this app special was either removed or complicated to use. I wish that I had never updated this app!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Works well, can be used without internet if you download a language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Once the translator doesn't find massive available bandwidth, it goes into offline mode, and stays there, until you force stop the application and restart it. The older versions had a 'refresh' option which prevented that problem. Really irritating to have to go to Settings and scroll to find translate and force stop it every time the internet gets a bit slow - which in this country is all the time. Please put the refresh option back, or make the application retest the internet connection."

There's no way to remove it. If I turn off Floating Notifications or top screen notifications in settings, then Translate doesn't function automatically upon copying foreign text.

First, if you open the mobile app and do a translation on your phone and also do it with the full translator web page in a laptop browser, the accuracy of the full page translation is much better than in the app. If I don't carefully proofread the app translations before sending them, OMG! They're often not at all accurate. And second, it has a very annoying bug. The setting ""tap to translate"" turns itself off randomly. That's a hassle"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate is the best app for translators to another language. Please add more lines to show words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs for the showing when typing the text than long, because for me it is difficult to edit words when I type wrong. It's so tedious that I have to spend the time scrolling or moving the cursor to find those words."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new Ul is confusing and time consuming. Important information and translation history are not readily and clearly available at launch of app, and you now must navigate and search for the app's features. When translating from Japanese, the app no longer displays furigana (hiragana reading) of kanji, only romaji, which is far less helpful. The app also no longer auto-selects the appropriate keyboard for the language you're translating from (if you have the language pack installed)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely terrible now. Why remove the live camera view translation? Now it takes several taps to view a translation - camera > snap > move the useless tab that covers part of the screen and text > view the translation > click on the x top left > take next photo > again again again!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The copy to translate feature is a great idea. However half of the time it does not work because the app keeps closing in the background. So I have to manually open it again for it to work. Also the app is slow and uses too much battery. I disabled the copy to translate feature now to save battery.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rubbish. Since an update a few months ago it can only handle one sentence at a time. More than this and it's utter twaddle with bursts of repetition of two or three words over and over for several lines. I'm looking elsewhere. Translated the above into Italian - this is what it says in English; Exhaust Rooms. Since an upgrade few months ago can only handle a sentence at a time. More than this and is fear of two-year repetition burst shades and over several different lines. I'm looking elsewhere

The older version was perfect and nothing was bad about it , the only thing I like now, is just the new system upgrade"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old way of copping the text and translating much better than now, it was easy and very useful, just copy the text and open the translator and you'll find the translation, and I can respond without needing to switch between the languages even in the detecting mood, all that I need, just choosing to respond. But now I need to open the translator and paste the text, then translate it, then I need to switch between the languages to translate the respond."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, flipping the languages back and forth in order to see how the translation is from both languages doesn't work. For example, typing 'I am', to be translated into Slovak, translates as 'Som', which correct. But hitting the 'flip' button which is supposed to show the same translation but from Slovak to English, shows instead the same phrase 'I am' in the Slovak box and translates it to 'I am' for English. Obviously worthless. Hopefully the app soon goes back to its former."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Moving this back to 2 stars. The updated design has made everything worse, especially for me the Tap to Translate feature. Use to be when you copied text it would auto paste in the floating icon. Now you have to clear and paste everytime. Sorry but am still just not a big fan of the new design. Please have better text size control. I'm afraid the design is in line with the rest of Googles other app design updates, so I doubt you can 'fix' all that empty wasted space."

The previous version would remember the language you translated to, but this latest version does not. I had to reinstall google translate because the latest version messed up all my settings.

This new format is awful and you have given me no option but to look for an alternative translating app. Well done. Nice job 😉"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am amazed at how this works! I am currently playing a Japanese game called ""Tales of Phantasia: Cross Editon"" on PSP and this app can actually take pictures of the text on the handheld's screen and translate it. I know the story well enough (have played the GBA version that was in English) to know that the translation is highly accurate. On top of that, when you highlight what you want translated, it shows on a separate screen what it was and can match the original."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update absolutely ruined this app. Nearly un-useable in a fast paced international environment where business and communication in multi-national situations needs to be fluid and seemless. Functionally it's clunky, visually it's intrusive. I, and am sure thousands of others, lived and died by the usefulness of this app. In business and just surviving daily life while living abroad this update completely handicapped our abilities. Tap to translate, easy visual access to history were essential."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent method to form communication with others of different languages. It takes some getting used to in order to use conversation mode but if you think before you speak it will be a cinch. When you pause it starts to translate and you need to wait before you can continue. Also, it's best to limit your thoughts to 2-3 sentences at a time so as to prevent it from running into an internet issue. I recommend downloading the languages you use often to the device so you can avoid some of this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Until most recent update it was great app. Now it does not auto detect language being entered, among other issues... but this is a biggie. super annoying to have to select the language everytime you want to translate something.

Wish I knew I could uninstall updates before I uninstalled it. Had to reinstall now stuck with this version"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The amazing floating icon is back and you'll know it because it won't disappear unless you turn it off. So what's the point of having it overlap with other apps? Now you constantly need to move it around in order to not let it interfere with other actions you take. Very annoying. It was perfect in the previous Android version. Now it is a huge annoyance. Please fix this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The previous version of Google translator was really really nice and user friendly. I could just copy a line of text and tap on the app bubble and it could translate it automatically to the target languages according to my preference but now I have to tap on the app bubble then paste it and so on...

It's used to be that when you copied a piece of text, the icon pops up and you can tap it to translate. This is no longer the case. The icon either never appears, or you turn it so that it's always on, appearing over your apps and sticking out like a sore thumb. I've tried all sorts of settings but the tap to translate function just doesn't seem to work the same way anymore. Edit: It's got full permissions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it worked great! fairly easy to use.

When ""Tap to enter text,"" the arrows button to swap languages disappears. I have to click out of the keyboard to swap language.

Sometimes the translation isn't quite right because the system groups the letters wrong. With the previous version, I could group it myself. Now, I have to type or draw it and it's so so so inconvenient and a waste of my time. I don't know why you have to change the translate from image format but the previous one worked and I hope you chage it back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Same problem, it did not work no matter if in conversation mode or just listening. It could pick up English no problem but did not pick up other languages even though they were registering. It would also be nice to have at least rudimentary and basic conversation available offline when traveling; you don't always have an internet connection, especially when exploring another country. I was lucky to have learned some of their language first or I would have been lost. 🤷"

Reverse translation option is in three dots. You have to click it to reach there, which makes it slow for ease of use. Advice for Ui/Ux designers. There is too much space available on the first window of application. You can simply provide an icon with suggestion feature or help in three dots. You are make the whole process sluggish.

However, the latest update made it much more difficult to use as a means of communication in-person while in a foreign country.

But when spoken to slowly and in elementary school-level syntax and vocabulary, it does a 90% job. *REALLY bad point: it seems to arbitrarily choose when to stop ""listening."" This seems to happen mid-sentence, and even mid-word sometimes. This is VERY frustrating. If ever dropped into the middle of a foreign country with just your phone and your shoes, then I recommend this app."

I'm very disappointed in Google's decision to remove this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was really useful until a recent update causing the tap to translate feature to stay on the screen consistently. Before it would give you a 5 second window allowing you to tap the bubble if you needed the translation and automatically disappearing if not. Now it will not leave unless you fully turn the feature off causing the user to have to turn the features setting on and off. It's a bit disappointing for someone who uses this feature for language learning. Please fix Google
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last major interface update it stopped being convenient to use at all, much more actions needed to check other translation options, reverse translation etc, and removing the history of translations from the easily accessible main screen was a horrible idea, now it doesn't even save without you having to give google your permission for collecting your data from web activity to spam you with ""personalised"" ads.

Also the new user interface is so frustrating and hard to use. I want the previous UI that was so much easier and efficient. Edit: the Google translate help community was no use, the guy doesn't even listen to what I'm trying to say and starts blaming me for the problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new camera translation is just very bad as it's literally a shortcut to google lens... Like, OK, the translations are better, but the use is awful, it doesn't refresh in real time, you have to move the device away then put it back in order for it to refresh... This is the same for importing a picture, you have to use google lens and import a file from it instead of just do it on this app that was quicker. I'm putting 2 stars because this removal was done for pure laziness to maintain."

Another disappointment: downloaded dictionaries didn't work today offline, really? BTW it'd be convenient to see full list of my downloaded languages (8 of them) without annoying scrolling. And transaction through English can be very inaccurate (especially for languages with similar structure - e.g. transaction from Polish to Russian through English looks just bad)."

As i was learning a language, i prefer to refer to past translations to enhance memorization. With this version, 2 extra taps are needed to see the history.

Struggles heavily where 'polite plural' is used. Some translations, like French<->Polish are often hilariously wrong. Some expressions are treated as idiomatic while they are not. Someone is trolling?"

This app does not switch to other languages"

This makes this kinda useless as I was using the function to avoid having to swap the language keyboards back and forth while working in one language but needing something translated from another.

Before you could highlight something and the tap the translate button would appear. Now it does not even appear.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I thought updates were supposed to improve an application. This latest update was two steps back. It translates two sentences & stops. No more continuous translating. Previous UI was easier to navigate with. DO NOT UPDATE TO THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! Update: Conversation mode: after translating English to another language app automatically voices translated language over the speaker & there's no way to turn off this function. Very annoying when you're trying to have a conversation.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the in-app camera is utter garbage and has a way, way lower brightness than what my phone's camera would usually have. the low brightness means that it won't even detect text, no matter how much i try. it's not a bother to upload a picture i've already taken, but there's not much point to having a dysfunctional feature in the app at all. there should just be a direct option to upload pictures instead of making users open the camera first."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a great update. Being able to see translation history right away, without extra taps/clicks, was a very useful feature. Was. Before the most recent update, it was also easier to change languages. Others have commented on other issues already, so I won't repeat all that."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"6.28 was the last good version of the app. For those that do a lot of Chinese translation, and are learning to speak it, you know what I'm talking about. For whatever bizarre reason, they decided to remove the Pinyin from beneath the characters. This one small change renders the app useless to learners. Apk Mirror is where you can download the older versions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can not be serious! What is up with huge fonts? Also, put ""reverse translate"" back in the front. It must be in front to quickly carry out conversation in another app. Extra step to get to that feature is beyond annoying. Had to uninstall this verson for now, then manually installed older version Apk from the web. Will never update if current interface stays. Life is back to normal for now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am highly disappointed with the updated version of this app. Prior to the update, I could translate words from a downloaded language offline, but not now. Indeed, the updated design of this app looks more attractive, but less effective and easy to use - in fuction. The history of translated list is now hidden and the translation feature takes too much space. Google translate used to be my only translator, but probably not in the future."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app always worked great for me until the new interface required airplane mode for the translate offline function to work. I am in China. I need the translate offline function to be selectable like before. I don't want to use airplane mode as then I can't do anything else like look up an image to show as support for trying to explain or ask for something WHILE I AM USING THE TRANSLATE APP! Before I could just open the app and use. To turn off other functions or turn on a VPN is not good.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I did download google translate app on my galaxy note 9 it did work beautifully I had the function of ""SMS Translation"" so I was able to translate text messages from any language to English just by clicking on that function , all of a sudden this function is not available my cell phone I only have : - Phrasebook - Offline translation - Settings - Help & feedback I tried everything including uninstall & re install the app few times without success , on other cell phone that I am using this app is working without any problems & I am able to translate text messages without any hassle , how can I be able to translate text messages ? your help in this matter is highly appreciated , thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Share to Google Translate is broken and doesn't always work or go to the app. The issue was not present prior to the major recent update that brought the UI change. Along with that UI change, definitions disappeared, handwriting isn't easy to find and is small, settings like clearing the history and downloading languages are more hidden now, and more that I probably can't remember right now."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Since the last couple of updates I noticed that it is becoming so difficult for this app to capture everything I said. One thing I know for sure that I didn't stutter. The app cannot capture my complete sentence. Always cut me in the middle even though I pronounced every word carefully and with a consistent tone and speed. This has rarely occurred before. This problem is new. Sometimes it can only capture the first word I am saying. Please fix this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is great, but my phone has updated to Android 10 and now ""tap to translate"" is always on the screen, previously it fade automatically and was easy to remove. It just fade when you stop the app or tap on ""show/hide floating"". I've already given all possible permissions to the app. Before, you were can copy some text and automatically translat it, now it is not possible. Please help me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Translations of individually inputted phrases and words seem to work fairly well. App layout and UI is easy to use. However, I wish there was the ability to translate live conversations at the rate of two native speakers conversing. This allows a non-native third party to listen to native speakers. Currently, the conversations mode seems to require distinct pauses between short phrases that suggest the two speakers are slowly taking turns to handicap the conversation down to the app's abilities. Make the app disappear into the background by streaming a normal paced conversation (native to native) live via scrolling text! Not sure if the tech is possible but I believe in you guys!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Incredibly useful! as a Developer the focus on the usefulness of the UI is obvious. I use it w/ Kindle, github, email, and a mobile game. Cons: 1. The ""tap to translate"" icon puts immense strain on your battery even with the languages downloaded. 2. Tap to translate doesn't have a reverse language button like the main screen. It would help! 3. It ""guesses"" what is meant. Necessary, but a literal translation is sometimes needed for specific terminology and lingo."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update ""Tap to translate"" feature maybe looks better but it stopped working properly now it's kinda useless. It doesn't automatically translate copied text, it doesn't automatically change languages chosen to translate between them. I would be happy if you would bring those features back. I will update my review when it will be fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app previously really good but from last month this app don't work only offline translation are available not online/on time translations are done so most of the translations are wrong and even speech output also don't work

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the app is continuously adking me to download Chinese offline, I have installed it so many times but the error download fail is appearing on the notification bar, which is much irritating. I have changed the settings to mobile data, wifi and even uninstalled the app many times, but that stupid notification is not going anywhere. even if I am not connected to the network it appears again and again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm a polyglot and I do love the app, however it can still be improved. 1) The app memorizes only 5 last used languages. I work with 11 languages and constantly searching for the languages in the list is tiring and irritating. 2) Phrasebook allows sorting the liked words by alphabet and in chronological order. This leads to a wild mishmash of words from different languages which is hard to learn. I propose adding another filter, filter by languages. Thanks in advance for considering my proposal."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the android update, the app dot is always showing on the right. To remove that app dot, it will no longer appear and translate once you copy a sentence. It used to appear only once you copied something and then would go away. Now it's always there and never goes away but will translate or it's never there and doesn't appear and translate once you copy a sentence. I understand why it's changed. It's just much more inconvenient now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the Google translator App on my phone for several years. Is almost always perfect for my needs. I translate from Italian to English and English to Italian I know a lot of words in Italian, but I may not know how to spell them, so helps in that way. Often there are memes on Facebook that I don't fully understand so I can copy the text and Google Translate can change it for me so that I can understand what the words mean. Great app... it works very well on my Samsung S9."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cannot download any offline packs. I've got all permissions enabled and yet I am unable to obtain an offline copy of french like I used to do. Works great when there is a data connection. Voice to text is very helpful. Just want my offline packs back. Have got 64 GB of flash and 6Gb Ram. Plenty of room. Having to reinstall every time the offline packs disappear is a hindrance.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am using it for more than 3 years in Russia. It's very helpful app for me specially in a country like Russia where there is problem for communication in English. But recently, Google updated app which is not so user friendly update. In earlier version keypad was getting changed automatic based on language you want to write for translation. Also new layout of doesn't seems that user friendly, may be i am used to old layout of app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hello Google Translate. The latest version is totally made me getting crazy and feeling unsuitable for using it. The option icons for writing, keyboard have been combined. The history searched has placed in other page, not below the Enter Text section. At least, paste icon and new translation have been added for user friendly. We hope the developer may notice the changes that have been made. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate update is horrendous as it can only be shown on top of all the apps. If tap to translate floating icon is hidden then nothing happens when you tap or copy context for translation. The old one where it hides and appears only when you copy context to translate was awesome. Please refer back to the original functionality, as this update made it worst."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Arabic and I use Android and iOS. The built-in dictionary on iOS is just amazing. When I select a word anywhere it translate it with a professional dictionary with clear examples how use that word. The best thing about it that you can select a changed form of a noun or a conjugated form of a verb (i.e. not in infinitive) and it gives its original form. Otherwise, if you put changed form of words other dictionaries don't find it at all. So it's great time to follow the suite."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a short time and its already getting on my nerves. Everytime I click into the app and type in something to be translated it just does nothing. I’ve checked my internet and server and they say my internet is working fine. I've had to force stop, restart and reinstall the app and no change. It would then start working okay, only for the same thing to happen later in the day multiple times a day. What's the point of a translating app that won't translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit: THEY FIXED IT LOVE YALL THANKS Old: I loved the old version of Google translate—it was easily a five star app and one of the most useful apps I've ever had the pleasure to use. This new minimal version, however, sucks. I want to see more information about the words in searching, like synonyms and definitions, the way you used to be able to. Please return those vital features to Google translate. The context around words is just as important as the word itself."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app. Whenever I copied a text, tap to translate would pop up, and I could easily translate. However recently that feature hasn't been working. Tap to translate bubble is always on my screen and won't go away. And when I hide it, I can't use that feature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This latest update is horrible. The only way to use the tap to translate is to have the annoying icon on the screen at all times. Bring back the old way where we can copy the text and the icon shows up. It is very annoying to have the icon on the screen blocking text that you are trying to read and having to move it to read everything.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For goodness sake, I have to constantly crop images with Japanese text (for the text to take up the entire screen essentially) just for the translation to not read everything as an English letter (thinking random kanji/hirigana/etc. are just random letters like 'SSNI' and then follows with some that were actually read correctly), but I still get letters even when I've zoomed in. This used to never be an issue until late 2020, and it still hasn't been resolved."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate currently takes up 831 megabytes on my microSD card. However, it installs offline-translation files only in local device storage, and there is no way to move them to the microSD card. Tap to Translate, which translates copied text with one tap, doesn't activate on device start-up until I open Google Translate, which is probably due to the application being stored on the microSD card, but works fine otherwise. The translation quality is good, but DeepL is better in my experience."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The trend of gigantic software companies making latest version less usable than the previous version continues. Tap to translate is now horrid to use. Before, it would automatically instantly translate what you had in your clipboard; now you need to manually paste it in, and manually press enter to translate. 2 extra clicks required for literally no reason. It has also become humongous. Whereas before it took up maybe 1/3 of the screen, now it's literally fullscreen. Why? I'm not blind."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It transliterates the text, i.e for example Malayalam to English and it shows partial of it only, I am unable to view full transliteration of it, and i see no option, it has plenty of space on the window to show translietation but still no option to view it fully and i see no seperate app for transliteration from google too ... This app already has it built in to some extent but if only it shows full translitaration it helps with pronunciation and reading .... Hope it gets implemented soon"

I understand the update was for security reasons but effectively the Android 10 update rendered the feature useless. I'm rating and commenting to cast my support to enable app specific clipboard permissions. Thank you. In the meantime I'll be attempting to downgrade to Android 9 which I can't imagine is good for security either, but that's how much I relied on the tap to translate using clipboard permissions."

Tried an old installer, worked fine, but all of a sudden also there the lens function popped up again. Hate it. Installed an alternative. Not as many languages, but it will do. Bye Google translate. EDIT Found a workaround. Google Translate back to the old version again. Never will update again though...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is annoying. I use it to translate picture on my drive, but whenever I click camera, it'll auto direct me to instant mode and when there's no pic it can detect, it just went back to home and I need to restart until I can tap Import. So I need to quickly tap Import, faster before it flash back to home again. Please fix this! Also, the image which was vertical now appear horizontal and resulting with some words undetected especially Chinese! It's so annoying to rotate my phone everytime"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I haven't updated in a while until today and I wish I hadn't. The latest updated wiped out my entire translation history. When past updates did not do that. Years of translations are now gone. The new design is also intrusive with an ugly all white background on top of more white. And why must this app usage now be linked to an account when it was just linked locally on the phone to read past translation history? Another annoyance to deal with.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is simply amazing. The instant and conversation translation is great! For some reason offline translations stopped working alltogether on my phone. Uninstalled then reinstalled the app and now it's so so useful. Maybe you guys should recommend reinstalling the app after some updates (I've been having the app for years). And please leave it light as it is - gmaps is unusable on my phone and I used to like that app too.

I'm always fighting a battle for primary space on my Samsung android T-Mobile device. I purchased the largest device storage option available at the time, and the largest SD card supported. But this Google app, like many news apps, only accept Device storage. My device keeps maxing out, while SD is underused. This is s personal battle to not be forced to upgrade."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""Google Lens"" camera interface is incredibly frustrating & unintuitive. The need to open a drop-down menu to display the original text every time is annoying, & the highlighter is frustrating, moreso w vertical or right-to-left text. ""Send to translate home"" isn't usable for individual selections, forcing me to manually copy-and-paste, which I *need* to do to remove random line breaks that often show up in the transcription. Plz change it back the older camera ui was good 😭"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Went from great to mediocre. No longer works with WhatsApp properly after latest update. Used to translate within the app itself, so I could read the messages in english. Now the bubble or in app translation don't work even if I select and copy the text. The language detection is screwy too. Even opening the bubble, pasting, it can't detect that I want to translate from Spanish to English or the reverse and often gives me the same output. On pixel 6 pro. Tried everything. Fix it please."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Android 9 : Copy any text and tap to translate appeared ONLY when copied. This made this app the best !! But now... Android 10 : Not only the ""tap to translate"" won't appear when needed actually on any text being copied, but it keeps on hovering over your screen permanently! How irritating is that ? You only have the option to keep it hovering over the screen or remove it and never see again when any text is copied ! How the updates love to spoil a simple function. PLEASE FIX ! 🙏"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I shouldn't have to open the camera and have internet to simply upload and translate a photo or image already present in my files. It would also be cool to favorite or be able to simplify the languages list. Otherwise, works as intended and it's feature packed!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Got rid of the granular selection on camera translate and replaced it with Google Lens which is NOT what I want. I want to be able to select a sentence and translate it individually; I can no longer do that. NO ONE asked for this type of regressive functionality! Why do you constantly insist on changing things for the worse that weren't broken in the first place???
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As Michael Howarth says why has the interface changed I was used to it and knew exactly how to move around it, it's a very useful app, but why is it upgrades have to change something that works and break it, do you not realise after a long time people get used to how something is set up, then they have to start re-learning how to navigate it? Ok found an older version online installed and disabled updates."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stop replying the same dumb messages no body cares if the team wants the best experience this new look and the ability to translate images are awful why do I have to use Google lens this is bad I want the old version back this new version is not good and you need to use a separate app with the translation sucks the old version could translate really good the images without needing a separate app fix this you shoulddo a survey to see if people like this new version or not this version sucks
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Often times I have to reverse the translation to check to make sure I didn't offend anyone. One time I used the English to Ukrainian translation and it translated exactly the opposite meaning of what I intended. This made the Ukrainian person very angry and I had to edit the translation several times to diffuse the situation. It was AWFUL! It's good for some languages but absolutely terrible for other languages that are not widely spoken globally. If the app is going to offer a translation for a particular language, it should do a much better job to insure it (most of the time) does it correctly or even close would be acceptable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm very disappointed with the update. First, there is no pinyin when translating other languages into Chinese. Pinyin exist when I want to translate Mandarin into another language but it can't be copied. The history function doesn't work well, so you have to retype it if it's deleted. Overall I think the update is not friendly to use, the old version is better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use this app almost every 10 or 20 minutes everyday I do not like this upgraded version the previous version was a lot faster and easier to use before when I selected a paragraph to translate all I had to do was open the floating icon or the pull-down menu and would automatically translate in both languages without having to push an arrow or to change languages the previous version was much faster to use in a conversation and on a daily basis I wish I had the older version back
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New UI is terrible, changing keyboard when changing the language makes no sense, also it keeps asking for backing up my history even though I allow it for like 10 times. This app is used to be 'go to' translation app for every Android user, but after latest updates it is starting to become one of those apps that takes you 5 mins to do a task that should be take 10 seconds. I'm disappointed."

After a recent update and overhaul of the interface, Translate now has a frustratingly user-unfriendly interface. Used to I could see the translation as I typed. Now the translation is hidden behind the pop-up keyboard. Have to stop typing and hide the keyboard to see the translation. Also, I kept thinking the back button on the upperleft corner is to hide the keyboard.. it CANCELS everything I have typed"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app involuntarily hooked Google messages and popped up a window saying translate to English every time I opened up any message. The window was accompanied by a very loud and annoying and unnecessary sounds and notification All of my messages are English and I couldn't find any settings to turn it off and eventually had to uninstall Google translate

Idk why they made a separate app to Translate, since Google Assistant is far more useful, and can do immediate Translation with Audio Incase you dont know how to pronouce words in other languages. However, Google has some of the most useful tools available to all. This one just seems a lot less useful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Use to love using this app before the update that forces the floating widget to stay on screen. In the past you could copy a message or piece of text which would automatically make the widget appear on screen and from there you could get your translation. For some reason the update requires that you have the widget constantly floating on your screen for this to work. This is annoying as it gets in the way.

This was one of them. I was like there is no way this app is causing all of these insane popups and screensavers. I deleted all the suggestions and it was this apps and one more left. I deleted Google translate and all the popups stopped! Ads like drink water, wifi, missed call, and mattress ads was constantly popping up!"

However, I do want to keep and use my phrasebook (now called saved translations) across all devices.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Languages that require you to lift your hand when writing are incompatable with hand written translation option. e.g. Chinese If something can not be drawn in a single stroke, the app behaves as if you are starting a new entry.

Since the update over 90% of the time when i use the camera feature to translate absolutely no translation happens, it's just in camera mode. I really miss the feature of scanning, used it for paperwork so i can read it. This also happens when i try it with other languages, so screwed when in other countries. Will be finding a better translation app, I need for my daily life"

Before my forced up I would copy text and it would pop up. I really hope Google is aware and is working on correcting this issue. All settings is correct so it has to be a glitch with google i sure hope this isnt the new improved version because it sucks. Please correct the problem i love this app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, my JA-EN experience improved after my phone upgrade (S23,) but I may have a suggestion or two. First, viewing in landscape makes the app weird to use. The keyboard and text box automatically take up the screen, so If I want to use handwriting input, the only way is by turning the phone upright again. Can we get a dedicated button for handwriting input? We also need a way to suggest corrections like on browser. It often misinterprets things (ex: 起こる[okoru/happen] as 怒る[okoru/angry].)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Comparing two languages comma as this app is force to do constantly whenever you use it can be very extremely annoying and frustrating.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely terrible most recent update. I rolled it back, and it should have been rolled back already, that it hasn't been after almost 3 weeks means that I probably won't update this app again. -the update reduces functionality , requiring a permanent icon on the screen rather than one that appears at copy past -the update description only describes ""improvements"" without giving any information about the reduced functionality. This in itself is not really OK to do to users who depend on it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The UI in this app is not very well done. Why must I hide the keyboard to reverse translate or to copy the text. There should also be a way to keep the mic open longer. I cannot tell you how many times someone is speaking and they pause just for a second and it cuts them off. I figured through the years someone would have addressed these issues by now. I guess not.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update just ruined the whole pleasure of using the app. Besides the absence of split-screen, the accuracy of translation became worse. Also, now you have to cut off the part of the text yourself due to the word limit, but in the previous version the translator did it itself. Used to be one of the best apps for translating, but now I have to look for something new."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As others have mentioned, the latest redesign has come with many usability regressions as well as bugs. Reverse translation is very difficult to find now. The app often refuses to translate for me, claiming to be offline. This happens even when I have a language downloaded AND am online. When I go to manage my downloaded languages, the app consistently crashes. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app to no avail. The team behind this update should be pretty embarrassed by their bad work."

All inn all, a simple string-map solution like this with no backup, pretty horrible when I'll now just code it myself: write text, translate, save."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is horrible. The UI is terrible now, the Google lens doesn't properly differentiate Japanese words, and clumps them together strangely. The quality of the translations has also seemingly decreased by a LARGE margin. It was just getting to a point of amateur human translation, and it's now plummeted back to nonsensical machine translated sounding garbage. The app was wonderful before this update and I used it multiple times a day. I guess now I'll have to find an alternative."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update broke the app. Little by little this app has gotten worse. Before, I used to be able to translate directly from another text app Line, but then they added tap to translate and I had to have the floating icon.

On top of that, if I receive a long message, now it just translates the first bit of it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Saw horrible reviews starting around February 2020, but I only wanted to use camera translation, so I tried it. Translating Japanese to English of simple two to three word phrases and all it could do was give me a nonsense mix of letters and numbers.

That happens often in this app. Also, I should set the timeout not the app, I hate when it cuts me off when I'm speaking."

This is very odd behavior as in any other app the keyboard behaves properly. Also, whenever I copy paste text from the translated part, there are 2 spaces after every full stop instead of 1. Even when the original input text only contains a single space after each full stop. Aside from this strange behavior on the app in Android, it's very useful to me to be able to translate text."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The interface is 50% of the experience, and it has become more and more obscure as the app has evolved over the years. Apps are powerful when users develop proficiency; that proficiency disappears when users find themselves hobbled by interface redesign after each update. 2nd UPDATE: Developers, are you paying attention? Recent reviews bear out my OP, above. People lose functionality because they perceive the app to have lost functionality. Improve the app, but keep it familiar."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why doesn't the icon just appear when you tap it, like it used to do? It's just in the way sitting there the whole time on the screen. That doesn't make sense. You should be able to tap the text to copy, and then the icon appears. It shouldn't sit there the whole time, in the way. Also, the translations aren't accurate at all. This needs HUGE improvements, across many languages. My friends tell me how badly it translates. Also, the link you keep giving us to read about changes, doesn't work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update, the text is too large and whenever I enter new data to be translated, the default translation to language is the same as the translate from language.

Update: found another app that seems to work much easier. Uninstalled and moved on"

Floating bubble no longer works (it was excellent before the update),gets in the way as it stayed on screen alk the time (it didn't used to), so disabled it. Clunky to use, doesn't remember languages I use as a default, so you have to keep re-selecting (it didn't used to do this), text size is ridiculously large, doesn't remember previous translations.

It use to be when you copy a ward or a sentence the icone showes up.no it is always there and annoying and disturbing, I will need to manually copy then open the app and past to avoid this annoying icon on the side of the screen all day!! I hope you would return it to the previous way, the icon shows up only when you copy something then i disappears after you tap on it to read it."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous version's UI was overdue for an update, but this is not what it needed! After updating, I am not finding the interface user-friendly anymore. Though it was not always accurate in taranslating Bangla to English but was better functioned and easy to use then. I used to translate Hindi from English language or bangla to hindi... and under the language it was subtitled then, but now can't understand the language written. And the reverse translation was easy to change before!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everething works well, but I don't like the last update. The pen and microphone icons at the right upper corner of the text field is very uncomfortable. I got used to tap there to type a word (it was especially handy because the cross icon is also placed there). Now I constantly mistap the microphone when I want to activate text field."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3 star only, suggested when highlighted the words , can auto translate the language what I want , instead go on to tick the translate, and only show up the meaning. thanks"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app was awesome until recently...tap to translate was just what I needed...popped up when I needed it...invisible when I didn't. Now to have quick translation I have to have that stupid floating icon that I keep hitting accidentally. I have a small screen...no extra real estate for that. Also extra steps. I don't like what you've done to the app!! Please give us back the old tap to translate!! PLEASE!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't recommend it enough , it goes such a long way if you give it a little context , it has been my best friend when learning a new language but also of great help in an international community and just to look up the occasional word i don't know or remember in any of the languages I alley speak fluently . Brilliant , handy , versatile , fast."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mainly want to translate YouTube comments. Very annoying to try. Go screenshot, import, highlight some, then if you go back you have to import it again. If you highlight all, it's awkward and too much all clumped up. You also can't deselect/unhighlight although you can clear all. Also editting a larger amount of text is awkward, a huge thing of blank space below a very short text box"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate broke after update. Copied text doesn't auto translate when you tap the app. You have to manually paste it in and then press the arrow for it to translate. This was automatically before and all you did was pressed ""new"" and typed in your language and copied it into the other app. This is a loss of functionality. I use a Pixel 5a."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great but could be easily better. 1) Why is the text entry area only two lines and then a massive blank space in the middle doing nothing before the keyboard at the bottom. It's like decorating the hallway from outside through the letterbox. 2) Please could we have an option of formal or familiar in languages like French that have that distinction. Aside from these, it's just awesome and has helped me so much."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad now after last update, bring it back to previous issue. I uninstalled that rubbish. Bring it back as before. Dear it's clear issue the App is so bad now not only me but everybody saying that so please return it back to it's normal and smoothest issue. It's sticky and slow also changing the smooth way of trouble free working issue before. Please return it back to it's best working way ever. We will keep it uninstalled until you correct it back. Thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a like, hate thing going on with Google translate. It pairs well with Samsung Galaxy Note devices (like). When it comes to transcribing, it is bad, really bad for the Russian language (hate). The app has bugs for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, it doesn't pronounce the words at times (hate). Hopefully, Google will get it right someday on the Samsung Galaxy Note devices."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Makes it incredibly easy to communicate with people that aren't fully fluent in your language or not fluent at all. Makes having conversation so easy in order to help a person or just have a friendly convo. Can also take pictures of witting of a different language and will translate the writing. Can do translate in real time during a convo. Just an amazingly helpf for all the traveling people do these days. Keep up the improvements on the app Google! Love it
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,took a long time to translate a single word. might as well google it

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, has the live camera translate which was done in other apps. Won't translate images on webpages, so if you enjoy foreign cartoon websites it won't translate the text in the images for you. We should be on the verge of correct translation of videos on YouTube by deepfaking lip movements to sync with translated deepfake voice synthesis."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wish & want only one thing from this amazing app is that when I search a certain word , it comes up with the meaning, definition & the use of that word in the sentence ( in English ) but I find if those examples are given in the language chosen along with English then it would be more helpful for everyone to exactly make sense of the sentence. Thank you..!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Mostly happy with this app, however when I need to speed-talk into it, without pausing to catch my breath, for fear that the mic might timeout on me, is ludicrous! 😒 Also with the way this app incorrectly transcribes what is said, I'd recommend a rename to ""Google Lost in Translation"", and highly suggest caution when using it in conversation mode. 😅"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a very good app. Since the update, it's a one-star app. What happened to the different synonyms/definitions of words at the bottom? That was a great feature. Now, it's basically a dictionary, and a not very good one at that. Better to not ""upgrade"" at all than to downgrade it, because that's what happened. Previous version was way better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The audio input won't stay on long enough to listen to the entire sentence. I'm not talking about long and complex ones, just a normal length sentence which I'm saying over the course of 2-3 seconds. The audio input stops after 1-1.5 seconds into recording me and then the app translates only a portion of what I meant to say and after trying 5 times, you just want to smash the phone. Kind of annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a feature on the description page of the app: Tap to Translate: Copy text in any app and your translation pops up Might wanna update that because it doesn't work anymore after the recent Android update. Now I have to copy a message from my SMS app, open the app, paste said note, and translate from there. Whereas before I could just highlight the message and the translate bubble popped up. Easy and convenient."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This might be good for some languages but for Thai it's inept. It does not translate simple things like hours properly. It does not take the height of the sounds to transcribe what we say (though a must for a tonal language). As for the AI part, transcription of our voice can not improve with time, since we can not tell it when it is right. Update : I did send some explicit remarks (eg สองทุ่ม means 8pm not 2o'clock), 2 years ago, but they haven't changed a thing…"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's good for translating most of the languages, The ones you can type yourself at least. I was intrigued by using photos to translate instead of writing it myself to translate but it can not even copy the same text so translation is pointless. It works fine with 'some' languages which use English characters. However languages for example Urdu (from which I translate difficult words from to English) doesn't work at all. It skips several words and gets many wrong."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"was a great app until they decided to make google lens the only means of translation. The previous image capture and text reading function was nearly flawless. But now Google Lens is used as the sole means of image translation and it doesn't work. This is NOT an exaggeration! It actually doesn't work at all, no kidding, see for yourself. It does not detect text, it does not even lift the actual original text from the image like the previous function, which makes the translations gibberish."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is very bad. When I try to speak through the speaker button the first time works but then when try to translate something else the speaker button doesn't appear. I have to go back, delete the first text and It is really became complicated and not easy. Please try it yourself and see what I mean. The reverse button place also before was on the screen directly. It was better. Bring back the old version or I have to search for another option!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the newest update, nothing will translate! The app keeps stopping and crashing. Never seen this many bugs on a Google app before. You can no longer select a large piece of text from a gallery image to translate. You have to select tiny parts of a sentence. You can no longer translate the whole text. Super infuriating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is so horrible. Who thought requiring more taps was the way to go. The old design was clean and simple. I don't understand why people change interfaces so much. Not one person said ""Yes, myspace looks so nice now that I can't customize it"". Also, when translating 姉ちゃん, do you think eonnie is professional? Because, last time I checked, that's not English or a proper translation. Koreaboo translations should be checked. 姉ちゃん means sister. Translate to sister."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Wouldn't it be much better if you are saved transcriptions could actually be exported or copied as a whole rather than arbitrary sections? Or better yet saved as a text file automatically. I just found this translate/transcribe live feature during a 3.5 hour meeting in Thai language to English, then found they can be saved. But now they just sit there in 20 line chunks and 15 ""files"". I can copy every 20 lines but each file has 10-30 sets of 20 lines. Can you add a save as option?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for simple translations or for the more complicated, nuanced and atypical translations. I've been impressed with the app's programed understanding of slang and cultural innuendos. That's something that is difficult for even the moderately fluent multi-lingual translator. Being more than just bi-lingual, the tri- or even the quadri- or penti-lingual user will be able to discern what the defferences between innuendo, slang or humor from what is the literal or the absolute translation of a phrase or text. Losing meaning in translation is no longer a problem for the person who is translating a foreign language into American English or even Canadian English. The nuanced differences in regional dialects and styles is already in the app. For instance, French comes in about 12 different styles or dialects- a translation for each country or region that speaks French. Perfect for the rising Francophone who needs to understand the regional differences between French in France and French spoken in Haiti or what the French Language Institute has determined to be authentic. I AM TOTALLY AMAZED THAT THIS IS A FREE APPLICATION!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the heck??!! No longer simple to use with the camera. Have to take a picture of the whole text, while it's automatically translating as it goes, so you can't see the kanji you are trying to translate. You then have to go back to translate and find the relevant words. Whoever thought that was a good idea? Probably good for tourists, but not for students who need to find the meaning and pronunciation of one or two kanji. I detest how it works now and hope to find an alternative app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Languages are not accurate enough & sometimes it gets stuck on a word & says something random that doesn't make any sense - and each time it does this on many different words, the random thing it says is always the same, my hint that Google is stuck & can't translate. Since I need Google to translate for me but Google gets it wrong often or can't get it at all, I can't use this because I'm being given incorrect information from this app & I will sound stupid repeating it. Unreliable. Unfortunately, this is one of those things in life that need to be completely accurate, because 2 things you can never take back - time & what you say!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently the image translation feature has stopped working on my android phone. All I get when I try to take a picture of text to translate it is a message that says, ""Service inaccessible. Please try again later. (E-810)"". I have tried again later and it has the same result. It is the same if I am on wifi or on a data connection. I even reinstalled the app but it didn't fix it. It appears that the instant translation option is still working though."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and I've used it almost daily living for the last 3.5 years - it's basically essential travelling Europe! Unfortunately, as of about 2 weeks ago, I've lost the offline translation function completely 😕 I was counting on it when I arrived in Italy last week and I've no idea what happened 😫 what happened Google? 😔"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For weeks maybe even a month anytime I try to translate something it shows a message saying ""Can't translate. Check your connection and try again."" I've been having to use the browser version each time, and it works fine which means it has nothing to do with my internet connection. (Having the language downloaded also doesn't make any difference, the message shows up every time)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I often need to check translation of the same text into multiple languages. In the previous versions of the app I would just select the languages from the list and the same text would be translated as many times as needed. Now I need to go back every time and retype or paste or pick it from history same text to get a new translation (btw, wouldn't it be better if the last entered item was at the of the list?)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just did a Samsung software upgrade SM-A750GN/DS. Previously, when translating a line of text in WhatsApp, I would highlight the text, a mini bar would appear. If the entire line was chosen a second bar appeared allowing me to translate. I also had the option to highlight the entire text, tap the copy icon in the main header bar, the Google Translate icon would appear and the main page would appear with the translation. Non of these functions now exist. Previously I would assign 5 stars"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app works great except when you are trying to use the voice option. It just decides to stop listening when some one is talking. Even in the conversation option, just stops listening. Edit- new update has made this app worse, when before it knew i would need to translate from Spanish to English now it will auto translate from Spanish to Spanish. This app seems to have gotten dumber trying to add more style to the translator text box."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use this app constantly, and I find it very helpful. I just find something odd recently. I had a Galaxy S9 and this app worked perfectly. I would copy the sentence in the other language, and then the bubble would appear, which you would tap to translate. I just moved to a Galaxy S10, and now the tap to translate bubble is always hovering on the screen, all screens. How could you go from the app working perfectly to this?!?! I prefer the other way"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Horrible update! Since updating it, it has given me ""download failed, error code 1004"". I've looked up how to resolve my problem & came up with is the same. Download error & error for offline, which is both of the problems I'm encountering. I've been using Google translate for about over 10 years now and not once before have I encountered such problems. This has gone on now for the past 2 months, please someone fix this soon. Resolve to continue using, or uninstall looks like in the future. Thx"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I could not travel without to the countries whose language I do not speak. It makes it possible to communicate with people who speak no English. The only drawback is that as I am currently in Thailand and the language varies whether it is a man speaking or a woman. Unfortunately the app only offers translation from a woman's view. If the developers could offer a choice of male or female voice and also the slight changes to go with the gender this would be the greatest app ever.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous update was good. I often chat with people in WhatsApp who don't speak English or French and I used the copy text then tap on the notification Google Translate to translate directly from my clipboard. Now I have to tap 2 times to clear, paste and translate... Is it possible to rollback this feature? It's very annoying to translate and not easy... Even for the translate in app, this is not clear with the new design."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app but just it should work even with a slow network
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Worked fine, now it barely works. My conversation/speech input isn't working anymore. I can't detect languages or translate anything in conversations other than English to the other language. My permissions are enabled. I've cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I've even gone into speech input settings and region settings to make sure everything was enabled and nothing is fixing the issue. The text translate still works, but not anything pertaining to conversations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new design and layout is simply bad and confusing. The old one was 1000x times better. It would be great if you guys could revert it back. The functionality is also bad. Before we could translate with a couple of screen touches, now it takes five. Read all the reviews and act or lose your user base"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. Latest update was disappointing. Its removed the function where the translate icon automatically popped up when copying text. Now its constantly floating or has to be turned off. This is a dramatic backwards step for the end user. Are these updates not sense checked before global release. Rookie error for the developers. Amazing app still. Thx.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First off, using the camera to try to select text to translate doesn't even work. Second, not everybody writes in cursive and some languages (like the Japanese I was trying to translate) takes more than one stroke so why does the writing to translate think you're done as soon as you lift your finger?? And third, and this is the worst one; when I started the app, it asked if I was okay with Google retaining the images, and I said ""no"" yet you had it turned on anyways. Respect my choice!!!!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a very intuitive app that I used on a regular basis. I especially like the floating icon. However, an update was just made to it that reduces the functionality. What used to be a quick and easy process now requires more steps and the detect language feature no longer seems to work. I'm confused why you did this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be rather phenomenal. However ever since the update it's trash, it's confusing, ugly, and a huge downgrade. Not to mention if you download more than two languages to translate then it'll get them confused, for instance IT THOUGHT RUSSIAN WAS CHINESE!!! They're nothing alike they don't share a single caricature. Terrible, totally useless. Shame because it was an easy 5 star before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really liked the on-screen tap to translate button and was disappointed to see it go in a recent update. It was super-functional, only appeared when you wanted it, you could put it where you wanted and most importantly it cut a couple of steps out of the process - PLEASE bring it back! Edit: I see it's back 😊 - THANKS ... However, it was better when it popped up with COPY rather than being there all the time"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved (past tense) this app. Great for looking up unknown words and phrases, better than a BIG dictionary. And next morning you had a long list of the words that you had checked. Great for learning. ALL IN THE PAST! The update has destroyed the app. Less easy to use, no history without extra clicks the button is either always on or not. This is typical of the 'improving' of good stuff that Google promoted before messing up. Often the original idea gets lost. Rating! You're joking! I deleted it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"new version seems to have greatly reduced functionality. for example, I can't find a simple way to report an incorrect (in this case misspelled) translation. maybe i should post this review under a ""psuedonym"". UPDATED to clarify: this was not in regards to speech recognition. I entered foreign language text and the app returned a misspelled word in my native language. There's no immediate function to report and correct the translation in question, AFAIK."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never expected such a trashy update from Google. The UI is so unintuitive comparing to the previous version (someone prefer nice looking UI over good UX), the translation history is a joke (how one could think that 'oldest first' is good idea to access history). I just feel like using some lame amateur alternative app. Also this 'clean UI' is just a waste of space. I'm afraid that soon there will be normal paid version introduced so today i will start looking for alternatives :)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"First of all, it is difficult to give feedback about the translation and it does not even have the like and dislike option, also the photo translation part is generally weaker than the previous version, for example, it is wrong in recognizing and separating characters. Please solve the problems. Thankful"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What a total dissapointment, a near perfect app becomes a useless piece of junk through an upgrade. I have used this app for years, I recommended it to students. Now the app cannot be used, it forever says check your connection, it's previous simplicity replaced with junk.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,i liked it better before. Now when I translate words it only gives me one of the multiple possible translations. Also the definition is in the language I'm trying to translate. How does that help? I don't mind the interface itself too much. I liked it more before but you get used to it. The functionality shouldn't suffer because of it though! Maybe there's a way for me to change it so it shows ALL the possible translations not just one...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really loved this app but now it only uses the Google lense interface on photo translations. It super imposes the translations on the photo instead of letting me pick which section I want, making it impossible to get better context or make sure things are translated in order. Harder to read, too because the text is tiny. It's a shame because the translations are pretty accurate."

Even when I dismiss it, once I reopen whatsapp for example without tapping on anything to translate it shows again. That is so annoying. I have had and used google translate forever. That is a BUG introduced just this recent update .. please fix it ."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just downloaded translator to my new phone and no longer works like it used to on my other. Someone will leave me a text on messenger in a foreign language as I would put my finger and hold that message on the bottom will give me an option to reply or copy. I would tap on copy and on the right hand side the symbol translate it would pop up and I would press and the message will be translated into English. That is no longer an option. Can't get it back to working like it used to. Frustrated.

Before it would pop up only after you copied text you wanted to translate and then it would automatically disappear afterwards and arrive again after you copy again.

Online it is quick and efficient, but as someone who often goes to places without good phone service, that issue is very annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ever since the new update the writing space has gotten too small so it's difficult to write larger characters (Japanese/Chinese) without going off screen. Please add an option to adjust the size of the writing area. Tap to translate is useless now because it stays on screen when I don't need it and doesn't appear when I copy text anymore.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Perfect in translation as compared to other translation apps that I tried. But improvement is needed in the offline mode - it doesn't work yet. I went to some places where google is not available and even though I had downloaded the languages in advance - knowing what to expect - I was completely disappointed; it didn't translate at all.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It really is a good app. Translations are back far the best when it comes to machine translation and also has a good interface. But it would really be handy if a feature to directly translate from screen is added as situations where you can't copy texts occur often and we need to take screenshot then translate it or type the whole text in a language we don't any clue.

I'll keep watching the updates and hoping for the automatic paste in there floating icon.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dont update! I updated to the latest version, but the new UI doesn't do the job anymore. There is no more two sided translate, now you speak you language, they hear it, then you must back out of that page and select language two then they speak and you hear it, then back out of the page... rinse and repeat. It's not usable this way. Fortunately I did not update in my other phone, so when I'm home we talk with that phone. This phone I switched to Microsoft Translator which sort of gets it right"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its previos version is very cool and helpful. In previos version there is feature in which whenever we copy the POPUP is visible and we can find tranlation, but in new version there is lack of these feature. Instead its has always showing popup so it is notmuch cool and also it comes in between screen. So I suggest to Bring that feature back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is the area where you type so damn small? The app literally only allows 1/4th of the screen to be used when you're typing something to be translated. What a terrible use of space from the app. At the same time, there is literally half of the screen unused by the app while you're typing. If you're typing anymore than a short sentence, it's cumbersome."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hope Google is aware that now, after the last update, the bubble won't disappear after using translate. It stays on the screen ALL the time and displaying over all apps. Update: Why change something that was working perfectly? Now You've added more steps in between which makes it like any other dictionary app. Don't get me wrong, I love Google translate, I use it all the time. My rating is only for this last update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It does not always translate correctly. Infact most of it is incorrect. The Spanish spoken in Mexico is not exactly the same as the Spanish spoken in Honduras. This app does not take that into consideration. Other apps do, so it is possible. And the difference does matter. Even without that issue this app does not translate properly. It's not just the app it is even worse with the web version. I love Google and use it for everything, but this is a huge prob for me and I will have to go elsewhere."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was good now that I have updated the translation stops before the end of the sentence most of the time. For example using the voice from Rosettastone ""I drink water"" stops at ""I drink"" and sometimes just ""I"". This problem did not exist before I up dated the app. Ironic as the update includes real time translation! I am having to use a different app for the full translation at tge moment until this is fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1. Most of the time, the speech to text option listens to the full sentence but only jots down half of it. This is happening for every language. 2. Please improve the quality of English <> Japanese translation. I've been using this for a while now and almost everyday I find some subtle mistake in the translation. DeepL is much better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before i can use it without internet connection but after i updated it is useless it wont translate anymore, I will finding other apps offline."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As an Australian living in Germany, this app has been an absolute backbone for my studies and when I'm on the move in everyday life. When I want a quick translation for something, whether it be written on a sign or sheet of paper I can translate it. Whether it's said or must be searched for it will show up as requested. Some fine tuning is still needed in relation to the word choice accuracy and sentence structures but other than that Google has created an essential for language translating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You should add a new line key to your app and maybe fix the tap to translate or improve it. Switched from an old Android 8 phone (Samsung S7 Edge) where if I would copy any text, the translate bubble would pop up to ask if I want to translate, but this function is not working properly on Android 11 (S21), where I either have the option for the bubble to be turned on all the time or have a ""Tap to Translate is on"" notification present in the Notifications all the time => garbage."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the last update the floating button isn't appearing anymore like before. Before when you selected a text and you pressed copy the floating button was popped it on the screen, now it's not like that anymore but you have only 2 choices: 1 - always on the screen ( really in the way for some other things) 2- always off the screen and than not handy. I really would like to get back to the option that the button is popping it on the screen every time you select a text and you press copy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new January 2022 update has ruined an app I use CONSTANTLY. The design is nice but the UI is more difficult to use and take more presses and copy/pasts than the old version. This new update definitely needs to be fixed. If I'm chatting with some friends in what's app in a foreign language, it should be easy as possible to translate it quickly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Google translator (at least as rendered in its Android version) was changed recently to a stupid simple-minded version that's only a fraction as useful as its preceding version. I wonder what ever possessed Google to ruin the translator. Worst of all is the removal of reverse translation, which was a convenient tool for refining the original input until the reverse-translated results were effectively equivalent to the original input."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really dislike the new ui. It is not intuitive to use, lacks helpful information visible from the main screen like recent translations, and does not appear to auto adjust my keyboard language like the old one. There should be an option to opt out of this redesign, it significantly reduced my productivity in the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update has made the app pretty much unusable. Google translate on mobile was previously a brilliant, quick tool that was clear and easy to use. Unfortunately, this new update completely ruined all of those years of trust. Slower, more annoying to use, and has far less accessible features. Congrats! If you're like me, reading countless reviews and seeing the same, seek alternatives! This new terrible update forced me to look at other lang translate apps, and I haven't looked back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Currently in Korea, where they issue many emergency notifications to your phone. I have to use a translator app to determine if it's just bad weather or something more serious. This app will not recognize newly dowbloaded images or screen shots. It makes it really difficult to translate something I can not copy and paste or immediately capture with my camera."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I adore this app, it's extremely helpful and pretty useful. I'd like see more meanings and samples of usage for words. Yeah, I know it's not a translator purpose and is a dictionary one, but just translation sometimes odd and doesn't make a sense. Other issue that I experience all the time.. why the heck voice typing in Gboard (Google keyboard) works in a much better way than similar in Google translator or should I say only there it works."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While the service itself is good, this app does everything to render it useless. No matter what settings in the app i use, it changes translation pair from what i need to what it wants. So i end up translating Spanish back to Spanish, instead of into English. And there is nothing you can do. It is extremely annoying, to say the least."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After changing from galaxy s8 to s10, it stopped intercepting highlighted text. In previous s8 whenever I highlight the text Google translate would pop up as a floating icon with already ready translation. Moreover it didn't need to be on or floating on main window all the time. It was running in the background. What might be issue. Current version even if the icon is floating on the screen it does not intercept the highlighted text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is a terrible big bug in this app for a long time that they do not tend to solve it and that is why I give them this score :"" you comfortably type for a long time and when you tap to translate,suddenly the app closes and you miss all your writing.The same happens when you edit tour text."" Is there anything worse than this? That is crazy!!!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New changes made it difficult to learn new words with this app. Earlier I was able to simply remove unnecessary words from my history, so my history worked as my favorite words list. Now I have to add words to favorites and to learn them I need an extra click on the favorites icon. BTW would be nice to be able to change the default translation on the fav words list. Maybe you can make two versions of the app, one old and one new for the people who prefers simpler layout?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Using the ""tap to translate"" feature in the notification bar is now slower than just opening the app itself. The whole original purpose was convenience; I highlight the text I want to translate, hit copy, and the 𝘛𝘢𝘱 𝘵𝘰 𝘛𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦 feature would just translate the most recent thing in my clipboard, but now, I both have to manually backspace whatever was previously there (a potentially several-days-old translation) AND hit paste. Defeats the f***in' purpose. It's a step backwards."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Floating window doesn't hide after update. I have the latest version of the app. Before the update the bubble was always hidden and when i copied a text, then it appear for a few seconds so i can click and see the translation if needed... Now it's always visible, sometimes blocking buttons from other apps, VERY ANNOYING. And if i drag it down as suggested it just disappears forever, it does not come back after i copy a text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Stop work properly. It wtrites app that I don't have internet and use offline version, but I have very good internet in the same time"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst after update, you will need to switch between languages to translate unlike the previous version. The previous version select the language translated from why translating back to the language but in this version, if you translates from Spanish to English, if you want to translate from English to Spanish, you will need to go into the app and switch over again which really sucks. Thank God I still have the old version, just deleted the current version and transfer to transfer the old version"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great. It's very useful in my quest to learn to speak Spanish. Four stars because it is difficult to edit. There is not enough room to edit easily because there is only a small amount of space on the top of the window. There is a lot of white space below that is wasted. Please change it so editing can be done much easier. Also, when a word is modified, extra letters are generated, which then have to be deleted. That is unacceptable. Please correct that bug."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a great feature and very helpful. Just wish it had languages from different islands too. Like chamorro and Carolinian from the CNMI...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this app since I'm in China but new version is very very bad. Tap to translate is even more worse, before I just what I copy it past automatically, but now you tap translate then clear old text then past new text then translate, at the old version, when you click on the history, it first shows the newly (first one), but now it starts and shows the old translation when it first installed. And many things. Just simply said it's really bad 😔"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It does translate when typed in, but anything from another language to English is very annoying. Used to be good and easy to translate with the camera (especially when my dad needed to translate from English to Chinese or Japanese to Chinese), but now that is not the case. Since they got rid of the real time translation and made it so that you have to take a picture to translate into a transcript. Edit: was told to reinstall to fix problem and it worked."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you drag the ""Tap to translate"" bubble to the X on the bottom of the screen, the app warns, ""Hide Tap to Translate Icon?"" and says ""This icon needs to be visible"" as in ALL THE TIME. This makes the app almost unfunctional. Potentially very useful app, but the Tap to Translate bubble is either up and on top ALL THE TIME, or completely absent is absolutely brain dead."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app, especially when processing pics."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When you're taking about upgrade, it means that you've added improved features. Now, the floating icon does not disappear after seconds like it used to before..... Another observation is that it's very slow and cannot be used for quick translation purposes. I think something should be done about that....."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For an app that does all languages? It does a half decent job. But if you need reliable translation in a single language? You're better off downloading a translation app made specifically for the language you need. For example, it's alright for a passing tourist in Japan, but it seriously sucks for trying to study Japanese or translate conversations in real time. Half the time I understand the Japanese better than the app does! & I'm barely an intermediate student in Japanese!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,After some advise the app is working off lime as well as on- line when flight mode is enabled. Thanks
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a great app to use and very educational. Be wary of small problems that can cause errors in translation. Even this app is prone to minor troubles. You should always double check spellings and if you think something is amiss then manipulate spellings to find similar words. I have been using it for six months on a daily basis and have had major success with it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After 'INSTANT' function updated, minor languages are not able to be recognized automatically. I have to press 'Scan' button all the time. Furthermore, the camera lens is out of focus, it doesn't read texts because its too blur. I am very suspicious that You Google really tested all the languages and functions you have. Very disappointed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Translation is really accurate. Turkish-English translations are really decent and it really helps. Also, it helps me to learn German too. But, it has a real issue, and that is that it literally has no dark mode. An app in 2020 must have dark mode automatically enabled or at least it should have an option to turn it on. And since I ussually work late nights, I'd be great to have the dark mode option. Can you tell this request to the person behind the app? Thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do the developers even use this app? It's horrible. Please try living in a country where you don't speak the language and test this. First issue, tap to translate, why on earth would i want the icon on my screen the whole time? Second when you do a translation, why is the box for reading it so small? Third; translating apps and websites with the photoscan feature is such a painful process, going back and forth for each new screen... I really feel like translation should be built into Android."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolute junk just like everything else Google releases these days.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The game play is decent, could open world exploration. But could use more languages and be polished up. 7/10 Would play again"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to this app? The translate bubble used to pop up right after copying text. Now my options are to have a bubble permanently on my screen or choose to translate from my notifications screen. Also it isnt auto detecting languages anymore and I have to constantly manually choose them. I rely on this app heavily and as of yesterday it just became a complete disaster. Please PLEASE restore the original functionality!!!!! EDIT ------ no, it is not working as before. Please fix this app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very nice app but you changed one thing that I don't like. It used to pronounce slower if I press the pronounce button second time right after it. Now it doesn't do that. I see on the settings about the adjustment. However, sometimes I just listen it fast but for some words i need to listen slower so why you have changed this? Please make it again or let us to do it with some other gestures."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The feature where user use to copy text and a popup appeared has disappeared. Now I always have to have annoying bubble around my screen or notifications bar. The feature should be introduced again. It's not easy to open notifications bar on NOTE 10+ because the screen is long and the annoying chat bubble can't be customised in regards to size or positioning.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please undo your ""improvements"" to translation from image. Not a single thing was actually improved, basically everything is worse. Translation quality, ability to pick what in the image to translate is no longer available. Formatting sucks, if you're translating from Japanese which is read top to bottom, the translated text will be rotated and reading order can be random. Aaaand you now have to log in and have your images added to your account. Seriously, not a single positive thing was added."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi there, Tap to translate icon doesn't disappear on top. I'm using Google translate during gaming. Kind of annoying there. Much better like the old one. Only highlights all the text than the tap to translate icon appears. If we not using the icon. It disappeared in 2 or 3 secs. Change it back! Yes i read it. Why terminated that feature?. Highlights, Copy and automatically Tap To Translate icon appears. On that you guys can get 5 stars rating from me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instant translation bug still here years later. The first time I launch this app after freshly installing, it works. I agree to the camera permission, point my camera at some text and it instantly translates. After this initial use, instant translation ceases to function, instead asking to take a photo to translate. Sometimes deleting the app data fixes it, or I have to sudeload an older APK to regain the function. This occurs on several different Samsung and Google pixel devices I have owned."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was amazing before the recent update. Now the floating instant translate button is either permanently stuck on the screen or I have to disable it completely. Previously the floating translate button would only appear if I tapped in a text box such as WhatsApp, email or text message etc. Google why have you changed this?!?! Please can you revert this back to its previous function or I'll probably just uninstall this app Otherwise the app is great!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to ""tap to translate"" being automatically hidden until you hit ""copy"" on something (now it's always/never choice only). Running Android 9 where before it worked fine and hid automatically when not in use. Now, even the ""copy"" part is broken and the icon always floats. Also, less important / personal preference, but not a fan of the new interface. Please fix tap to translate!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is worst. I specially liked the tap to translate feature how it used to translate from chosen language. But now everytime i have to select the language in which it is written and the language in which I want to translate to. I liked the previous update before the UI and everything got changed. The UI is also bad, so large screen that it doesn't feel appealing at all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, used it on Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Mandarin, written, text to speech, conversation to conversation, so flawless! But the Feb 16th update, updated about 7 times, but wouldn't install... Finally had to uninstall and reinstall, only way the update would take, even clearing out cache and stopping the Store wouldn't do the trick. That's the most install issues I've ever had with a Google product. Fyi developers & engineers."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ok Google I will say you all just spoilt the best easy to use app I have on my android. I am living in a country where I am constantly translating texts every single minute I am on the phone. It was much easier when the pop up shows once I copy a text without switching screens. Now it's always there constantly or I have to always start navigating to notifications to switch it on or hide for every text I copy. Bring back the old interface please
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Maybe for others but not for me. I downloaded this for the offline translations. Now, for basic phrases this is a pretty good app. But for the transcribe feature.....let's just say it failed miserably. Maybe it's the difference between Castilian Spanish and the Spanish spoken in the Dominican republic? I don't know, but the translation made absolutely no sense. On to the next translation app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have no idea why people are rating this app under 4 stars, it's straight to the point, isn't complex at all, works fine, doesn't crash, translates in seconds, has a lot of different languages! And I can keep going. This app is great for all people, you can use it on the go OR just translate anything you want in seconds! Again, awesome app. Give google some praise, please."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it. But sometimes while translating into other laguages ,there are multiple ways to write/say the same word and sentence (like translating english to japanese)but it shows only one. Thats one thing that sort of disappointed me. Still the app is great and useful. 🙂 For some reason the speaker doesnt work while offline so what do i do with file downloaded for offline use?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a really good app, as previous translations could easily be found and seen. Now it seems it has been updated, and All history has disappeared, and recent translations that might be needed again quickly have to be re_input,which is very inconvenient. I am sure things can be saved but there is no menu and no obvious way to do so.not happy"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was excellent before the last 1 or 2 updates. Now, It takes too much time to show the meanings and translation. The biggest problem of all; On mobile data, it always says, You are offline, even after having a good internet connection. This is irritating! P.s.: I tried reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, and also gone through my phone setting to confirm no fault from my side."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really bad with translation and makes the simplest words sound really weird. But it means I can talk to my friends so I use it and just try to make out what they mean. I've kinda learned how to speak Spanish (even though I suck at it) but at lease I can kind of understand using this app. It's not perfect but it's something. Recommended for people who just need a rough translations but not for people who need accurate translations
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is a awesome application for online translation. But in offline it doesn't work properly.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible performance (gets stuck when clicking the voice button, gets stuck and after 5 to 10 seconds doesn't show the language you're translating from) , terrible audio translation (only detects 1 or 2 words in a sentence 80% of the time, which is REALLY annoying ) , and if you use it regularly you often find out people don't have a clue of what you're talking about after reading the translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What Happened??...This app used to copy and paste whatever language translation you want, now every time you paste, it's English... Please fix ASAP"

I have to click the translate button to be able to see the whole thing and struggle to change something in the text. I use this app only because it can translate long paragraphs but it really becomes an annoying experience.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before update: 🎙->🎙 . After update: 🎙-> ✖ ->🎙. I use the microphone translate quite often. After updating the apps, I now have to clear the current translated text before I can click the microphone button again. This is so not used friendly. And it's time consuming. Second, the new transcript feature was cool. Please make it available for Japanese language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Edit 15 April 2022 You guys change the ux with previous version. I like it so much. Had to uninstall. The new update was horrible. The UI good, but the UX is so ugly. Took many steps for copying. Please go back with the previous version. While reading ebook, I use to press two steps for getting the translation. Now it took five steps. Super annoying while I am reading. Please fix it!"

Translate functions in a browser window, but the app is dead now. Deleted, reinstalled, and all other suggestions to no avail. Answers from experts do not provide help but blame the phones, the connectivity, the available ram. Zero stars. 5/20/2023 I hoped this would magically start working especially after OS upgrade. NOPE. Uninstalled. Just sad."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,You've gotta at the very least respect translate. Some of the greatest translation programs in existence in my opinion. It needs plenty of language updates thanks to all of the constantly evolving dialects and language to language translations that kind of stay improper. Even if it's slightly like Spain spanish vs Mexico spanish vs American spanish. Though it has these as options to download the databases need more expansions constantly and a heavy revolving system to Auto update and adjust.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate is awful with Android 10. Having a the constant icon is annoying, especially with the phone wide dark mode. Dragging it to the bottom is not a solution, as that disables the function anyway. Might as well use the main app. If you can't get a security exemption to read the clipboard, I'd suggest changing the notification. Make it display the translation window when pressed. It will be way faster than the icon and the other stuff is not as important as that functionality."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update makes this app unusable and awkward. Especially for Chinese, where the Chinese writing is massive for some reason (which is what I'm translating into English, so why would this need to be massive?). The pinyin is below and requires scrolling down for some reason and is tiny for some reason, and then English which is scrolled further down again. If it's possible please revert back to the old app. I also left feedback in the three dots section of the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All the time the icon is visible. I just updated android OS 10 and all the time the icon is visible. With OS 9, It only appeared when I selected and copied the text. As I can do to make it turn on translation but do not see the icon on all screens without needing it. When I hide it, it indicates that it is necessary if I require to translate. I repeat before it was hidden and could translate without problems."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This new version looks good but needs some enhancements like enabling dark mode, making fonts smaller, adding words family, syncronizing the history with the web version, moving saved words icon into the main menu, changing the keyboard language based on selected language in the app, and trying to support more language speech out like Persian. Many thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm looking for two options that can be manually turned on and will stay on until they are manually deactivated. Auto language detection: Auto translation: It's very hard to know what someone is saying when the translation just cuts itself off when others are still talking or someone else with another language starts speaking. I'm not sure what causes this to happen. But it's very costly to me. If these two options could be implemented, I'm sure it would save me and others time and grief."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was exceedingly frustrating to use. the app kept insisting that I didn't have enough space required to use the offline function even though I had many many times the space required. I uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times and even attempted to delete the entire contents of the download folder and the cache to no avail. If you have great service and an unlimited data plan it might work good for you otherwise avoid this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No. your reply is not helpful. it seems you don't understand we want. I'll say it again ""WE DO NOT WANT A PERMANENT FLOATING ICON *NOR* A PERMANENT NOTIFICATION"". just go back to how it was before ie the floating icon appears only when text is copied and disappears automatically a few seconds later. Google is the master of ruining user experience."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The reason I gave this 3 stars; I used to throw away a word and when I clicked the back button after translating it into Russian, that word was displayed in the recent searched section. I also use it in the ""Tap to translate"" section of Google Translate. And this application is very large. For this reason; I'm using ""Yandex Translate"" anymore."

The tap to translate icon is always on the screen and I cannot kick it out of screen. I have played with all mobile setting but it still there. So I have to give up this option by leave it off. Thanks for last time response on my last review, I would appreciate let me know what is going on and what I can do to not lose this useful option. Thanks"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new version layout, want the old one back. It worked better. Unfortunately, this attempt to create a modern and minimalistic layout has oversimplified the app to the point that its purpose and function are inconvenient to use compared to its online counterpart. Everything that made this app special was either removed or complicated to use. To clear history you have to Go into the Google account ... instead just tapping twice in the app before. I wish that I had never updated this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very helpful app. I have an advice that you should consider it as top priority for the next update. I can easily swap and change languages, but when I click on the content box the tab of changing languages disappear unless I have to go back. Please always keep the languages bar visible in all conditions. Again this is very serious problem and you are google. Biggest internet company in the world. I'm sure you can fix it. I don't mind even paying for the app. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No sound A useful app when it works. For some reason, the app decides that the volume is off when its on and i cannot hear the translation. And yes, i have Uninstalled it, reinstalled it, cleared the cache, turned my phone off and on. FIX THIS BUG. In addition to the above.... I installed translate all and the voice worked on both apps. I then uninstalled translate all and google translate still worked. So now i know how to fix Google translate. Ha ha."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For a long time I convinced myself that this app was actually good. But now as I've learned more of the language that I used to use this to translate for, I've realized that this app is terrible and very rarely ever says the actual thing that you're trying to say. Maybe you all need to take a page out of Duolingo's book and find some people that actually speak the languages that you have available, so that you don't look foolish when a native speaker corrects the translator app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I believe it does a decent job translating from English to other languages and vica versa. It just crashes sometimes and you have to go into the settings and turn the tap to translate back on and you are good to go. I can't give it 5 stars cuz it is not perfect. It is a pretty decent program to talk with someone who doesn't speak or understand English and if you can not speak or understand another person's language either.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please bring back the old version. Present version is complecated. It doesn’t show definition for every word like before. It shows defination only for few words. Also voice conversation was better before. Right now its time consuming🤧 And there’s lots of problems happening. New version is not user friendly 😭 Please bring back the old one. This a very important tool for me so please😭😭
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The last update really reduced the quality of this app. It had been very useful in learning various options for words and how they were put into context. It seems a lot of the previous functionality has been eliminated or reduced. I am so bummed. I just deleted this app and am looking for something better.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please add"" Suggest an edit"" button to the app to get 5/5 stars. The best translator available except not being able to edit wrong translations and bad microphone sensitivity. Translates even photos of signs and packages. The voice detection needs improvements. The person had to sometimes yeal at the phone and sometimes it translates background noise. But please let me change the wrong translations and display such edits to me. Using it for pronunciation training an bad translations annoy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has been hugely helpful travelling through Japan. However recent updates have broken the translate to and from function. The app is ignoring my selection of translate Japanese to English, and randomly chooses what language it thinks you're speaking. For example It will default to translating English to Japanese even though Japanese to English is being spoken and has been selected. Using Samsung s21ultra - latest firmware updates"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Works just as described. I am Super Impressed each time I use it. Most impressive translation I got was using the live picture option with my phones camera for a small specialty tool set I purchased but the instructions were in another language on a small index card. I just hovered over the card then saved the image. It literally took just seconds. I Recommend this App all the time. Way To Go Google !!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dont know why it's on my device that's mobile, I don't need translation. I'm very familiar with my language! It's on my device because my device is compromised!!!!!!!! And Google is absolutely the worst to call for assistance in securing account. Hackers are changing my country and using apps from different country and the apps they use are still in development. Somebody please help!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As per usual, Google has changed the UI out of nowhere and moved many useful features 3 extra clicks down a random menu. There's so much dead space now that used to have useful information and utilities. Why? If switching to a new design language makes things less functional or convenient, maybe reconsider what changes are made."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new design is minimal but way worse. I liked seeing my recent history on the main screen as it has phrases I would want to use again quickly. It is less easy to see the Pinyin for Chinese translations. Chinese keyboard used to be automatic when translating from Chinese, but no more. The new version is broken. It was the best translation app before this garbage update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst update that google has ever made to the google translate application, both in terms of the confusing UI, the translation that doesn't appear just pops up blocks and says to check the network which in fact my network is fine, the bubble feature is not hidden automatic and many more, I hope the previous version is returned, because I think many will be disappointed with this version because of its failure!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can download languages in order to translate them while offline, but attempting to use the camera to do so will only give you a message telling you to download the language if you want to use it offline. Edit - have tried the developer's recommendations. They did not work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Same comment than below. It was great until 1 week ago that started failing. I updated my mobile, but transcript is almost unusable. It keeps stopping, it doesn't catch simple dialogues most of the time. I've tried with another Android device and it is the same. Highly unreliable now. Still, I use it a lot to fine tuning my vocabulary in English. Could you fix it?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Was a good app, until I updated it without checking the reviews 🤦. After fixing it (just go back 2 updates to the old interface!), to be *really* good, when reverse translating, stick to the written format entered. E.g. I put in a French phrase, then reverse translate the English to see if I'm right. So if I'm using ""tu"" don't you change to ""vous""; don't swap ""il faut"" for ""tu dois"" etc. I specifically want what I wrote, just absolutely correct. I still don't trust it academically."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well the update sucks,it is a down grade,things have not improved at all,the app is now not as good as it was before. Translate can be good.Must use it right or it will hurt people.Must reverse translation back and forth until words dont change.must keep rewording until desired message is achieved.All translators i have used work this way. If you just type message and then copy translation this will reverse many of your words having opposite meaning.keep messages short makes it more easy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love that app. Now I have to open up the app in order to translate copied text, sooo much more work. Before last 2 updates it was all about just coppying the text and the app would open in a floating bubble. It was perfect and will dissapear straigt after. Now the floating bubble is on my screen all the time and I can't remove it. Nothing special left about this app"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For the past week or so, my translator is not working on any language or Facebook or Instagram or online."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is very nice and awesome, But one thing is that it would have been better if it had a popup translator. No third party app would happen at night.Sometimes it is not possible to translate without a browser. That's why it will be better if you add magic translator or popup, whatever it is called. Its last update was not good. Many mistakes are made while translating. Not translating correctly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just got a new phone and... What in the world did they do to tap to translate? Dear God they absolutely ruined it. I regularly translate between English and Portuguese, and in an old version, it would easily recognize which language was being used, and translate to the other, and vice versa without extra inputs, now you have to manually change all of the languages every time. What a horrible update. Fix it fast please."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Last update made the handwriting section is too small for Japanese/Chinese characters. Make it bigger. To hard to write kanjies. Also if you want to press ""new translation"" you have to hide the keyboard first. It's so annoying. Btw in Russian version of the app ""new translation"" sounds stupid: add translation (like add new translation not translate)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate has a feature called Transcribe, which can transcribe speech from one language to another in real time. You can use it to follow along a lecture, a speech, a podcast, or a conversation in another language. You can also adjust the text size, theme, and speed of the transcription.Google Translate can translates text, speech, handwriting, and images in over 100 languages. You can use it to understand foreign texts, websites, signs, menus, and more. Thank You Google Translate☺️☺️☺️."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The quality of translation is very erratic. But also the UI of the app degraded significantly with recent updates -- history used to be visible but now needs two clicks to acces it, there was a button for reverting the translation direction but now it got pushed under a drop down menu.. Both of these were very useful functionalities."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't change the keyboard to Hebrew automatically when it needs to, it could before, but suddenly it just doesn't want to."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's not giving the accurate translation again
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google always find a way to ruin the user experience. They just forced Google Lens and it's very annoying, if it isn't broken do not fix it, the app was great as it was. Update: then you should work on fixing Google Lens before adding it to other products like Google image search, it was perfect before Google Lens too."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,UI is terrible now. Crashes whenever I try to scan a photo to translate which is the most important feature for me. You made the app worse in every way. Couldn't you have just stopped when you made something good. If I have a fridge from 1950 that thing will works. The manufacturer doesn't forcefully enter my home and break the machine in the name of 'updates' that are really just PM resumé bait. Why you break one of your most important apps? You did this on purpose. Why
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"dear developer, could you make some adjustments for the english, I mean. . what if you make a difference between US and UK translation, especially for sound feature, maybe you can make a pop-up choice when users tap on sound button, so users can hear the right pronunciation from both languages based on what they choose. thanks :)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app stopped working all of the sudden, it keeps showing can't translate, check network connection. But my phone network is good. I'm really disappointed in this app, I even had to uninstall it and install it back but still not working....."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for translating foreign datasheets and signage abroad. Update suggestion: it would be great if the augmented reality/instant view worked with screenshots/imported images. This would allow the user to see the location of each translated word which would be handy for images of data tables with row and column headings, found online using the same device running the app. In its current state, I can individually select each word, extract text and then translate but it's a bit of a faff 😊"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You download the languages you need in advance because you won't have internet abroad and when you get there and have no Internet it tells you you need to download languages to translate offline (and suggests you download them now, whilst you have no internet). Get the internet back and there they are, all downloaded and ready to go, switch it off, oops you need to download languages to translate offline (why don't you download them now, whilst you have no Internet...)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quick translation become BS. After every time I open the app ""Floating icon"" function breaks. Before icon just disappeared and when used quick translation it appeared again, but now I have to enable this function every time, because it won't work on its own. When I translate from one language to another it doesn't suggest me the language I translate from anymore. Switching every time between two languages plays on my nerve. Moreover, now I can't instantly paste text tapping on icon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Material You update has rendered this app almost useless... This used to be my most used Google app. My girlfriend is latina. I used the tap to translate feature constantly. Now, I no longer have that feature. My UI doesn't have a settings icon. It only has a feedback button. How can I roll back to the previous version? Who asked the user base what features were important prior to making such a massive change? I'm QA with 20 years experience. I've NEVER seen such a horrible fail before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"That version is stupid. The icon should not always stay on my screen. The previous version was nice. Sometimes you should understand that not all versions need to be modified that way. Just update it to put something new. But no need to change everything to make it worse as if updating is a constant requirement. When a version is good, you have no need to modify it. It can stay for years."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This application is really great but one problem is that.. if I saved any vocabulary afterwards whenever I want to revise them and select any word to see more detail then I can't continue revision where I was.. it has to start from first again
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate has always been my favorite translation app, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to uninstall it. The latest update has been draining my battery at an exponential rate (my phone notifies me of battery draining apps). This is really disappointing because I live abroad and I need the app many times throughout my day."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's an excellent app does exactly what supposed to do however when I came from the United States and to Vietnam my Vietnamese live translation would not work. there is a slash through the icon and says there is no Live translation available for my selected languages. in the USA it worked. I use it on a Samsung Galaxy 9 plus never had a problem with it except the life translation when I got to Vietnam I purchase a Samsung j4 the app crashes constantly. might lower the rating soon.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am amazed from this app. Apart from written translatio it has the feature to vouce transatios from and to virtually all languages. It's dependable, easy to use and does everything plus and extra mike of user friendly interface and I use it regularly and highly recommend to the other users to consider taking the app which will make the translation in a few different ways easy enough for everyone regardless her/his computer knowledge"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Seriously impressive the way it translates text on items and shows you the image with it translated. Even obscuring the old text with the same coloured background so it doesn't distract from the new text. There's been a lot of work out into make this look seamless. Rare that I am motivated to review an app, but this really does Impress me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the last automatic update, it hardly worked. I reinstalled it and then it started working. BUT it's definitely NOT as good as it used to be AND not as comfortable to use as it used to be before this terrible update!!! The worst update ever !!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No stars really. It used to be handy and quick to use as a kind of online dictionary. Now I type in a word I'm looking for and nothing happens. It's like it won't tell me unless I let it speak. Get lost! And it wants me to speak at it. I have never used it that way and never will or use my camera. I do not want these features yet there seems no way to turn them off. Have just uninstalled.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good afternoon. Translator does not work. Always searches for the network, although there is an Internet connection. At the same time, the conversation is translated without problems, but there are always problems with text translation. Repeatedly reinstalled the application and restarted the phone, but the result was negative. Why does this problem occur? And when will you fix it? An email was sent to support, but there was no response."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't work normally. Translations often freeze and cannot be performed. Functions such as image or audio translation still work normally, but text translation does not"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, just downloaded you, but I cant be very objective yet, as the only other online translator I ever used was Quora's; it was okay-ish. Also, you have upgraded a-plenty since the last time i used you regularly in 2021. Gimme a few moments to get used to you again. Then we can talk. Cheers."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ref. Update on 10-may-2022, allows me to copy again the romanized Thai translation. This feature was lost months ago. It's indispensable for learning. Thanks a million. Good work. *** Overall very good... I translated the word UNTIL in 3 different context & got 3 different words. It's not a criticism because I appreciate how difficult the Thai language is. The camera feature is helpful. Thanks for the Great app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the ease of use with this project, but remember, kids, when your teachers say to not type things into Google Translate, they mean it, this application is typically useful for individual words and small phrases, but has a difficult time grabbing onto tenses. Regardless, Google has done a great job improving this app thus far and I hope they continue to do so."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This has been my go to automated translation product ever since it was released. If I remember correctly it was first offered with Spanish, it added one language at a time for a while but now it has close to what would be considered every ""Majorly spoken"" language. The Grammar level and accuracy seems to work at the highest lvl's when typing 1-2 sentence at a time"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wasn't happy when my phone updated and the changes seemed radical. I didn't want to learn how to use it all over again. I'm happy to be wrong. The changes are radical but in a good way. The fonts are easier to read and the transitions are more accurate and dependable. There are still ""Crazy Google"" translations from time to time, but so far they haven't got me in trouble. Thanks, keep up the good work!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The accent of the speaker has changed from American English to British English and does not change in any way, even when I change the region. 😡😡😡 The translation reversal, which used to be done with a symbol, has gone to the menu section, which is more difficult to access.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new design & interface doesn't even deserve a single star. The tap to translate has become even more hectic. It does translate what is copied however it does not switch the language when you press ""new translation"". A year or two ago it did that. It was pretty much game changing back then. Whichever brain was behind this new interface, needs to stop working on it. Must restore the year old version of this app or bring the old features back else I see this app going down."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to work perfectly. Last update ruins the app. Constantly get ""check your connection and try again error"" when I have clear high speed connectivity in place. This bug ruins the whole app *Update, reinstalled, redownloaded all languages. Restarted multiple times. Literally search the internet and thousands of people have this bug and Google doesn't fix it. Still 1 STAR. Terrible application"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google needs to realize that there are multiple countries that speak Spanish and every country has a different name for certain things. They need to have an option for you can put in a suggested name or word depending on the country for the item you're searching for. That's the whole point of Castilian. Every area has their expressions and their names for things around Mexico Central America and South America especially Spain!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love thus app (in Android 9); it was amazing. Last week, I bought an Android 11 phone and the OS changes resulted in this app becoming infuriating. The floating icon is permanent, until explicitly removed. Once removed, it can't be reinstated. Google claims this is due to security-related changes to the OS. It seems to me that someone simply lacked imagination when redesigning the app behaviour. It is now incredibly frustrating to use."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They ruined the tap to translate feature with the latest update. You now have to paste the text into the app everytime you want something translated. The floating icon now always stays on your screen. In the old version it would only appear for a few seconds after you recently copied something. It no longer auto detects the language.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think it's handy sometimes but overall I don't like to use it mainly because of the voiceover as it never let me complete my sentences and cut them half way. It's 2021 and AI is booming but your algorithm is so full of flaws. Consumers don't expect this from Google applications, as you are supposed to have best resources to develop great applications but instead it's just disappointment. There are many other applications in play store which are better than this."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mainly used this for the tap to translate feature, but now the stupid bubble stays on screen all the time! Disabling this until it's fixed. I've read the link mentioned in your response (though you realise we can't tap that link from here? Thanks, memorising that URL was fun) I get the security concern, but let me grant permission for this app in that case? Ultimately I don't really care the reasons, it's made this app pointless, might as well just use it in Chrome"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Almost there, but still needs a little work on to be more intuitive. For example, rather than highlight the text by swiping the screen (for the camera function), why not default the translator function to interpret the entire source?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's too easy to misclick the handwriting mode with your thumb. Then when you try to switch back to keyboard - active window for enter stays on the top of display, but the keyboard appears on the moment and then you got full clear display with small entering window on top, which is very hard to reach especially on long display. Please fix both of this problem, it's very uncomfortable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My first ever review. Made massive mistake updating. Gigantic font size that hurts usability as i need to scroll up to and down for long translations. And gone is the feature to turn your phone sideways and show translated word or sentence to someone to be understood. Or say... Person who cannot hear. Now you just are presented with the same gigantic font to scroll up and down. Useless. And where is my saved phrases and words?! What on earth.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please let the users turn back on the previous version. Google lens is not at all user friendly. It's a real pain to use it and alot of time wastage when translating from image. Previous version was excellent. It allowed to select text of our own choice to translate and no time was wasted in using that. 2. Traditional chinese language is missing from this version. 3. With this version now there's no use of this app while previous version was really useful.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate is awful with Android 10. Having a the constant icon is annoying, especially with the phone wide dark mode. Dragging it to the bottom is not a solution, as that disables the function anyway. Might as well use the main app. If you can't get a security exemption to read the clipboard, l'd suggest changing the notification. Make it display the translation window when pressed. It will be way faster than the icon and the other stuff is not as important as that functionality."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest version features a good visual, but not with its function. I can't translate sentences using wifi, mobile data only. I use WiFi to stream on youtube with HD resolution very smoothly, play music in Spotify, or play games and social media all there are no problems (But Google Translate HAVE A PROBLEM) please, fixed that problem...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hi Google team, the translate app was one of the best apps ever. I used it daily and was super happy with it, until the last few days were it's started to be irresponsive and most of the times when I try to translate a word, I get a message saying ""check your connection and try again"" although my connection would be fine and all other Google services are working properly. Please advise."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use Google Translate all of the time to study Japanese, primarily the handwriting input, and 12-key flick kana input. Although the sentence structure between Japanese and English is completely different, it is surprisingly accurate. Also valuable because it gives the pronunciation (""reading""). Many people say DeepL is better, but it can't be used outline and doesn't give readings."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hello team! I am having a lot of difficulties in using Google's new translator. The new version of Google Translator has become very irritating. Its PopUp button Always is enabled on mobile screen and also show on notifications bar. While earlier on when a text was copied, the popup icon bubble button would go up and translate. which was very easy. Now too much irrating has been done."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was a great app! The user interface allowed me to see the history, so I could jump back and forth so I could type in variants of previous searches without forgetting them. Also I could switch between translations back and forth easier. I already have forgotten a lot of gear features which existed, and it's so much worse.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This used to be in my top 2 apps. I don't know why there's been such a shift but issues with offline translation made me drop a star from the rating. Then the inability to clear translation history removes another. Please fix offline translation where for some bizarre reason it says there is a problem with the connection (defeats the purpose of offline translation). Please add a clear translation history back to the settings menu.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be good. When you copied text the icon would pop up for a 1 click translate. Now it doesn't work and I don't like using it. Too many clicks needed for a simple translate. I see all the other negative reviews here about the update. I will probably look for an alternative. Google if you respond to my review either tell me you are going to sort it out or suggest an alternative that works like the previous version. This will be helpful. Thanks.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Previous version was worlds better, plain and simple. One-touch translation with the floating icon made it extremely easy to have an ongoing text conversation with someone in another language. Now it's four clicks for EVERY MESSAGE THEY SEND. No thanks. How the hell did Google engineers go from one click to four clicks for a process and decide to ship it? Insanity."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rubbish. Since the update on 8th November 2022, translate doesn't work. English to Spanish, type in hello....you get a message saying ""Can not translate. Check connection and try again"" does not make a difference if you are on WiFi or 4g mobile network, with full signal connection and all other apps are connected to the internet, no problem. Google should have this fixed by now, it has been weeks. Before this I would have given 4 or 5 stars but, not at the moment. GOOGLE, FIX THIS NOW."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate feature used to open a bubble icon upon copying a text for an instant translation and then disappear on its own. I loved the way it can instantly translate upon command. Now, this bubble just remains on your screen indefinitely until you manually hide it. After you hide it, it doesn't reappear until you unhide it from your settings. This makes the feature counterproductive and ultimately useless, as it's annoyingly unbearable. Please revert to the automatic hide/reappear !"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to work really good when the floating translation button didn't require me to paste the text every time to translate and just translated whatever I copied automatically. Now I have to clear the previous translation every time and then paste the new copied text to translate. That is very inconvenient as compared to the older versions. Please fix this. Make it seamless.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous version of the app was excellent. So, why the hell did you change it? The Translate bubble would appear when you copied something. It was perfect. A great idea. Now you either have to accept to have it floating permanently - it is always in the way of something - or you have to fumble around when you want to translate something. Who's the genius who came up with that? It is not an improvement. It's a regression. Sometimes it's best to leave things that work well."

Now keyboard used to do hand writing switches to alphabet mode after each kanji. Handwriting tool of UI itself reduced writing surface.

I consider switching to Bing or Yandex for my Japanese translations if this does not get fixed soon."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Google Translate for a long time and I'll have to say the older version was so much better and easier to use. But I'm not even here to complain about how complicated it is to use now, cause I've learnt to use Hi Dictionary to translate in apps and use this for typing. The reason I'm here is to complain about the translation results. Sometimes it translates my text in a very wrong way but the thing that annoys me the most is that the translation results has too much comma symbols."

But every day it gets reset and I can't see my saved phrases without opening the app and going to my saved phrases there. On the widget it's blank and just says ""save key phrases"" even though I have a fair amount saved. Also everyday it asks me to backup my history to my account. I don't know why it asks me everyday and I can't figure out if there's a way to enable the backup automatically."

When I try clicking on the icon, it sends me to the Google play store to download the Google app. The problem is my device is a Android Go device so I can't download it. Please fix and make it native in the app like how it used to be!!! Or at least allow it to redirect to Google go edition!!!!!"

Although I hate the new interface that keeps my history of translations hidden from my 'immediate' access, without a doubt, Google Translate is still a valuable asset for my purposes.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Security update killed the most useful feature of this app, tap to translate. Now the translate feature is a persistent icon ever present, and unhideable. Having a persistently present bubble notification is NOT A FIX. It is at best an annoyance, at worse a hindrance, and is downright in all cases, bad UI design. I get the security risks, but something needs to be done to mimic previous functionality as best as possible such as using gestures to summon the app when needed, not a lazy work around"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great app, but now has major problems. Using it on Android 9, sound clips cut out prematurely. Whether using A9 or 10, the app is now very slow to download these audio clips, regardless of whether WiFi or data is used. Pasted text doesn't display. More importantly, the Tap-to-Translate feature is screwed up in A10: the translate icon needs to constantly display. Instead of fixing this problem affecting all A10 users, Google provides cookie-cutter referrals to a useless URL."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: I already know how to drag the bubble. I want it to appear every time I copy something like the older versions. ____ Please bring switching languages in the Floating Window Translate Menu back. Also it would be so good if the floating icon appears just after when I copy something. The floating icon shouldn't appear always when I turn it on. It should be on screen whenever I copy something. Please bring that feature back too!

It was perfect with just one touch and since I updated it the translation icon does not longer leave my screen which is very annoying because I do tend to touch when I'm doing something else and if I remove it, I will have to go activate before it starts working again and the icon just remain they.

But I learnt that I can translate by highlighting the word/s and the option to translate will shows (but I have to copy the words to the writing section). if it not shows on the left side of the ""copy bar"" you might need to press the 3 dots. I learnt it after I reinstalled the app. don't know if that's possible before or without reinstalling it. Hope a better way soon."

There is not clear way to open the translation details.. the ui is so minimalist that you would expect it to somehow naturally gives what you want but it does not. Edit: Also i am surprised that the reverse translation button is hidden in the three dots menu, thats one of the main features i personally use while translating. Probably it should be more prominent, not only when kbrd open"

Wish I could downgrade the app. Please see the latest reviews , no one liked the new method you'd though might be better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Last update rubbish. The app is not needed to be in all my screens all the time. It only need to pop up as it used to and disapear once translations was seen or after few moments if the copying text was not even meant for translation purposes. It is now constantly open affecting usage of other apps and interfering. So to avoid it it has to be forced to stay closed and the pop up would then not work. No middle ground. Rubbish. Having now to exit what doing to go to the app for translation.

If one turns off the radios you get ""this feature is unavailable offline"" for voice translation however with radios on and no service it will occasionally display a warning message to the effect of, this translation was done offline so it's definitely possible for it to voice offline, it simply doesn't let you deliberately not send yourself to google"

I feel like the quality of Google Translate overall varies depending on what you're using. Using the website on my laptop is by far the best way to look things up, with this app being a close second. I do mainly use it for Japanese, though, and I do find that there are a lot of problems with it. But it has gotten much better over the years! Keep it up and I might raise it to a 5."

So, please fix it, because I find it the most helpful option in this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The GUI of the app is so NOT user friendly. It's not convenient to work with and you can not easily edith the text (as the translated text will appear in front of it and you just see one line of the original text.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new layout made things more complicated as other reviewers have mentioned. It's faster and easier to search for your translation on a web browser and switch languages or reverse languages. Uninstalling this app until the layout is updated or reverted back to the old efficient layout. (Don't fix it if it's not broken)

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Consistently gets worse with every update. With japanese it is now getting basic hiragana wrong and inventing sounds that dont even exist in Japanese (ti and tu for example. Should be chi and tsu. It sometimes it says txu for tsu). It often gives several different translations for the same word when searched more than once. Offline doesnt work at all. Nothing happens. Roumaji doesnt work and it suggests other languages instead. Becoming unusable.

Without giving the translator the context, you will most likely get a really really bad translation. History with very selective memory. Remember weeks old translations, but the last 2 days translations are gone. Why can't you test your updates before releasing them?

A super typical way to avoid hearing users. Do you have a problem to communicate internally? There's no option to select a voice based on your gender. It speaks with female voice only. If you're male and you use Google translate it speaks with female voice for your translation and it's totally weird."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works very well for sign translation. Conversation mode is acceptable for common western languages, e.g., French, German, Spanish, Italian. Less acceptable for Asian languages. Japanese is usable but only about 65-75% accurate, Chinese is marginal.

By the way, it's my second review of the app. The previous one has disappeared by some unclear reason. Google Maps is now a glitchy trash, and that's all in the past few years. Before, the Google apps helped me a lot when I was abroad. Now I only get some unclear updates and often Google Terms re-admission requests, without which I cannot use even the Ggl Play. What's going on with Google?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The export to a Google spreadsheet of favorite translated words leaves many words missing behind which is very annoying.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline."

The app will change your messages until what you said has been changed completely and the communication has offended the other party. I have learned this through experience. I have even considered learning the language instead of using such an unreliable piece of shovelware but have been unable due to the lack of online offerings and unavailable classes in my proximity. I feel like a hostage to this app until I learn the language. Terrible.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before latest update it was very good Now cannot save translation and the save function doesn't work , new format not as good as before , annoying having to go to settings to search history , before you can just scroll from previous translation list underneath to find your previous translation ,can delete ones you don't need so you have a list of translation that you use often . Some Chinese to English translation has changed and is not correct . By recommendation now use Microsoft translate"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is very harsh updated version app. Previous version is much better then this one. One more issue, previously we are allowed to use offline version but in latest version we are not allowed to use it. I don't have any problem with interface. Might be UI/UX dev is trying to do something new experimentally 🤔. But why you removed offline features 😕. Bring it back please."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In newer versions, Google violates their own design guidelines. Notifications are supposed to be timely and relevant. However Google has removed the feature where copying foreign text shows you a translation. Instead now you have to accept a permanent floating icon forever and tap that. For reading a long Kindle book in a foreign language I now have to do one hundred extra taps I didn't before, and when not reading I have to put up with this ugly floating icon. Going to search for old versions"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Latest update forces a persistent notification when Tap to Translate is on. No way to fully get rid of it anymore. You can minimize notifications for it, and that removes the icon from the notification shade, but when you pull down the notification shade, there's still a notification that Tap to Translate is on. Fail."

The first one was doing well than this much option over option to the fact that before you get your friends one word translated it might cost almost uncomfortable minutes not even a second.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It translates okay for most simple grammar and sentences, although it completely lacks contextual understanding, nuance, and what a person means versus what they wrote. On the other hand, ChatGPT seems to be able to translate with both context and nuance, not to mention it's been correct when Google Translate spits out some answer from the far left field. Hopefully Google Translate can learn something from ChatGPT."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Feb 2022 update removed autohide from the floating overlay icon, which means I have to permanently hide it. So basically it lost important functionality that made it easier to translate text contextually when I copied text. Edit: contrary to the Google reply, there is no way to hide the tap to translate icon, it permanently floats over all other apps and does not auto hide, and is therefore worse than useless as it obstructs other apps even when not needed."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app has a great interface and the number of languages available is impressive, but there is something that could really help people learning with the app. The application could also have variations in ways of speaking, for example when the word is spoken faster or slower, this would help a lot for fluents, whatever the language. My suggestion is to add a button to control the voice synthesis speed. Thank you for allowing me give one feedback."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is incredibly unwieldy if you want to edit whatever text you might have copied and pasted into it. It only displays a ridiculously narrow edit bar, while the rest of the screen is unused. Older versions that I used to use didn't have this issue and this poor edit functionality really breaks my experience using it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The GUI of the update is horrendous. Every advantage of the older version is functionality worse. If I want to write a character from another language it takes 2 or 3 keystrokes more when before it was one. I can't write in slip screen anymore! Everything is so big. Tap to translate is broken. Please just let me go back and no more updates.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As other reviews have said, recent updates have crippled this app. No longer able to live translate from camera, or use split screen or use offline. Why u do this? Just leave it be and keep your text translation monopoly. Your reply contains a link with outdated information. The app offloads camera translation to Google Lens which cannot live translate - you have to capture photos and upload for results. It is frustrating that you engineer this amazing software experience only to kill it off."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Tap to Translate"" is not working properly. Previously it translates a copied word with a tap in floating icon. But now it has to paste the copied word separately in the floating icon to translate. Previous version was way better. Update - 30.6.2022 Same problem again. Tap to translate is not showing the option in which you can just tap the icon and translate. Now you have to clear the field and paste everything to get the translation."

While play is a universal language (they can play together for hours with talking) this app has really came in handy for when we do need to communicate with her friend or her family. It misfires every now and then, but that's to be expected because of different dialects and accents, but as a whole it works great!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I want it to show the translation back to English first. I always copy the output, swap the languages around, then paste the output into the input to see just how wrong the sentence is. Would be good if this was built in.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super! Like the new UI! For those who suffer so much: just take one minute and learn the damn interface. It became more convenient to use, the buttons are bigger, the text is larger, synonyms are clickable now and the UI looks nice. Few wishes to the devs: place X button above the language chooser, add Paste button on the plain field (so we don't need to click on the screen to get it) and add the reverse button on the final translation screen so there is no need to go to the drop-down menu."

Besides that, it would be 4 stars."

Now i have to remove everything and copy paste everything. This version shouldnt be released at all"

Therefore the impact of speech tools is disproportionally higher. AI can make anything, this cant be that hard to do.

Now the Thai keyboard button has disappeared and been replaced by one for adding a GIF!!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was enjoying the app up until recent app updates. What happened to UX? In the latest versions, when I do a context switch between Google Translate and other apps sometimes the ""Enter text"" area becomes unclickable until full(kill the app) app restart. This is really frustrating and wasn't an issue in previous versions of the app. I know the team is doing the great job, but I couldn't find any other way to report this bug."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2022 pointless redesign reduced usability just to match some global brand aesthetic. Tap to Translate in particular was totally screwed (way more cumbersome to use, wasted screen state, two buttons which do the same...). I would like to hear an explanation from your UX team to justify these changes, because it doesn't make sense to me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,There are some apps available now having voice translation with good accuracy. I wonder why Google translate is lagging behind. It should develop voice translation over you tube videos so that we can understand them. Also 100 language pack is not a necessary one. A person is going to use only three or four language. Let him select and keep it permanently. We are ready to pay for that. Kindly consider.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate the new update to the camera feature. I don't want it to automatically overwrite the words. I hate that I have to switch it off manually every time. And I ahte how many extra steps you added to get the text back to the translate app. I usually use the app to get the readings of kanji rather than a translation and this update made it so much harder. I will consider alternatives
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is one of my most used apps, and one of the most useful and life changing, but the UI of this app is one of the worst of all of Google's apps. For some reason, everything takes about four times as many taps as necessary and you can't easily edit the input to be translated because the UI changes to have a ridiculously large font size with a line height of less than one. At least respect system font size settings and don't make every state change cause the layout to change. The developer response to this is another example of the team working on this app making users do too much work. How hard is it to communicate within your team about the problems users are having with the app rather than making me waste my time finding some other form to fill out just to tell you that I'm unsatisfied?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's already translating on websites, I think it's good enough to be integrated into Google Meet and other supported apps as an utility. It would be great if this app instantly translates the user's voice or the captions and also the text messages in the chat, BOTH INTO THE INDIVIDUAL USER'S PRE-SELECTED LANGUAGE IN REAL-TIME DURING A VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL!!! This app has a great potential to break all language barriers and that is a great feat to accomplish on a global scale. 🙏 make it free 🥺"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, incredibly useful. I am fluent in both English and Spanish and the translations are on spot on both languages.

Wonder, useful app."

It is best when i have to translate hindi to English. The history of sentences or words is shown below and that was very convenient to check whenever I want. But now I'm upset because you have created a new version and it's totally different from the previous version. I just want the previous version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm shocked that Google came up with such a mediocre redesign. The font IS TOO BIG and it becomes unergonomic to scroll through the original texts to come to the translated ones and not to mention that it is harder to compare texts, while there is no option to rescale. I'd like to save my thumbs, not making it worse. Your devs got paid big bucks but they lose common sense."

Recently, I encountered a bug where, from time to time, when I tap on Enter Text the keyboard will not display. The only solution is to force stop the app and restart it. While this is certainly an annoyance, it is not a show-stopper, but I do hope it will be remedied at some point soon. Other than that, it's a great app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Of course this is a great application! However there is something which is missing for me and probably a lot other people who are hard of hearing. It would have been very helpful for me if the app had IPA transcription so people who cannot hear properly but could still speak to be able to read how words are correctly to be pronunciated. Life is easy for people without disabilities but the others needs extra consideration.... Please make it easier for everyone!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Leave it to Google to make apps worse with each update. The app was more than stellar in the previous updates with the highlighter translator. Now it's a dumpster fire of garbage with it's Google lens. No one wants to use that garbage because it doesn't work half the time. Literally omits the words I'm trying to translate. What happened to writing?? That disappeared too. Absolutely ridiculous.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app but it replaces some words during translation that gives the sentence a completely different meaning sometimes for example ""while"" gets turned to ""as"" in spanish translation . It also gets confused translating words like "" Push or Pull, or Poke atleast in spanish translations. Also it has huge impact on battery life ( The Tap to translate is good but drains battery if left on)"

Here is the case, the bubble will disappear after pop up translating words, which force me to open this app and then switch back to continue to use the bubble.

For assisting me with communicating in Spanish, it has been my ""be all"". HOWEVER, just in the past couple days, Google Translate will ONLY open in the Conversation mode. The primary Google Translate format cannot be accessed. I have deleted and reinstalled Google Translate numerous times. After installation and when I open Google Translate while on the Play Store page, it will open to the primary format. However, once I close the app and open it again, it opens to the Conversation mode screen. I have cleared the Google Translate and Google Play Services cache. I've don a petition wipe; and so far nothing has changed. If I want to use Google Translate in its primary mode, I have to access through my Chrome browser in order to be able to have speech input. Although I have loved using the Google Translate and it has helped me so immensely in my efforts to learn to speak, write and read Spanish, now I am absolutely bewildered over this development. Also, I unfortunately don't have much hope of even being able to get any support that might resolve this issue. So, I am going to sadly give Google Translate a 2 Star rating. Of course, if there is a resolution to my problem, be assured that I will review Google Translate again!"

It takes 8-10x longer to translate a text now, it does not automatically pull the text to the tap to translate, it does not detect the language, You must select the language you want it translated to on every translation, it is horrible now. Please change it back or I see many people looking for alternatives, and if I can find an app that does what Google translate used to do, I will go to it also."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What happened to copy a text and the bubble automatically shows up? Now the UI is trash and what seem to be a one click translate now takes you to several annoying clicks before translate. The worse part is that google even made it impossible to install older version from other source. This is exactly why I hate turning on my auto update because you tend to receive trash. I really wish I can give zero ⭐
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is an excellent translator app it can allow an icon to just draw over all your other apps and just kind of be there all the time so that if you want something on the page translated all you have to do is click on the little thing at the top and that is awesome the translations are also very accurate at least in English and Spanish on those are the only ones I could review because there's only ones I've used but they're very accurate

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did you feel the need to use Lens & make the app so horribly unusable? Can't select particular sections now, have to select the original lang over directly, clunkily, WRONGLY translated sentences manually EVERYTIME, can't highlight sentences anymore, popups everywhere, can't see words, can't select original sentence easily anymore, UNUSABLE. What took 3s earlier now takes 10min to do 🤦‍♀️. Is this really your idea of ""improvement""? Pls give back the old interface. It worked, unlike this one"

I have been using it for the last two years. it is very easy to use , the translation system, choice of options, spekar & quality so Wonderful. But now it's not working well speaker, translation is very poor . Everything is very bad. Please change it.old version is very good new version not good"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Practically useless. I used this app for 5 years to translate written Japanese content such as product labels and use instructions on the fly with its instant translate option. Sure the translations weren't great but it was enough to get the job done. Now all of a sudden the instant translate is gone and there is a non-functioning Google lens option that just sits there ""looking for results..."". It doesn't translate anything on the picture, just sits there. I even downloaded the language pack."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great program.. Now they insist on being front and center above every app. With the tap to translate button... Tap to translate . Was awesome. Now it frustrating.. Always getting in the way of my texting communications... Some ""genius Millennial"" at Google thought it would be a great idea to take over the screen the entire time you text people from other countries... It's stupid.. And frustrating. And yes I know you can disable it.. But is no longer worth the frustration"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Best resource for translating a few languages. Fantastic catalogue of vocabulary for most of the languages it has. I love the tap to translate feature. I'm gonna keep it at 3 stars till I can have more than 5 languages in recent languages. (8 would probably be ideal, but I'd settle for 7 and even 6 would be better than 5. 10 might be nice or it might be overwhelming, I'm not sure.) Or maybe have a setting where you can choose how many languages to keep in recent languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update sucks!!!! The new look is good but all the good functionality is gone! Now the tap to translate is not working properly, it either show on top always or not, which used to show automatically only when i copy a text which is very useful back then. Not only that but now u need to manually 1) tap to start 2) clear old text 3) paste the new one 4)tap again to translate compared to just tap the newly appeared floating icon and thats it! I don't know how google do such messy update!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really enjoy Google Translate. The camera portion was great, as it had a highlight function and would let you pick out individual words (like an OCR). After the most recent update, it auto-translates an entire photo and you cannot select individual text. I really don't like this update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"GT is great app! It is about ""Tap to Translate"" (""TtT""). Dear developers could you add options: 1) selector for hiding Setting icon in the window ""TtT"", I often tap on Setting instead Voice speaking icon - this is problem for male's fingers. we can do setting in main app. 2) selector for switch on automatically Voice speaking for ""TtT"". new word has a new meaning and + new pronunciation 3) selector for switch on to show Definitions first. In main app selector Definitions first Translation second"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was a great app! But the last UI update kill it. I cannot use the app anymore. My phone has an English as a primary language, but this is not my native language. And also I am studying English. When I select some words in a book or a website and use Translate button, Google Translate app translate it from English to English. And most ugly UX is the app hasn't language selector on screen with translated word. This is very stupid!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This used to be a great app to use but ever since its update it has become terrible. When you used the Detect Language option it will not read the original text. It used to be able to. It also can no longer translate from the floating window. I hv to go to the main app to input for translation. It's so inconvenience. Why r u making thing worse?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Read recent reviews—did Google do ANY user testing before releasing the new UI? The new interface is a complete failure. They've made it LESS efficient, LESS intuitive, LESS useful. Form follows FUNCTION; or at least it should. Please revert to the old UI, or make it an option. It's now difficult to use this app for anything other than simple words or a single sentence. And you have to scroll to find most recent history at the BOTTOM? Absurd. Searching for new app to replace this. Epic fail."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Actually the best dictionary app inside playstore. The problem is that offline dictionary results are too brief. There's huge difference between online results and offline results.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app seems to work as far as I can tell, I don't speak Spanish so I'm not sure how well it works. However this app took my keyboard from my phone and it really screwed me up. I have to think that if Google takes your keyboard off your phone when you download this app, are they really translating correctly? Explanation: since I downloaded this app, my keyboard disappeared and sometimes it would be on my screen and if it was, I could only use about half of it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After update copy text doesn't send and open the floating icon as before, so annoying. From setting Show Floating Icon, keep the icon always on screen, if you hid it you need reactivate from setting again. In addition even if it's on, the copied text doesn't send, you need still to paste it. Before , all it was needed is to copy then the floating icon show and copied text is send without need to paste. Very strange that developer don't test, or do bad development."

As soon as id copy something the bubble would appear on the corner for me to tap it and translate if i wanted to, if i didnt tap it for 2-3 sec it would dissappear, just perfect ! WHAT HAPPENED NOW on 11??!! Why it doesnt appear at all when i copy something??? And why doesnt it go away when i manually activate it??? Is this some kind of failed joke ? Both situations when it would be useful in both situations fails so badly wow....."

Please add these features, it will make your app more attractive and more useable for us. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When are you going to support the freaking dark mode for translate?? I mean, it's been awhile since you provided dark mode for the iOS version, but why don't on your own Android OS? Is it that hard? Not only that, Tap to translate also stopped working after updating to Android 10. It was one of the key features that made this app useful, so yall gotta do something with it asap."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app has changed for the worse. Doesn't detect the correct language. Need to get translations correct. When you use a picture to translate and then use the same picture again and get a totally different translation, then you know something isn't right. Filipino and tagalog are 2 different languages so you need to have both languages to download. I think Google Translate needs to use Google"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I call it ""Giggle translate"" because some of the translations are funny!! But improving all the time. I have been able use it to arrange meetings in different languages so it is great. (I wish though that they had the pronunciation for ALL languages, but at least i can get my message across.) Thanks Google!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is absolute rubbish now. I used to love it and find it really helpful but it just stopped working. It just won't actually translate anything. It seems to be stuck on the 'loading' circle and nothing ever happens! I just uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it but the new one is doing tje same thing. What a load of rubbish. Not happy. I'll have to get some other generic one. Screw you Google!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Translate To is changing? I use this app to translate selected English words on book reader screen to Russian. After resent update the app keeps translating to Serbian by default. I need to re-select Russian language from drop-down menu for each translation. Very inconvenient. I guess most recent languages From/To not saving correctly. Google, what's going on? Confused Galaxy S8 user."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was a great app but in the last few updates the photo translate gives the wrong, partial or messed up translations. Most of the time it gives weirdly worded English translations. Especially Chinese & Korean. I don't speak or read either language so I'm relying on the app to translate for me but now I've got to try to figure out the weird English translations it's giving me from those 2 languages. I updated to the new version & it's even worse than before so I uninstalled it. Please fix it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I also never leave reviews and I appreciate that its being improved. But this latest update is so user unfriendly for my use case. The first thing that jumps out at me is the huge, giant font. It is not adjustable. I am not using this to have conversations with people where I share my screen. The release notes say ""Bug fixes and improvements"". This is completely redesigned. I use this app daily and the latest version feels much less functional. I love this app, but please, you broke it 🥺"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the original scan functionality was replaced with Google lens, it is much less useful. The more they try to consolidate the camera /OCR related feature into Google lens, the more clunky and eventually completely unusable this app will become. This is because unbeknownst to them, the translation results differ for lens even with the exact same text, and is usually far worse on lens, not to mention the UI doesn't allow selective partial translations to bias the AI if its getting things wrong"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate was always 5 stars in my mind until today when I saw that the scan (take a picture of words, scan to select words, and translate) function was removed. It was the best part about it since the immediate translation function is unusable considering if you wobbled your hand for even just a second the words would scatter. Please bring it back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually installed this app for my mandarin subject and I want to learn korean. I'm expecting so much in this app. But sometimes, when translating a sentence, the grammars are off. It translates indirectly. But so far, I just want to learn some vocabulary of Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Spanish and I like to learn European language. And so far, it's still good. 👍👍"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Garbage since the new update. The app used to be amazing with texting services and general translating. Could translate back and forth between languages with a simple button. Now its sluggish and too slow to operate. You have to reopen a new window and reselect languages back and forth. Whoever designed the new update should resign and give up their stock shares. Its an embarassment of an app now.

PLEASE IT IS URGENT TO BRING BACK THE PREVIOUS VERSION CONVENIENCE!! I just came back to mention that the double copy and paste is the most awful thing that could be brought back. Y the developers... The auto pop up translation was a 6 stars quality app function. 5 months after nothing changed. Disappointed 😞"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"User Interface is bad now for drawing Japanese Kanji. As of this writing, UI in screenshots in store, match an older version that worked great for this. The writing area was stretched to use most of the screen, and you could see suggestions on top. Now app relies on keyboard installed (app uses exact size as drawing area). If you want a bigger area, install a keyboard that can be resized, then resize everytime you need to draw. Gboard by Google can't be resized, so I had to install competition."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was a great app, but after they patched in the new update, the bubble head never goes off the screen. You have to switch off the feature completely for the bubble to go. So inconvenient when having to constantly switching on and off the setting instead of highlighting and a popup appears at the top of the screen."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I downgraded my vote due to the tap to translate function is not working anymore in Android 10, I do not care if any other app can watch the clipboard (that was the excuse) it is better than just google: Add a permission for that as denied by default and let the user decides which app can access it, but no let's remove it and do not offer any alternative option. In chrome you can translate from contextual menu after a long press but is located in the last option is not intuitive and more steps."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The old version was more helpful. It gave more possible suggestions. The new version gives one translation that it thinks is the best with no possibility to search for other translations like before. This version should be rolled back. I am using other apps for translations now because translate just isn't useful enough anymore. Sure there is the camera feature. But for language learning that does nor always help.

If I don't log in, I can't use the image translation. What the heck? It didn't happened in old UI and functionality. When using the voice or typing translation, I can choose not using my google account, so why the image translation FORCE IT to log in? It's too instrusive! I like the old UI and functionality because it respect the anonimity principle."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good and fast translation unlike others asking to register and pay monthly contribution bla bla. Problem to this app, it doesn't look professional by format. I get to see translation letters but not a sheet with the translation. Must say this kind of App should be available to everyone, all over the world. Brings the world easier and together. Would give 5 stars if visually looks better as/in a sheet with possibility of Editing, add words or comment and place picture and signature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app until the most recent update. Now the floating icon is always visible and I have to re-enable it whenever I want to use it, rather than it popping up automatically when you copy text, like it used to. It's not even convenient for me to use anymore, since I can copy text and have it translated in just as many steps in the normal method. Fix this, please! This used to make my life so much easier as I frequently switch between two languages on my phone."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,* this feedback has been deleted (2) time * the latest update removed the useful feature to capture and translate the copied text directly from background. this feature is now gone and now has been replaced with always-on floating icon. however you still need to paste the copied text into the app. this is very annoying and so unproductive especially when you need to keep translating many text from browser and messaging app. i have no idea why google decided to go backwards
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The translated text size needs to remain larger the way it was before the update. Very disappointed with the way the text shrinks down.

This new updates feature enhancements to the camera are excellent! Not only did they fix the previous versions bugs they've made the new versions camera interface an absolute pleasure to use! I was shocked at how quick and easy it is now. Well done Google. This is fantastic.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I so wanted this app to work but it just doesn't. The ""tap to translate"" feature works about 10% of the time, the rest of the time I'm toggling between apps and copying and pasting as with any other translating app. This app has slowed my work flow down because I'm wasting all my time trying to get this app to work instead of working on my languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the update and new format, this app has a bug with the sound! I cannot hear the translation even when the volume on my phn is turned up to the max., so I have to continually uninstall and reinstall to resolve it temporarily to listen to the pronunciations of the words. Please fix this bug, the sound worked perfectly fine before the update!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible experiences after the new interface * Extremely hard to use tap to translate feature! Better u should avoid that feature! No use at all * translator works slow and needs extra 3-4 steps to complete a translation! Before it was just copy text it'll be translated! This updation is like modern era to stone age like! Better bring back the older version that we where using last 4 years!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,In (2020)It's a good and nice application to get translations and translations conversations. But it will be good if they installed more main languages of world in conversation section. In (2022)Now this new updated version is not freindly as previous version because for seeing History whenever clicking on back option it's taking directly to home page for translating new words instead of taking back to (history) words.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very reliable and convenient when writing or reading text(s)/material(s). Great features for quick auxiliary help/learning and such across apps...

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Agree with Dewald Botha. Image translate is reorienting imported images 90°. In other words, images appear on their side. Very inconvenient. Also, where is the ""suggest another translation"" option, to help you improve translations? Even simple words do not show, what should be standard additional translations, such as Congratulations in Spanish. You offer Felicidades as the only option when Enhorabuena should also be offered. Enhorabuena does register to Congratulations in English just fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never realised quite how inaccurate this tool can be until just now. A failing which is made all the more worse by the fact that suggestions for better translations cannot be made in the app. Edit: I thought I might respond to the response below.

The user journey here is as clear as mud."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: I already know how to drag the bubble. I want it to appear every time i copy something like the older versions. ____ Please bring switching languages in the Floating Window Translate Menu back. Also it would be so good if the floating icon appears just after when I copy something. The floating icon shouldn't appear always when I turn it on. It should be on screen whenever I copy something. Please bring that feature back too!

After restart here is yet another thing that I was presented with, I must give permission to the very application that is requiring me to give permission for the floating icon. I can code better"

Super annoying."

I used to just hit copy of anything i needed translating and it would give the bubble with it already translated and i could press new reply. Now, the bubble doesnt come up and i have to copy everything manually. You ruined it. Totally messed it up. Its not even a nicer look. Totally made it a nightmare and so slow. Its horrible. It was great b4"

You have to run your finger over every word 3) theres no option to back to the photo and highlight particular words for translation after you click on a particular set of words you want translates, the photo is lost and you have to start again.

At first it detecte the words good but when it's going to finish, the translate change the mean to something completely out of sense and the writing translate is good. but it's not useful for get correct grammar or some similar it's just a simple translate word to word"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This can be very useful in unexpected situations. For instance my partner was injured abroad and I needed to communicate with hospital staff who spoke little English. It copes in situations where sign language or miming is not viable. Save the language offline and you don't even need WiFi or mobile data, which can be problematic in hospitals."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unhappy with changes to the handwriting functionality. If you have an existing translation and you want to add to it, you can no longer directly handwrite. Unclear if this is a bug. You added 2 additional clicks because now you have to click the field, the keyboard pops up, then you click the icon to change from keyboard to handwriting, then the handwriting prompt pops up. You used to be able to get to the handwriting prompt directly from the main translation page. 1 star for exposure, loved the app otherwise, please revert this change! *****edit: to respond to dev, Yes the handwriting and microphone are on the right when the ""tap to enter text"" is BLANK. But if it already has words and I want to ADD MORE WORDS, I can't handwrite. I have to click into it, then change from keyboard to handwriting. You used to be able to append directly via handwrite."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate already has a lot of progress. But it would be even better if you restore the translation icon feature that automatically appears on the screen after copying the text. In my opinion, that's more practical, than having to repeatedly swipe down the notification bar. Please fix it. Thank you."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Still no audio of Russian translations. it really helps the learning curve if you can hear what a language is supposed to sound like instead of just (A) Pointing at your phone's screen, (B) Try your best to sound out a totally unfamiliar language without sounding like you are strangling. Had translate on my old S4 and it had audio for Russian."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is absolutely fine for translating but the major issue I have with the application is that its very limited on what it does. It should show sentences to show examples on how the word would fit in everyday conversations because this would depend on the context of the word that has been used within the sentence because translate only uses the first word that would normally translate from English. So hopefully this major issue would be fixed cause this would be emensley helpful when flying overseas. So hopefully this issue will be fixed.

It would pop up with both languages and you can type and see what you translate real time. This update now you can't even see another language. It goes to an empty box.

All I needed to do was click on the camera function then once text lines up I click scan (best one for Chinese), I then highlight the text I want and wait for translation to appear at the top of the page... Presto, I can follow the instructions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Dear Google translate app devs, your app is on the whole, good, but why did you remove the function to note down everything that you are highlighting in the ""scan"" function of the camera in the history so I am able to refer to it when I exit the camera mode. Now every time I want to check the pronunciation for a word, I have to do it one by one. Please reinstate this functionality which would make people's lives much more convenient like before. Once you've done so I will change my rating."

For example, I tried with many words such Primary and it translates it into Hello Mario!!

I have installed three languages, but it doesn't work, unlike Microsoft App. Hope you fix it. Regards,"

Now after switching to an S20+, the tap to translate bubble seems to require being permanently on the screen.

Oh god ...just when I needed my life to be less complicated"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As regards the Japanese language, Google Translate has improved significantly over the past year. Vocabulary has improved and translations have become more accurate. For reasons I cannot fathom, they are still inserting personal pronouns where they don't belong. I'll say it again, the Japanese only very rarely use personal pronouns and inserting or redacting them creates ample opporunity for misundetstanding. Also, tap to translate still is not working on any of my Samsung devices."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As I say about all Google products, Google Translate is easy to use, does not contain ads, and is extremely helpful. It's free and easy to use. I do have one complaint. There is an option to take a picture of something and it will translate the text. This is an amazing feature, but the camera doesn't pick up on words very well. I am sure that it was hard to design this feature, and I am extremely grateful for it, but in the future, I would like to see it pick up on text better. Thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before the August 1st update it didn't work either. My landlord who speaks very little English cannot understand what it is saying. And the offline translation goes away as well. I tried unistalling the app and did the exact same thing as before! I'm keeping it, but only as a back up. There are a lot of glitches in it that need to go. In my opinion, the program needs to be rewritten entirely with a new one. And get rid of this one."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New layout/UI is downright awful. Why change what was already good? Functions remain mostly the same, but the new UI obscures and hinders the fast and easy use that the old UI had. Also as far as I can tell, 'previous translations' (as in words or phrases you have translated before) have been removed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a long. But now its latest version is worst, it has many bugs. Like it doesn't show latest translation in history. And new layout is very annoying. Old version was super. there was no need to change its layout and other options. Please get us old version back. Whenever its old version is back, l'll definitely give it 5 stars. Hope you'll take this feedback positively. Thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have a suggestion for improving the ""tap to translate"" feature. it would be awesome if I could see the definition of words and not just a one-word-translation.

I've been using for years and now with the update voice its set up for conversations and constantly tries to record. You can't just translate one phrase without having to stop recording and no ability to shut off history so that takes up entire screen.. they just took the best translator around and turned it into complete garbage!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall very useful translator, haven't run on any issues so far. A desirable feature would be to have a list of favourites, it gets tedious to have to search through the languages list when the one you are looking for is not in the recently used ones."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They made it unusable. I used to use this every day as I work on a border. It used to be very easy to use and had all of the features for making my work day easy. Google have totally changed the app and it is now totally unusable. To the point where I no longer use it at all. I used to be able to quickly change between languages whilst having a conversation. This is weird as Google are known for innovation. Sack the person who greenlighted these changes and change it back.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I decided to edit my review to be more specific instead of just complaining. Here is why this update has made the app useless. 1. It used to be that once you copy text you would click on the floating icon and the copied text is already there and translated. If for example you copied spanish it would know its spanish and automatically translate to English. No further steps. Now you need to copy. Open the floating icon. Paste the text in. Chose the language to translate from and to and click agai
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I enjoyed this app until the most recent update that I now regret installing. The tap to translate option used to only pop up whenever I initiated a copy text function but now I have to manually turn the tap to translate function on and off each time otherwise the tap button will float on my screen perpetually. Please revert back to the previous mode or correct this function.

And then when I click new translation, it translates from English to the detected language. 4. I copy the translated text 5. I paced the translated text into message to be sent"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's going on with your app.. The old version was so much more easier to use... Why did you deactivate the button to reverse the translated text and vice versa? I Can't recheck if the translated text makes sense double checking it, now I have to copy the translation, change the language and paste it to do the same action the old version had.. Also why did you include so much space for text and why increased the text size so so much? Please bring the old version back"

Inputting Latin, Russian, Greek etc just gives the input text as output everytime. It does however work if I use the web version so the problem is in the app itself, not the service. So basically, it is useless. Uninstalling and going to use Microsoft Translator instead."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually quite good. But for many weeks now the offline translation comes up with an error, that I could not connect. And yes there is a topic open in the forum, but they don't seem to come up with a fix Update: the developers contacted me, that is a plus. The suggestion is to switch on airplane mode. Then it works. But this can only be a workaround not a solution"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Image translation in the iphone app is much better in the last year or so. Take a picture and the translation will be overlayed on the image.

Why you have removed it?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works great for in-app translations and translating copied text but the constant downtime and inability to translate on the go with google keyboard really sucks. Its more than frustrating when you have a solid 500mbps connection yet translate just has ""connection problems"" whats the issue?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Offline dictionaries got deleted without notifications. You discover it when you desperately need it and no internet connection.

After reinstated offline dictionaries are not working in applications overlay.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was worlds better last year before the update messed with the user interface, made it much harder to use. Legacy option for the UI would be wonderful. It's almost unusable and I use this for work. Also the romanji translation now does some weird 'interpretive spelling' instead of actually just translating like it used to. What would be spelt 'furi' is now 'huri' which is very annoying. I can live with that, but the UI. Who thought this change was a good idea?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good enough to translate intermediate level sentences. I love the camera and handwriting features and what you've done to them in recent updates.

The picture is high enough res just annoying sometimes
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Starfleet worthy app...but its annoying how the new update assumes you are trying to use your native language instead of the language you were trying to translate, though this seems somewhat fixed except with Gboard. Though they have improved the ability to isolate words and give you multiple choices away from the AIs wildly inaccurate interpretation which translates certain languages, specifically Japanese, so bad it's embarrassing, words that share kanji are still inaccurate when spoken."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works fine, but I don't know why developers removed the option to add, from users, better translations. For example: ""hold fast"", presented as: ""A firm grip"", should've been translated to Spanish as: ""Aferrarse"", instead it was translated a: ""Agárrate fuerte"", which is a inadequate and a very simplistic and poor translation. So, please put back the option to send you better translations. With this, Google has moved several steps back."

Some Pali phonetics are hard to figure out just by trying to read. It would mean a lot of this could be fixed on Google translate. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Russian/English is my need; it's very good! Where there are several uses for the same word (ex; earth), one cannot copy & paste anything but the one Translate picks. There needs to be more flexibility. Otherwise, it's darn good!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately since one of the last updates it requires to have the Google app installed to use the camera function. Previously it worked perfectly fine without it. [edit after the Google reply] Hi Google, thank you for the clarification. Unfortunately I'm not interested in having the Google app or Lenses app installed. Before it was possible to do everything from inside Translate without depending on external apps, and that is how I think it should be. I'm going to revert to a precious version"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to have the note 8 and I loved how the floating google icon worked it only popped up when I needed to copy and paste text I have a note 9 now and the floating icon stays on top and gets in the way too much and I have to keep it turned off ...I don't know if that can be fixed but Google if you read this please try to fix that. Make it where the floating icon only pop up when you need to copy or paste and translate does not get in the way of other apps
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be good. Update has ruined!!! Note to everyone: please leave feedback so that developers will see what has been done!!!! A unique, functional, useful app has been turned into a status quo, dysfunctional and practically useless app. I mean, it translates, but plenty of other apps do the same and offer better accuracy as well. Note to Google: I have left multipe feedback messages. I still have hope, but if all of these one star reviews do not make a change soon, that may change as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've changed my phone and this app now looks horrible, the new dark red/brown/pink colour theme is truly an eyesore and I cannot bare using it. The background is no longer white, but pink! Who is the psychopath who thought of this?!? On top of that there is no way to change it. Same with all Google apps, like Docs and Sheets. It's not a setting on my phone, I've tried to change the phone's theme and it's not it."

The touch areas on the sides seem to not work for some reason on the s23 ultra, android 14 in portrait. Rotating it via landscape and it works fine again. So clearly something about portrait touch zones are bugged...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The pop icon isn't floating where I need, near to the palm, close to the finger, so that we can tap it more easily. As a left hander it's a problem that the app icon only floating on the right corner of the screen. I'm continuously using it since last year. I need it everyday for my profession, I await for it's better version but it's make me frustrated. We use your app, we inform about our problem but does anyone read our words and try to understand our problems. Try to add more language"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Why this app icon doesn't support Material You icon theming in Samsung Galaxy phones?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I want to say how easy it is to use this. I had sold an item online to someone who only spoke Spanish. Using translate helped me tremendously with talking to the buyer. I love that you can copy the translation quickly instead of having to highlight it then copy it. This app is so useful and the fact that it has numerous other languages is so nice.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest update is terrible! Tap to translate is broken again. Must manually paste and clear first. 3 actions compared to zero before the last update. Inexcusable! Now UI is awful as well. Why does the app keep updating when I unchecked auto-update after reverting? STOP! Your update sucks! At least let us roll back. It auto updated again. If I'm forced to use this new UI I will have no choice but to find an alternative. Update. Still updating when unchecked. Still sucks. WHY WOULD YOU ADD STEPS?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app. Returned absolute gibberish for a Chinese translation. I'm learning Chinese and knew most of the words in the sentence I was translating and this app didn't get any of them anywhere near correct. Edit to reply to dev response: No, I won't be spending my time providing you with unpaid labor in the form of translation corrections. I'll just use a better translation app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey google! I have a suggestion : ""how about a feature to easily use google image translator (you know, scanning picture from a photo and let user / google automatically highlight the readable text) instead of capturing screen image and upload to google translate app, why not let the app use a floating and when activated the screen freeze and let the user select the text needed to translate?."" Thank you in advance!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Oh! Very bad experience I have to share here. Why you change the very lovely UI, whereas some essential features also lost. Before, when I copy any text by another apps/sites then the COPY option shown me automatically but nowadays why doesn't the option shown me? So far this one is very fantastic! Please, fix the bugs immediatly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"horrible update, give us back the old features, it was a comfortable, fast and practical app, now it is cumbersome and it takes a long time to find the commands to complete a trivial translation. the window is also too high on almost all mobile phones, not displaying the commands to use it correctly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have one question! I'm looking for any way possible to DOWNGRADE google translate on my phone/laptop all the way back to 2018-2020 period. It wasn't so advanced back then and it produced some isnanely funny stuff that i can't achieve with this modern version anymore,and i would really love to have more fun with it! any ideas anyone?? i tried downloading some old apk's to my phone but aparently our phones today are too advanced for these older versions of the app to work on them."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Having a bug on Pixel 6 Pro, that made the app unusable. Camera can't focus on the text or basically anything you hold within a hand distance. Except very large text and even it blurred a bit. No such issue on Pixel 3 at the same time. If not this issue - would have give 5 starts, since app is very useful. Hope for a fix soon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't know exactly about other user's experiences and bugs but I'm experiencing a very better camera in translating and especially in converting the photos into typed sentences. In past versions, the word's of a sentence were typed partialy and you had to gix it manually but now it's modified and boosted."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Live Lens translation doesn't work, even when I update Google app. [Update edit]: I think I solved the issue, I was running my Samsung phone on ""battery saving mode, limit home page and apps"", therefore it was constantly popping up that message to ""update the Google App"""
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app to translate photos I had saved on my phone, but now that it's using google lens it's useless.(Wrong translations, can't see the original characters, annoying pop up ALWAYS open at the bottom of the screen.) Google lens also ruines google image search too on that note. Honestly hope they scrap google lens all together some day."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't work for a month, and nothing happens even after sending feedback. It doesn't work in the main section of the app. There is always an error as ""can't translate, check your connection and try again."" But in the conversation section, it works!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Microphone button works very badly. It stops listening at the middle of the sentence and you need to start over. On a third or fourth try it does the job. Sometimes it ignores words or phrases as though you did not say anything. So instead I use keyboard's spech-to-text as it doesn't have any of these problems.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New UI is great. I used to love the ""Tap to Translate"" feature, but it no longer pops up on new phones (I have a Pixel 6) when you copy text; only if you permanently enable the floating bubble. This happens even if you allow it to appear over other apps"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usually works ok but for japanese photo translation when the text reads from right to left, the translated paragraphs are in the wrong order and ends of sentences are moved etc. Also can occasionally leave out large parts of text in the translated version for no reason"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"need to be improved by creating bottom window,while we touch the word, result should be shown on bottom window immediately. In tap and translate we have to copy that word first and then paste to translation window,it breaks our reading rhythm.Otherwise Google translation app is awesome. And please add phrase book in tap to translate window so we can save words side by side"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very handy when I run into French or Latin idioms I'm not certain I understand in books. I'm usually right, but nice to confirm. Handy when I receive a letter or pamphlet in another language. Just take a picture or point the camera and see it in English on the screen. Also useful when I can't think of a word in German."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app used to work when offline but now it does not. Can this be fixed? Update 11/25/23: I followed the instructions that I was given following an issue that I posted. Thankfully the problem was fixed and the app is working great again. Thank you for the prompt reply and for assisting in fixing this issue. I will edit my review from 3 stars to 5 stars!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate App is very good. But I don't like the change that the copy button instead at the top right has now been changed at the bottom right. Please return at the top right, the best and practical as well as comfortable position."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Outstanding and free this is absolutely the very best and easiest app of all translator apps .No need to look further or try others this is superior by far .I am rarely this impressed with any app and I must say this app has exceeded every expectation I had .I can't say enough it is spectacular thank you google I love my experience with Google Translate and would recommend this to everyone and will be sharing with everyone I know !!!

Also ""draw over other apps"" is enabled. Still, when text is copied no bubble shows up. It's a feature I used a lot, so it's disappointing that it is not working."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad experience, my cell phone is good, I have a good internet but the mic's button doesn't work very well...it understand the most of all word that I Says wrong. There are much better and more agile applications.nao. Do not download Google translate. It sucks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the fact that you can translate English to other languages other languages to English doesn't work as fluent or as fast as I would like it also doesn't have like an overlay thing you actually have to take it from one app to another app instead of just do it right then and there where you are it's more draining in the process that I think we need in world 🌎🌍
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google translate is helping me so much right now. There's big discussions about AI, and it's uses or not, but Google Translate is THE BEST practical AI tool in the World. To be able to communicate and understand different languages is ancient. We really have come far. And this app is the most important app any human can have."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I thought that my pixel 6 is bad and have problems to run your own app properly. But no, even with a new phone the app is slow and or it doesn't work at all. Such a simple app and you can't still make it just run.... What are you doing Google? You wanna be better in making stuff work bad than Bethesda??"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very hit or miss with downloaded languages. Tells me I need to download languages when offline, even though I did. Though sometimes it does work. Translations to and from Chinese are very poor but will suffice. Better than some other apps but needs some serious work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The latest update has made it unusable. I can no longer select the text from the image by swiping on it correctly. The UI (Google Lens) covers a large part of the text that needs to be translated. The translation for a Chinese character to English tells me the word is Greek! Not the character but the new update is definitely Greek to me.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sir, there is a big shortcoming in this app that for translation, if you want to translate a message etc. on the mobile screen, you have to copy the uptext, but if a magic button system is given in this app, it is very useful. It would be better if it could be translated very easily and there would be no need to copy the text on top of the screen"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the new update is horrible, the new UI isn't good and it replace text I write. Also for someone learning chinese this makes no sense because as soon as I type something the pinyin characters disappear. But thus doesn't appen if you revert the translation and then revert it again, which isn'tsomething really easy to do now that you removed the revert translation from the main UI. Also translating with google lens is now clunky and overall more frustrating. The web version is better"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Speech output failed in offline even after reinstalling
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So easy to use. We're traveling to Poland next year and I can see that this will be the app we need the most of words we won't know. You easily say anything in your language to translate to theirs. Then let them speak the answer and it will translate into English what they say. I've tried Duolongo app for beginners & that was a joke. Highly recommend for anytime you need to converse with anyone in another language.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please add more voices for reading the text that I input, and also the ability to make them read a bit faster. I don't know why Translate can't seem to use the voices I have set up in my phone's TTS options."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So mad about this update. You can't copy pinyin anymore. A lot of times the pinyin doesn't even show up under the Chinese characters anymore, either. Can't copy by long-pressing anymore. Have use the new ""convenient"" copy button. I used to think you were genius with this app. Why did you wreck it? The description says, ""Improvements."" Where are they?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In the older version, support camera you can still edit a text that have been type, and even give more decent Translation when it come with Google lens, But this latest version did not support that, it will tell me to download the latest version and if I try to download it will not download, Which make the app not too usable"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last word in a sentence in voice translation is often not recorded. This unfortunately makes the app useless. This has been a long standing bug since 2019. The bug doesn't happen on the Web version of the tool and it doesn't happen in apks of the same app from July 2019. The bug happens in any language and on my two phones, one a Pixel 4a with Android 11 and the other a Honor Android 6. Widespread bug since 2019, so I don't find all the fantastic monosyllabic reviews here credible"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The translation history doesn't get saved when translating with the copying text and having that draw over app pop-up. And translation history doesn't get saved anyways in reality, once the app is reinstalled all the data is gone! There's no cloud save SMH like how hard can it be to save a few translations in our Google Accounts. All my precious translations disappeared after reinstalling the app. You should add the language interchange arrow in the pop-up and allow us to type directly in there."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The current version of the app is very annoying and useless. Its preface is very messy. The previous version was great but I don't like this version at all. The previous version should be restored. The language change should be on the header.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Thai to English and vice versa is completely useless and non-sensical. Out of all the translation apps out there this is the worst. Two stars only because the camera text to translation seems to work well.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please I want the old version back. One of my favourite apps before the update, I gave feedback from email, no one replied, horrible user experience, not only it looks horrible, but the functions are also not working properly, I have no idea if the team have evev tested before they launch it. please, I want the old version, how can I download the old version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not happy with the push to FORCE us to use a Google account just to make the camera translate function use ""Google Lens"". I don't agree to Google Lens' terms and conditions nor to save my data. Translate didn't always used to require this, and now it does. I don't know when this changed happened or case, but the fact that cross EULA's are now auto-agreed to just by using this, I simply cannot in good faith ever recommend this app anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app! At First it worked well. From yesterday i noticed that i cannot select a certain portion from a picture to listen the pronunciation neither can translate.. it worked well before yesterday.. suddenly whats wrong with it
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It works very well, but sometimes history doesn't show."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since this new update, using your app that stopped saving all the translations has become very annoying. I'm very dissatisfied with the absence of useful library. Looks like I'm not the only one dissapointed with it after reading so many bad comments very similar and which I do agree with. Consequently, I have been looking for another app and will uninstall yours. Not being expert in IT, I have no other suggestion than to give the user le possibility to chose between the old or the new version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Doesn't work well It dosent pick up my voice half of the time. It inaccurately transcribes words when using your voice. The camera translation is absolutely horrible. It half translate the text on the image. If the text is not on a completely flat surface it will not translate. This app needs a lot of work. Its prematurely released.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate is working worst. In the pervious version that was working awesome. I hate because the pop shows on the screen all the time. It's irritating. The thing is need to improve is, the pop-up is need to show only when then we copying something. The 2nd, suppose we translate from English to Hindi. We put something in English and shows in hindi but when we want to reverse it by the arrow button it's not worked but it works in the website perfectly. History is not showing in the website"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very innacurate. Improperly assumed pronouns. Allows punctuation to drastically change context of phrase. You are often forced to break down smaller parts of a sentence and translate them individually to get the actual context of the translation. This is a very bad translation. Perhaps Google should use some of that AI behind this, because in it's current form, it allows for nothing more than extremely basic conversation, and even much of that will be incorrect. (English-Portuguese)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ads ads ads ads ads Want to translate something? Hope you've got several minutes. Open the app? Ad. Try to change the language? Ad. I'm honestly surprised I didn't get hit with an add every time I hit a key. Wanna skip all the ads? Wanna pay out the nose? This is extortion. Either charge what you're going to charge, or make it completely free without malicious ads. Especially since they're for awful mobile games that are designed to *also* bleed you for what you've got."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be great but now it's extremely difficult to use. The app keeps deleting the offline translation file which makes it work only when online. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times but the offline translation keeps getting stopped after 2 or 3 days from reinstalling the app. I hope Google can solve this issue soon.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good😊. It has many languages to translate into your desired language. And it has the offline translation too. But there needs some improvements to be done in the offline translation; because sometimes, it sucks😒😒. And sometimes, the audio translation sucks as well😒😒. Please fix these issues. 🤗🤗"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a good app, now it is garbage. Randomly deletes your messages when typing, the keybord blocks the copy button and the app now uses the minimize keyboard button to delete your translation and no copy in the history, what to use this for more than a sentence need a second app to type in then copy to this absolutely garbage design. Also no longer can easily switch language back and forth. Worst app update, worst user experience. Criminal they can force anyone to use such garbage update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version UI is really bad, the translation of the image becomes difficult, many parts of the image are covered by the menu button.

You Force the tap to translate icon to be there all the time in order to have half decent functionality within apps like WhatsApp. Before the tap to translate would be automatic once you copy the text. Now you have to have it there all the time in addition to other issues. Fix this and I will give you four stars maybe four and a half. I uninstalled this update and used previous.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am kindly asking the developer to stop the program or code or whatever/whoever from updating the older version of the apk that I've been using. You have no right to do that! It is my right to use any apk I want and any version of it I want. Older version with handwriting option is simply way better and more convenient for me as I learn Mandarin and I need this feature.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update makes this app useless... Previous to the update, it had many different features. It use to be a great app for language learners and had functionality that could be used in many different situations. Now it's a hollow shell of its former glory... Would only recommend for conversation translation now (and even that kinda sucks) Specifically for myself, I used it to help me learn Chinese. Now it's Pinyin functionality is near non-existent."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very helpful app, able to translate big passages nicely though not perfect in every language. Still need improvement. Can you bring dark/night mode in this google app also ? And also let users to add big translated passages in their account phrasebook. Currently it only supports small word addition in phrasebook. Thanks for not placing any advertisement in this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is easy and very simple also Very helpful
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Still works fairly well for words and short phrases typed in manually. But the new camera-based format removes instant translations, demands a photo and text selction (the parsing of which is difficult to navigate with specificity), and is overall borderline unusable. Massive step backward."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is an ergonomic nightmare. You can't change languages if you're writing, the button for history only appears when you're writing, swiping too much in the history brings you back to the home screen, the mic button disappears if you've already written something... That looks very much like an iOS app gone wrong."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have loved this app for ages, but the last couple of months it has been constantly going ""offline"" with a good internet connection. I tried the advice from the forum, have had temporary success with reinstalling, just for it to go back to ""offline"" mode. It looks like this is an issue for a few people. I really hope it gets fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update constantly show an error, 'Check your connection' even though the phone is connected to wifi. Feedback send to Google is not replied either. New Update 25 Oct 2022- Still the same issue exists. APP can't translate anything showing connectivity issues. All suggestions like clear cache, restart, uninstall and restart, report to feedback system done but still there is no concrete action from Google team."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app sucks now. Why am I forced to use Google lens? It worked perfect before, translated way better than it does now. I can't highlight, the translation are much more inaccurate. It was fine the way it was. Why am I not given the option to stay with the old program? I literally NEED this app to help with translations for work, now I can't rely on the translation. They are wildly inaccurate. What the heck did yall do Google. Never heard the saying if it ain't broke DONT FIX IT. Yall broke it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google Translate is a very helpful translator that can even do translations into Latin. There is something I would really like added. When you select text and press the Google Translate button. there should be a way to change the text selected to the feminine or masculine forms. That would be very helpful.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my favorite among translators, but after the redesign it became very awkward to use. Instead of one click on the cross, you first need to click on the word, and only then delete (which is rather unintuitive) and start writing a new one. Inconvenient access to translation by photo."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For OVER A YEAR now, there has been a problem with the handwriting feature (the only previously effective way to translate languages like Chinese or Japanese) where each new character entered causes the entite sentence before then to appear. For example, if you handwrite A, B, C, you get AABABC. They might respond, saying they can't replicate it (trans: we don't care and can't be bothered to). They might say some other bs. The truth is that their software doesn't work and they aren't fixing it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I will say the truth the app is very good and wonderful... But ever since this days i have been experiencing some bad issues that i don't like... The tap to translate is no longer removing anymore unless you have to off the tap to translate.. thats the only problem that i don't like about the app.. if in my own opinion i will like to tell the app owner to correct it by updating the app the new version so that the tap to translate will be removing and fast in translating...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Have used this app daily in conversation with my wife who only speaks Mandarin Chinese (Simplified). If it weren't for this app we would not be able to communicate as effectively as we do. The app does have its limitations and faults but for the most part works well for us. It sometimes has problems recognizing words that sound similar.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App does not download any languages for offline use. One star is as low as Google will allow, so that's what it gets considering their ""customer service"" is nonexistent when it comes to ANY uncommon problem. The 'Help' topics from below are useless. My connection is stable, both on Wi-Fi and mobile data connections. Other apps work just fine. The app simply does not work, and as I've stated already, ""support"" is nothing more than a bot passing reviewers off to dead end self help articles."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am using this for English to German. How about offering translations that Germans actually speak? Instead of lots of gibberish nobody does. Additionally, it automatically assumes either formal or informal and its never the one you want. It should display both. However many of the translations are incorrect and not spoken in German."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have used this app for over a year in SE Asia. I am particularly disappointed and often frustrated by the lack of AI learning it has. I am constantly having to stop the voice from saying some really embarrassing things after a failure to translate correctly. I wish there was some learn capability to the app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I agree the ever present bubble icon is a PAIN. I only need it when I'm translating a phrase. It used to appear only when I highlighted a phrase. With this version it is always in the way. I have to keep moving it out of the way. If I move it to the bottom of the screen it is turned off and not available for ""tap to translate""."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Interface is not really good. After importing a picture, if you want to change translation language, you have to re-import the picture after that. Also, would be nice to have an option to share an image from any other app into the translator and have it translate the image, as if you had imported it. Copy anywhere to translate is gone too - which was the key feature for me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. It is still useful but I, ike many others, are not pleased with the new update and new looking interface. The steps it takes just to get a quick translation is unnecessary. Also my floating icon frequently isappears... It never stays on my screen. I have to keep going into the app and reselecting it to appear. Overall I love this app because I need this app and because it's the most universal app for translation service. Please improve. Thank you in a"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used another app for a year and my biggest problem was when I wrote numbers it always translated to the numerical value. Was pretty stupid to think when I want to ask for six hundred in another language the translator gives me 600. Pretty frustrating. So far my only problem with this app is I need Serbian offline and it doesn't exist on this app. I gave three stars. Would have been five if Serbian was available offline. Just got a response from Google partly in English and partly in some other language I didn't understand. Asking for something I didn't understand because it wasn't in English. Epic fail. Dropped them from three stars to two. Next time they pull this I'll look elsewhere.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This used to be such a fantastic application. However the Tap to Translate feature no longer works in Android 10. This is all to do with removing the ability for Translate to access the Clipboard. Android 10 has increased security to the extent that it is reducing functionality. Rendering the app pretty much useless. Fix it! This can be done by implementing a similar 'Privacy Guard' feature present in LineageOS. Give us users the ability to grant Clipboard access permission on a per app basis!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do a fix already that you application time to time lags and crushes when I open it/start typing something/tap a sign “change languge” and all other actions! This bug is take place more that ONE YEAR! The same error on 3 android devices Galaxy Note 10 plus, Tab s6, galaxy s9. Android of the 9th version. I have the latest version of ur program. This bug has taken place in each version within all releases of last year."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is amazing, such a smart app, you can translate in any form, verbal, typing, pictures and writing. The only problem is that sometimes it doesnt use the right words in the right senses and sometimes it messes up a bit. Apart from that, this is the best app ever."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the recent update the ability to show the translation in big letters fullscreen has been removed when the phone is turned to landscape mode has been removed. This was a very important aspect of the app but now its gone, please look into implementing it again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My experience with this app is somewhat enjoyable. I love how I can learn new words and phrases in many different languages, although Google translate isn't like a genie in a lamp where it can grant you your wishes. Google translate doesn't translate most words from English to your preference of choice (in languages). Remember that the app isn't ALWAYS reliable to use, but you can make a learning journey of it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"functional and helpful, but it would be more useful if a realtime translation feature available for a specific part of the screen, i mean whenever you see a foreign language mixed in an app or in a web or in a picture you can instantly call the translation function for it just like through the camera translation. if this feature already available please let me know. thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bring the old app back, why did you ruin it? Now if i translate into another language that doesn't use latin script the alternate translations at the bottom doesnt show latinized versions of spellings. It used to show those. If it aint broke, don't try to fix it. Also, if i accidentally write in the opposite language and try to switch it quickly, there used to be a button for that purpose that let me quickly swap two languages. Now it's gone and you have to go back and type whole sentence again"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience with the new current update. It used to be better. The problem I have is converting Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese. You would expect the least error, because it's not converting from one language to another. No! It totally change many words or terms! It even insert words that I didn't type!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent UI update is a perfect example of how to break something that was working perfectly fine. I don't understand what's up with the recent trend at Google where they redesign UI of their apps just for the sake of redesigning. Instead of making new products, they waste their energy on making existing products less user friendly. If anyone at the top is trading these reviews, for the love of God, stop this please."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be one of my faverate translation tool because whenever I would copy something the icon would pop up that was quite helpful to translate stuffs right off the bats but now after updating the application I realised that the wonderful feature is gone now just there is a floting icon option that stays on the screen all the time and that is quite irritating. I would like the team to fix this issue asap.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the new update, I mostly use the app for scan/translating pictures, now it's really hard for me to pick which word that I want to translate. Also I hate that I can't write anymore, I usually fix the mistranslation by writing it myself. What I wanted to say that the new update is SUCKS. I think the old one is a lot simpler. If you wanna make the app better, I'd say you just gotta stick to the translation accuracy not the app interface"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google apps are working very badly on my Samsung S22 Ultra, which includes Translate and Earth. They simply just do not work. I re-downloaded it multiple times and it doesn't work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be easy to use but ever since the newest update which changed the app completely, it is confusing and very user unfriendly. Whenever I used the app I noticed it would frequently translate my words incorrectly and I would have to go back and retranslate them. Google has a long way to go before I would even rate this app 3 stars let alone 5. The new update sucks. Change it back the way it was and focus on making the translator more accurate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I couldn't use it. I have pictures of conversations with friends from online. where on PC I can copy and paste to Google Translate, I can't on my phone. I took screenshots instead, and there was no option for me to upload a screenshot for translation. I don't have the symbols to type it in, so this app was useless to me either way. Seemed like it would be decent enough for someone else"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This version is really unsuccesful. I won't even bother to explain why. I simply uninstalled the app, reinstalled the old version and had to disable automatically update feature for ALL the other applications as well to prevent the latest version to be downloaded against my wishes. Now i have to start manually each time when an upgrade occurs:(( And please, please do not post an automated reply pretending that you're caring, asking me to elaborate the issue. Previous reviewers have elaborated it"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This latest update has really annoyed me. When I enabled the ""tab to translate"" option, the icon of the app shows up on the screen all the time. Which is really a annoying for me. Previous version of this app had a decent feature of when I copied any text, only then it showed up which was far better than current one."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is completely impractical and the Google translation has become worse. In the old version, it was translated in the absence of an internet connection, because I had already downloaded the files of the languages that I wanted to translate, but now it has become worse so that it does not have speed settings or appear on other applications😠😠😠😠"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love it, but after update last night now there's a PERMANENT notification when tap to translate is on. Whoever thought that was a good idea, should be fired. I leave mine on all the time, I don't want a forever notification banner about it. Absolutely ridiculous. Another case of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have appreciated the features on this app to help with real time text and audio translations. The translations for the most part are accurate, and as with any translation from another language, there are variances depending upon the dialect & slang, but for the most part pretty good."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good but When im using the camera "" scan "" and take a picture it's very glitchy as it does not qualify all the words I'm saying it doesn't see the words even tho it's so clean and not messy it's so buggy everytime I try to translate a long essay please fix this and sometimes the translations aren't accurate, and I know that some languages have short cutted words but there are some that aren't yet the words translated isn't ACCURATE I'll give this a 2 star"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"[Fixed] Translation using an image keeps crashing on Samsung Galaxy S10+. It cannot load any useful translations at all. It's extremely annoying needing to highlight one phrase, then restart the whole process just to highlight a different section of text from the same image - the app assumes you want one selection of text translated and then that's the end of the process. While connected to WiFi the app crash troubleshooter says I need a data connection for the app to work...? Awful right now"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use the voice feature constantly at work for customers of other languages. The only issue I have and the reason I knocked a star off, is that the conversation mode microphones switch off or switch users way too quickly. A way to add seconds before it deactivates in the settings would be appreciated!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is already a very useful app But.. Both the developers and Google has done a very good job with this app but I feel this app is incomplete and not fully packed with everything needed, it lacks features like synonyms, antonyms, definition of the word in the same language and in other languages. I would like to request both Google and the developers to work on these features and add these features. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I prefer the old style. Never had a problem with that. I was surprised the app automatically updated into this and it's a PAIN! trying to see how i could translate from the ""floating window"" where all I have is ""Detect Language"" option. Like what is the sense of that? BRING BACK THE OLD STYLE!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPD: I didn't know that the UI of the app can be broken so badly. Now you can't even swap the language, because there is no icon anymore. You doing great google, continue plz. \nThank you for killing the tap to translate feature. Now we have another useless google app. It has amazing permanent notifications plus a permanent bubble on thescreen. And if u hide this tap to translate doesn't work. Amazing solution! (Google, your link doesn't solve the issue. Your link about nonworking bubble at all)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its great when it works, but it hangs a lot. You enter text and the circular progress arrow just goes round and round and never does the translation. I look forward to this getting fixed so the program can be relied upon, unlike the current state of affairs."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved to apply its previous feature which was disappeared before its new pointless annoying solid bubble what helps nothing. The previous was pretty cool. After select word and hit copy you had quickly the translation in any app. But now before a translation, several mumbo-jumbos should have been done. It's not good and pointless."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The live translate function is so amazing. I use this app daily and it has improved immeasurably just in the last probably 5+ years I have been using it. I work near an international airport in customer service and can pull out my phone and use live translate to communicate with anyone quickly and easily. Also extremely useful for language learning or reading/watching foreign media. Scanning images to translate text is life changing and I can't imagine what we did before google translate!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was perfect and has been converted to nightmare. Was there no user testing? . Biggest problem is it doesn't always does pinyin if Chinese to English or if using thesaurus (I don't know all the Chinese symbols).

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"recommend put back the (X) on the top right corner so that we can erase and type the word by one click only,and also found a bug that is the Translate connected with network will be slow down the speed (delay 2~5s)when using it,and also recommend to put more details on the translate word meaning so that I don't need to switch to another translate app to search for more,TQ."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""If it ain't broke don't fix it"". The previous layout was fine and everything. Yes you can improve speed and increase the vocabulary inside the app but otherwise there's no change necassary whatsoever so I don't know which idiot thought that somehow a complete overhaul of the app would be good. Please bring back the previous version."

""Use translate without an account"" works once before being blocked & new message ""Maximum Characters exceeded"" app NOT work without allowing Google Translate to save a history of translations under our accounts. Some items in a digital society you can't seek to record, monetize and run ads over the top.

There's so many ridiculous ""non-translation"" that I have to check the English description so as to know the meaning of a word, and the worst part is: even if I wanted to make some contribution by correcting the translation you have, there's no way for me to do it on the phone! It can only be done on a browser...On top of that, the scanning function is worse than ever."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have enjoyed relying on Google Translate for many years but I have deleted it since the most recent update. Google has destroyed what was a very good app. Now it's just an interfering heavy waste of time that barely even work's. I'm lead to wonder if it's changed from a Translation app to an app loaded to Spy on the user. Junk now.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The latest version brought with it some bugs, like effectively making the region section in the settings obsolete where you could change the accent of a language. In my case, I was using English (US) but it now defaults to my English (India). Also, I tried disabling 'Prefer network text-to-speech' under 'Data Usage' and it should have worked, defaulting to whatever voice you set in your phone's settings, except it's US, voice Ⅰ, which is not very human-like; robotic, synthetic."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The always on in Android 10 is annoying. Why ruin a good thing? Let me be more clear. The floating bubble, since it is always on, gets in the way no matter where I position it. If I dismiss it, it is not there when I need it. It worked perfectly well for me when I copied text and then the bubble appeared for me to use or not, depending on whether or not I needed a translation. Perhaps give users a choice (a) always on, or (b) on when you need it - like it was previously. I'll pick ""b."""

I check all the permission, draw over other app, and all the notification turn on, but its not working. I dont care about the new design look, just it lost the basic function, to fast translation by copy-and-tap in one click."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works on the most part, but, often offline translation packs dissappear and you are forced to go online to translate. And here's the kicker, you can't re-download said language pack unless you reinstall the application. Please fix this. (If you don't, I'd think it's just an intricate scheme to get more and more downloads to your application.... Disgusting)"

The app keeps crashing when I try to import a screenshot of text and force closing + restarting the app doesn't help... so far the only thing that has was restarting my phone but I don't want to do that everytime I want to translate a new screenshot."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very difficult to use. Can't even see what is focusing. It becomes a blur when I focus over text and it takes longer time to translate. It's gotten worst compared to the initial version. What is there to upgrade when the basic functionalist of the previous version is not working? Looking for other translator app now. Once translate can't even zoom to read...just put instant function as default...what is the reason to press camera then press instant again?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm using it to translate Japanese to English. I use a tablet and pen. To translate I have to tap into the text box and then tap again the pen icon. The app has to much space unused in tablet mode. History tab is hidden. Japanese text written in Latin characters (romaji) would be really helpful if it was next to the translation. You have to open the text translation to see how what you are translating is pronounced.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The layout is a bit weird at first but you can use to it. The biggest problem is with the history section which is in an oldest to newest order now so I have to scroll to the top to see the latest translation which is ridiculous.

I really miss the previous function.

Camera would only say ""aim at text"" with no translation so worthless with menus or signs. Microphone never worked with this app so I couldn't use it with people I trying to talk with. Removing it as soon as I'm done writing this review. So disappointing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For a learner, the microphone function is sub par. In both my native language English and the one I am practicing the voice deception always cuts off the last word you say, not matter how fast or slow you say it. It's been like this for years. The Web browser is much better with the microphone to speech."

Disappointing."

It takes several goes & dumbing down the language to kindergarten levels in short simple sentences. Also, there's no history. I had lists of regular phrases that I could reuse. Now? Gone. This app is useless"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Not perfect but it's getting better and much more usable then previous versions. Much more spontaneous than relying on written language guides. I had a 1hr conversion in Spanish with a stranger completely with this app over dinner. Otherwise would have just smiled and dined in silence... Keep improving this one Google...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new UI is really bad for common use cases. Here's a common use case: 1. Open Grab Food (which often shows menu item in Thai script which I can't read) 2. Take screenshot 3. Switch to Google Translate, switch to Photo mode, select screenshot Repeat 2 and 3 multiple times to go through the entire menu and options This use case seems pretty typical to me. Yet it's extremely cumbersome. Please improve OS platform Integration. Adding Translate to the ""swipe up"" task switch UI would be great."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have never come on here to write a review like this but the changes made to the new version are horrible... i have given more than a month to see if I could get used to it and be fair but nope and they cause nothing but problems ... example it changes keyboard settings and does not allow you to change language while you are writing a message ... when you are going back and forth between multiple langues you spend more time fixing message than writing .. i could write a lot more
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update sucks. Each time I open the app while offline, it keeps saying ""you're offline"", which is very annoying. Yeah yeah I'm very much aware of the fact that I'm offline, and I've got offline language packages downloaded for such situations. Then what's the relevance of annoying me this way? Plus, why on earth have you guys removed the cross signed option to exit the window showing translation results of a selected text while the app isn't directly opened? Totally ruined the app. 👎"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last update is simply terrible. There's no function reverse translation on the final translation page. If you want to reverse, then, you have to go back, but the translation is already lost. Is this a joke? Just try it yourself please. The translation history is highly uncomfortable to use. And just a question: do you guys test your apps on volunteers before implementing your updates?! Just why, why???😭😭😭 Update for the sake of update? I never wanted the previous version so badly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I think this app for taking a picture and asking for a translation is in need of more work. It took me in circles, and the explanation of how to do it wasn't clear. Im uninstalling due to the fact i have limited space, and cannot afford to have a useless app taking up my cell's oxygen. Perhaps it works better for spoken words, but that is not what i was looking for, at this time. I needed (Czeck) words written on the back of an old photo to be translated, and it just didnt work."

When I tap the mic icon for speech to text, I haven't even finished saying my complete sentence & app decides to cut off my voice input. This is really frustrating because i end up with half my sentence almost 98% of the time. To circumvent this, I had to switch over to conversation mode which does capture the entire sentence I want to say. Can you make the mic button press & hold to speak; & release when done?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app was wonderful. I always used this for most of translation. But recently it hasn't updated more. Since many other competitors have excellent translation than this. Facebook auto translate for posts is far more better than this nowadays. Other are working hard but it seems Google not doing. Google still using same method to translate. It tries to match each word which results in meaningless translation. It should use AI that can understand meaning of sentence and translate instead.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While the app used to be very user friendly, now the camera function requires Google app, which takes up 1.2GB Ram and the pause camera is now capture, making no sense why this change was necessary. Also history of translation is buried deep now. As a translator it is great, can even translate hand written sentences, but when it comes to actually quickly using the app, it has now become complete garbage. It was much much better before. Please remove the dependency on Google app."

The language settings keep getting reset and it keeps disabling the Tap to translate functionality every few hours Also the bubble disappears frequently and randomly and you have to go through the tedium of making it visible again It used to work great in the past - automatically showing up when you copy text
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i still prefer the old version of layout where u can easily access & browse the history. Suggestion: 1)pls allow us to translate instantly with the camera filming without actually take photo/record video 2)pls enable/integrate google translate to work within other apps, so we can translate immediately/seamlessly without the need to copy & paste into google translate, with translation option, for words (e.g. title/comment/content), videos (improve accuracy of caption & language option), pic etc."

I have to kill the app, turn off the screen, wait 10 secs then turn on the phone and relaunch the app again. When you are in a rush and you need something translated this is fairly annoying. I have to do this every time I need to use the app."

I want to translate from English to German and from German to English but that's not possible unless I go in the drop down menu and change the languages. A switch option is a must."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is not as smart as the previous version...as in....when I click ""copy"", the previous version will auto pop up the icon and translate automatically. Whereas the new session is..1) I need to do extra step, click the icon floating on my screen 2) need to change the language if different from the previous translations 3) the floating pop up is irritating.

The app then speaks the translation of what you said in the language of the person you speak with!OCR mode uses Google Lens tech and has amazing text tecognition.

This is a critical feature, since you can't really increase the size of the translated text. I used this all the time to show people with poorer eyesight. Until this is fixed, this app is useless to me, and I'll use other translation apps, such as one from Microsoft."

I would think that Google could design an app that would be compatible with their own Android operating system 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ how hard is it to design an app that is compatible with an operating system that you created?! That would be like ASUS designing a graphics card that doesn't fit in a case that they made 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"

Read online that its due to new Android software preventing clipboard permissions, but the alternative given doesn't help. Even if it now has to be in the notification bar, you will have to manually copy text to paste into the floating window.

Since most of the time the instant translation takes too much time and stable hand. However, lately after updating the app, seems like the scan and import feature disappeared which left me with only instant translation feature which is totally confused me. How to make it visible again? Did you guys delete that function?? Why???"

Additionally, send feedback to support ends up in a no-reply email, using the community is pointless (it's not monitored by google) and sending in-app feedback doesn't really highlight the problem."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was better before when you would copy text and then the bubble would come up with the translation instead of having it on floating and always being on the screen or actually having to open it and paste it. Would be great if it was changed back to the way it was.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,On my old S7 edge the tap to translate worked fine. Now I have the S20fe and tap to translate does not have a pop up at all and you have to make several steps to translate now. Also it won't give you an option in a lot of apps at all like Line. This is much worse than the old version. Some things are well left alone when they work.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App has been completely ruined. The Tap to Translate feature used to be very intuitive for translating conversations and allowing you to translate a response back. It is now completely ruined. You need to have the bubble open 24/7 and not just when copying text as well as the response feature being removed.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please rollback the interface change you made. This is a total disaster. Google should fire all the business analysts and QAs who pushed this update! It used to be so easy to use... you need a history of previous searches - it's right there, you need to reverse the translate language - just click the icon, you need to clear the text area - just one click and it's clear! Now the app is so uncomfortable to use! Very sad!"

I mean like what the heck is this app. Before, this app was like the best, no glitches, in short it *was perfect*. But now, after updating it, it's the worst. It has hearing problems, don't catches the words properly so I have to write it. It's irritating and I always get frustrated. In short this app is terrible. I wish I haven't updated this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has significantly improved over the years. In 5 years with my French husband the accuracy is much improved. It's a great way for me to copy messages from family WhatsApp groups into the app for a quick translation. Of course with any translation it is hard to be perfect but I find using this even helps me to verify my own understanding or attempt at writing in French. Keep up the improvement, I'm guessing using ML, to learn for informal, day-to-day usage be the best in the market."

In fact if you're a traveler with some essential language skills, this app will no longer meet your needs. I strongly suggest that you use some of the competitor's app. The history is not longer a viable function ."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Google Translate is definitely a great app. It lets you translate sentences from one language to another quite easily. The only change I would suggest and would like to be added to the app is actually to the list of languages. I would really appreciate if Sanskrit to different languages translation is also added to the list of languages.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was once a great and must have app but is now extremely cumbersome to use. Needing to have the icon always up is annoying and distracting. I realise this is a restriction with the clipboard in android 10 but it has made translate unusable for me. Please find a way to allow the icon to appear on an as needed basis rather than all the time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate is, surely, one of the best apps in the entire Google stable.

USELESS APP NOW...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app can only be used moderately well if you already have a fairly good knowledge of the language for which you are looking for a translation because of certain subtleties or to be safe. But what an often nasty surprise: For transfers into English alone, the original text in the language to be processed must be 'incorrectly chewed in accordance with English standards' in order to obtain useful results. The use of the apparantly only English-based app is not at all recommendable."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Your translation skills are good, but sometimes it can be frustrating because it focuses only on the literal meaning of individual words. When we input a paragraph, it would be better if you translate it as a whole, considering the context and providing a proper translation of the entire paragraph. I hope you can improve this aspect soon."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Conversation mode is just ridiculous. Awefull and useless unless you record the person speaking with another device and speed up the recording superfast otherwise it will translate about 3 words . If there is any sort of short pause like everyone does when they speak , it stops listening and translates causing you to miss every thing said afterwards. . A simple solution would be to allow the user to be able to start and stop when it is . listening."

Worse still the forced translate backups - why would I want to do that????!! If I did want to keep backups I would take a photo!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Regret updating this app! I wish I can roll back to the previous version. The new version does not allow speech output for detect language when I long pressed and select the text for translation . It requires me to open the main app before I get speech output. Very inconvenience, why would this be an improvement?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new version has multiple functionality inconveniences. You need either more time or more steps to do certain things compared to the previous version. I'm switching to Yandex since it's similar to Google Translate. GT now looks like Bing used to look like the last time I used it, not a fan, at all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is really good. you can use it to translate a continuous conversation between 2 people of different languages without having to keep clicking the translate button; it will automatically detect and translate the languages. you can just set it and put the phone on the table. very easy to use.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Maybe I'll go against the grain here but I believed this app needed a fresh new look (the previous iteration was essentially the same since Android Marshmallow). This design isn't yet the most visually pleasing but it is getting there (actually this was the look already available inside Google Assistant's translate/convo functionality). One suggestion: the ability to turn on dark mode directly in the settings menu (same request for every verion of Google Maps regardless of Android version).
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the new update with the camera and image translation, BUT now with image text translation, unlike before which disregards unnecessary spacing, this new update regards and add too many space characters that makes translating image text frustrating and incorrectly (example, a sentence that extend/break into 2 lines is regards as 2 separate translations). In addition, text selection can't be easily edited to correct those unnecessary spaces unless it's send to translation home."

And underneath it says waiting for network connection. I know there is no problem with my Internet connection or my WiFi connection but all your doing is showing on my notifications a flashing arrow waiting for network connection. I've turned my phone on and off and it keeps reappearing. Its annoying because I know my connection is ok
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google translate has been amazing for me! I know very little of any language but English and with my friends whose native language is not English it has helped to to communicate better, learn Spanish and socialize more bilingually. You can type or speak in your native language and it will translate into ANY language as well as able to photograph foreign text and it will scan and translate. It gives definition and verb/noun placement. Overall,I couldn't be more pleased. Very user friendly! Get it"

Although there have been improvements in the interface (It really does help things easier to look tho) but it further limits the number of words that can be translated.

Please don't make your users constantly choose to use the Google account or no account it is incredibly annoying."

Same old story, Google trying to think for us, only they are not a fraction as cleaver as they think they are. If you paste txt in, maybe with a typo in it, it now automatically changes it to what it thinks it was meant to say, rather than leaving it to your own intelligence to rectify. Many of us told Google to give us the old App back when they changed the format, Google ignored. Sad world."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Always loved the app, but didn't like the new update with the always floating icon. Earlier I could get the translate icon on demand when text was copied. But now you've to choose either always on screen or never. Could you bring back the old functionality?? That was way cooler! I'm reverting back to the older version for now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate has really been messed up with, it's no more like 'tap to translate' as before you just had to copy the text and tap the button to translate but now you need to copy then click the tap to translate button then if there is an already translated text you need to clear the translation and then paste your text to get the translation, it's as if you're opening the main app to translate, and sometimes even the translation is not right."

You have copy the translated text into the writing window then you can press the speaker to have audio. It seems to work on an iPhone but not a pixel 4a. So Google software works on other phone correct but not their own
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Since the latest revision Google Translate has been cutting off the last couple words in just about every sentence I speak. It also has been adding a lot of extra punctuation particularly periods. If you could go back to the previous version or fix this current revision there be a lot better.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a really good app, but it's garbage these days. The interface is really hard to understand. If I try to edit the translated language it is not working. I hope we get our old interface back or this interface will be changed. Voice recognizer also a trash can. It can't recognise a single word. Particularly I am facing problem in English to Bengali"

Generally is a good app, but the update instead of fixing bugs, creates bugs.... Go figure."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible new layout. It has no easy access to putting a ""star"" on it for favorites. No easy way to do a reverse translate. A symbol that looks like it might be a reverse translate asks you to rate the translation! If I knew, would I be seeking a translation? (Just out of spite, they are going to get bad answers.) And the ""detect language"" seems to be broken."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great translating app. I thought it was a bad app at first, some things just did not make sense. I asked our Korean translator to look at what I had questions on, she verified the translations were correct. I use the camera and text everywhere.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: development team does not get it, this application used to work like a charm. Not interested in reading a forum post on why it doesn't work like that anymore. No reason to break something that works --- After Android 10 update tap to translate does not work as it used to. Now you either can't use the function at all or you're stuck with the bubble at all times! Is this is intentional? This completely ruins the tap to translate experience which used to be a life saver for me!"

So it's so vivid for me. Please let the problem be finished."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Google Translate for a few years now, and I must say that I am not very satisfied with the quality of the translations. Google Translate is a convenient tool for quick and simple translations, but it often fails to capture the nuances, context and tone of the original text. It also struggles with idioms, slang and complex sentences. Sometimes, the translations are so inaccurate or nonsensical that they cause confusion or embarrassment."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,One of the recent updates removed the feature where if you rotate into landscape mode the translation goes into full screen. I think that feature should be brought back. I used Google translate a lot with elderly people and having to translation large sized was extremely useful.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app as it really helps me everyday. However, I have one suggestion. Could you please add English-English mode to the dictionary? In my opinion, it'd be useful for the most of users as it allows to get the direct definition of the word you're typing in without scrolling through all the translations that can't help you in some cases. Also, this function could help users to improve their knowledge of the English language."

Clearly printed signs and t-shirts, laid out flat, seem to baffle the camera. It's only reliably working feature has been manually typed in foreign words, which is hard to do when coming from a language with a non-Western alphabet."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok overall everything works great, except the camera.( the camera is mostly the reason I got this) I have a few things that have Japanese on it, the text just has a different font. So anything that has a different or odd font this app can't read. Leaving me with a shirt that has Japanese on it, and I don't know what it says."

Every time I try to communicate while holding the Google assistant button, the assistant thinks I'm talking to it. So for example, saying ""Hi, how are you"" in English to be translated into Italian, the assistant thinks I'm talking to it and says ""I'm great, thanks for asking"". How the heck do you fix this!!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most features are available in the Translate Website, but the camera feature... Yes! Super helpful live translation, although it does look a little weird and hard to read sometimes. You can also translate anything from a photo you made or translate something dialogue-like when someone else is talking to you."

On the old version , immediately as you copy a text , the floating icon appears and as you tap, it automatically paste itself. but now the new version, you have to tap clear first before you can paste and translate it doesn't copy automatically, and it doesn't detect language . The older version was perfect and i would give the old version +5 star ⭐"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My app just updated and I feel the pain! I have been using Google translate almost every day and have come to like it ery much but this update breaks many things. Firstly the new layout is awful. Also why does the icon remain over everything after translation? It was so much better before: it was just sitting in the back and whenever I copied some text it would just pop up with the translation.I don't want to have the icon overlaid on my screen all the time and getting in the way.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is nice but the new style user interface is absolutely trash compared to how it used to be about a year ago. You can literally spend 30 minutes typing a message with deep thought or feels and an accidental move erase everything. It's a complete joke and total trash because of bad design of where they put buttons. I used to recommend this app to everyone but I tell more people to stay away.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"18apr22: I made a mistake cose I trusted them. I suggest the users NOT TO UPDATE. This update DOES NOT KEEP history nor the pronunciation button! I am not interested in fancy colors. I want to go back to the version I used to use. After all, if something new affects your way of doing your things, there is NO value added to the customer. I am expecting a robot fancy, polite customer service text that would try to massage my ego. ALL I want from CS is a link to return to previous version."

Example... Whenever i used to copy text, the app would pop up to all copy and ask to translate. Now, no clue what's happening. Nothing in app to change required settings..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's not as accurate as it could be, but for artificial intelligence it's as good as it can get! The photo and speaking convo options are great. I wish there was a way to apply translations on any app or site through GT. On a chromebook you can do that, but not on any other device."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a disgrace to Google if Google Translate continues to neglect its issues. I can't download languages for offline translation. I brought this matter to you via Help & Feedback in the App. No response from you. And no resolution of the problem after several ""uninstall"" and ""install"". I have checked my settings to make sure that Google Translate is not denied any permissions. I'm using Nokia 6.1 on Android 9."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For years,this app has been a great tool for me. All of the features worked fine.After few several update, some feature seemed to disappear. Chinese speech output is gone. The dictionary (for English) is gone. Sometimes it does not translate all. Vee pee en apps seems to affect its functions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The camera functionality is now much improved over older versions of this app. I can take a picture of a whole page of text, and then scan around translating individual words as needed. However, it would be even better if we could select a word, choose ""Send to Translate Home"" to get more info about the word, and then go back to the photo. Right nowhere else to know"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Return the old UI or make something better and simpler as an update, otherwise becoming a ""downdate"". I finally made peace with the limitation of scan-translate and now there is this...duh But thanks for your service, anyway. Edit: With the new UI, you try to solve the scan-translate editing limitation. Now it is customizable with full screen. In addition, basic translate feature feels smoother than when it was first released. But still I gave a 4.499 star."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It now forces you to enable unnecessary Google play services permissions to use image translation. It's obvious the app can work on its own without it, as it will occasionally bug out and bypass the prompt. Google, please stop forcing big brother services on all your apps. Let me choose separate permissions for separate apps."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be great for Japanese, but with the new update, as others have stated, it's now borderline useless. Bring back the option to just take a picture and highlight texts because now it's as if you've just removed that and left us forced to use the terrible instant translation option, which is worthless."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,At the beginning it was the worst app ever as all its functions like the camera one were useless and we have to write full paragraphs to translate them but now with its instant feature it has been a magical thing for me as I can translate very big paragraphs just by holding my phone towards it . I would like to thank google and the developers for adding the instant feature its really helps a lot.

Thanks for the fast response. I tried from photos, it just said the message, not supported. I will uninstall later and try that, thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The translations are not always good. I have to break down the sentences almost to individual words in a lot of cases, or I just guess at what is meant... and I really dislike the new update. It is a lot less user friendly when being used in dual screen mode."

Siriously! TERRIBLE!!! I really hope You do something about it. The way it is now is just inconvenient. Tap to translate is extremely convinent in old popup form. Please don't make our lives harder for security reasons, it can't be one over the other. It must be secure but remain convinent for the user. Thx"

The locals of Thailand usually laugh after reading the translation of English to Thai... Just requesting you to solve it if you can."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was a 5-star app until they decide to keep the translate bubble on the screen forever instead of popping up only when the texts are copied. **Read the thread as developer suggested, and found nothing helpful. Only excuses of how they have to remove the clipboard functionality. Not convinced as Gboard can still access clipboard just fine.**"

Please give us an option to hide the annoying circle. **Edit based on Dev response : I have the latest version. The issue is that Tap to Xlate only works if the circle is always visible. If I dismiss the TTT circle, it turns off TTT. Before the update, this worked well. I see many complaints. Your users are not happy."

As of April 5th 2022 How can we go back to the older style? Update June 19th 2022 Still no response on how to revert to the older style. I keep uninstalling and installing the app in hopes I'm able to revert butt no such luck. Whenever you chose to go back to select a different definition for example it clears out the weird you have translated

Ring fence the input box so its not translated! Please ! Then it will be way more useful as a learning aide rather than just a translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app and google deserves a thank you for what it provides for free 👏. But there's need to be a feedback. Everything works well just please improve more on this so it could be even better, f.e. maybe iclude metaphors? Like : ""who let the cat out of the bag?"" Translate it literally but also include how it's meant to be understood:""who told you the secret?"". Just an example 🤷"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wouldn't say this app is bad, in fact, this app is good but it has a few mistakes. First mistake is when you go to the camera to translate, the words you want to translate appears being blur, which does not translate a single word. Second mistake is that when you search for a word to translate, the meaning of the word is not accurate to the real meaning. I hope you reply telling me if it's just my phone or it's your app. I truly understand if it's a misunderstanding or if it's a mistake. :D"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst ""updates"" I've seen, removed so many good features for no good reason 1- removed and replaced the bubble that only shows up when copying text and auto translates it to now having it always there and not catching the copied text a downgrade from 2 convenient steps with no annoying HUD element to what we have now a 24/7 bubble that doesnt even catch what's copied 2- offline translation..... I will never understand why this was removed"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The earlier version of this was better as when i copy some text, it automatically translated it and I dont have to select language again and again when i have to go for new translation.

I used the camera setting, I aligned the text, I took a photo and the screen stated ""no Japanese words found."" I then held the camera over the text and it started to translate but it would not pick up the correct words. The items I was scanning were Pre W.W.I Documents. The app translated one word to ""McDonald's "" sorry but last I checked there was no McDonald's in Japan in the 1930s! VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very seamless tap to translate function, for which I installed it. I wish I could set up the tap to translate function to actually show the definition of the word in a particular language (English or French depending on the text) instead of the translation as it is more useful to me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm not able to see my stared phrase verbs in sorted order after sorting phrase verbs by time. My recent stared phrases aren't coming on top. Previous one version was far more better than this newer version in functionality vise. Even translated text doesn't show any type of sign that currently translated text is in my phrasebook or not while it was being shown in previous version.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Not so great for Greek because it is such a complex language and English is relatively easy. A lot of the translations are not as accurate as they could be. Still probably the best app if you have little or no Greek and want to talk with a Greek friend who has little English. Recently changed and not for the better.. Posting to another app eg Messenger used to be simple but now it's much less so and takes much longer.

This app has no app purchases and offline. Nothing bad will happen and it is easier to use because you can also scan the picture or the posted and it will translate for you immediately. and high grammatical. So thank you so much Google Translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Still good. But i suggest that this should have an option to translate from photos with text without highlighting texts that will translate on a type/text box. Instead, translate texts like the instant feature that will see translated text from the photo itself, not in the text box. Edit: tnx for best update! My wish granted!"

It tries to load a ""lens"" web page that doesn't actually load,and then I have to close the app entirely in order to open and use it again. Only typing and voice are working right now which is frustrating seeing as how I live in Europe and rely on this app daily"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I use Google Translate and Papago for all my translation needs. In a recent trip I don't think I could have survived without it. Between the two apps I get a fairly accurate translation. Especially for languages that are less often translated in the US such as Korean or Japanese. Thank you for creating this app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very convenient & helpful!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"honestly useless since the UI update, as well as significantly more ugly. It's become super clunky and only gives you one translation option with 0 context anymore; really I only still have this because it's marginally quicker than opening the browser when I can't think of a word. Won't be downloading again when I change phones next"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Open menu of this latest version is completely different and i think it is not good because it becomes a habit of users so we should not completely different. And sometimes translation does note completed and takes so much time which does irritate and sometimes show massage about internet connectivity even internet connection is good.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App is unable to translate numbers in other languages from English. they should add the same.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are times when Google Translate doesn't listen/record the whole sentence. Let's say I say a Spanish sentence e.g, 'Ella es de España' to be translated to English, I only get 'She is from', where the full sentence is 'She is from Spain'. It only detects the first few words and not the whole sentence. Overall it's a good app and it has helped me quite a lot in learning languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to appear over an app only when I copied text to translate. Now it appears over every app and never goes away. It's constantly in the way. I had to turn off the option to draw over other apps. Then it won't appear at all anymore when I want to copy and translate text. It doesn't work like you said. It worked before. But not now.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not a 100% accurate but it's quite good for a software. I mainly used it to translate Chinese, Korean and sometimes Japanese. For Chinese, the sentences are understandable even though they are not always grammatical correct, same goes for Korean. I can't really say anything about Japanese as I don't use it often"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I shouldn't need a separate app to translate images when the feature is advertised on this very store page. Not downloading a separate app for a feature that's promised in this one.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate feature is destroyed. Has probably to do with permissions in Android 10. But is not important bcs it was perfect and know it's a pain. Is your response a joke? or just a bot?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible upgrade. Tap to translate now only shows Afrikaans as a choice. Also it doesn't work, even when it was set to English. For example, copying any text in WhatsApp does nothing,i delete the app and reinstalled it twice. The second time i restarted the phone after uninstalling it and restarted after the install. Nothing.. same exact problem. Beyond frustrated, i am using a Pixel 6 Pro and have the latest update of Android 12 installed, the minimum i would expect is for Google apps to work"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please bring back the old version or atleast fix the new version! The system doesn't work properly. For example : when I want to know the pronunciation of a word from different region it gives the same pronunciation for ALL languages. Now how can we distinguish between them?!??? There are MANY reviews reporting the same problem. Didn't expect this from Google translate. ""Just that saying we are improving our app"" doesn't fix anything!! Please look over at this issue."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There must have been an update or something because now it just sucks. Like I'm trying to use handwriting input but the box is too small on my phone. Also they no longer show the pronunciation underneath the foreign text. Google translate doesn't need a new UI, it needs better translation capability."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best! I've been watching Spanish (fast language to speak as we knew) clips on youtube and with transcribe, I can definitely understand almost all of the things that the story tells, I just hoped that there's transcribe on iOS too, lucky to have an android tho. The best translator even with the camera but if you want no interruption while watching, just use transcribe and just read it later, this helped me alot."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great but they changed how the tap to translate work and instead of showing the floating button when you copy a text now it wants to keep a constant notification which is really annoying, the only way to remove is deactivating notifications and it renders the app pretty much useless *I saw the explanation of why it was changed but it doesn't change the fact that it is horrible now, Android's recent paranoia with security is rendering a lot of services way worse"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Literally the best app for learning new words right in the context. 🎇Just want to say thank you guys for great job and wish you to keep up the same creativity for the sake of comfortability as you do now. I also have one suggestion for a better using- it would be great if in a an opening window while you copy supposedly unknown word there was a button to add that word in your dictionary right from that window as opposed to open an app and only then add the new word. Thanks 😘

Just one suggestion (want this feature in upcoming update), when I use this app 'Tap to Translate' feature, there should be a save or bookmark button on the pop-up window itself, so there is no need to go everytime in the app. Just tap to translate and from there on itself, a button should be ther - tap to save. :)"

Before the floating icon translator would automatically translate any text on your clipboard if you just clicked the icon, it doesn't do that anymore.

Please bring back the old Google translate!"

It would take longer to set-up your phone but you would do it right and you don't have any worries that something that does a breach of your privacy or something is wrong with your cell-phone that because you have not read on the app you where getting from the app store and just putting it your phone.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very bad transaction efficiency and it can't access the actual its features.., I don't know why it can't do its the best. The Google Translate is not much more wrost reasonably it can translate some quick easy words in some languages and its not providing the actual meaning of a word, it giving the meaning as a result in some errors. So its need some rectifications from our mind or anything else some other third-party apps. So Google translation is not too much trustable app, it have some errors."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new update is terrible. Its not user friendly. Older version is very easy. This one we have to go through 2 steps to translate which is very hard to use. And there is no auto correction like was in the older version. Basically I dont like this update. Its really annoying when using.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The last update was terrible. I speak to Cubans often and data is expensive for them so I always did the translating. Now it's annoying that I don't even want to talk to them anymore.. it takes me so long to reply. Luckily she already had the app and I told her to not update it. Now she has to spend more money to use data to write to me in English. Edit not sure you will see it. But you need to add the language swap button on the pop up translator again

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google Translate is a nice translating app. If you have the latest version of Google you could use the camera option to take a photo of the words you would like to translate and they would automatically translate to the language you choose. This app also provides history and favorites to favorite the translations you like or would like to save.

That's pretty racist google, why can't we get Korean, Mandarin(Chinese) and Kanji/Katakana(Written Japanese Texts)? The diversity the app has now keeps it from 1 star, but it better show more asian languages soon!"

When I translate English to Spanish, the app unapologetically adds a new Spanglish keyboard to my phone?! (basically an English keyboard with the Ñ letter or whatever). How dare you do that?!

Often, there's not a convenient screen location to leave the floating icon while chatting in a foreign language. Just talk to the Android team and get an exception to the clipboard sandboxing. (LG already ignores the clipboard access restriction with Clip Tray, a OS-level privacy nightmare.) Conversation translation is not sensitive enough. Deepl has better algorithmic performance and dict.cc, a more relevant dictionary. Otherwise, ok."

If you gonna tell me re-dowlnloade the app don't because i have redownload it for like 10 times in 3 months. 2) even after enabling the tap to translate feature when i browse through chrome i tap the word no sign of pop-up, so i have to go to the app and start in background then and then only i can use that, so that kind of sucks you know every time to run that in background to use that feature instead you can just use that feature by only tap(wish) it would be really appreciable. I have learnt so much from this app but in our country internet is not available at everyplace so offline translate feature is must, so if you can solve this problem asap it would be awesome for us and please answer back.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New updates suck. No one needs English to English translation capabilities but for some reason after the new update this is the default every time. Before it automatically knew to switch. In addition the keyboard should automatically identify which language is active and switch to that one when input field is active.

I also wish there was a button that you can press each word and it tells you what it is except for just say the whole sentence. More features would be greatly appreciated.

But now the floating icon remains on my display until I dismiss it by dragging it to the bottom of my display. I don't like it remaining on my display. I also don't like having to open my notifications to put the floating icon back. The previous floating icon was more user friendly

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new update makes this app a pain to use - it's way less intuitive and far more clunky. I feel like I'm having to push twice as many buttons to do the same thing as before...I use this app extensively too speak with clients and it's frustrating me. I'll be looking for other apps until you guys figure it out.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"since you connected this app with google you created troubles to me. almost every time when i open this app a message show up with multiple choices... and the history no longer saves anything, every word i write does not appear in history. remove the forced connection between this app and google, make optional and without the current consequences."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I first installed this app, it seemed to be very great but with continuous updates it is getting worse. When I delete the history, it is deleted but it appears again by itself and so many bug issues are there which is literally very annoying. I hope you will fix it. Thankyou"

It's unusual thing, even take more time in translation as before I was like to use when ""tap to translate"" settings on then only need to copy text and then appear a floating icon in screen and just need to tap on this icon and show's results easily I request you pls make setting as before so app will become more comfortable in use Pls fix it very soon"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest update became worst. Worst interface. Every time we need to select new translate for tap to translate. Previously we can just copy the sentence and tap on the icon. It automatically translate. But now every time we need to clear the previous translation then paste new copied sentence. Then what is the use of tap to translate when we need to clear the previous translation every time. Worse update
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Confused about a feature... it was possible to use detect language and the mic feature to identify a language being spoken that someone isn't familiar with, right? I'm not imagining it... it used to work? Now it's not working or not available anymore? Great app, but bring/fix this feature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I didn't like that this annoying notification popped up whenever I opened messages. It asked if I wanted to translate to English from Dutch. The only way I found to keep this from happening was to uninstall Google translate. If I can't easily control what an app does or doesn't do I immediately delete it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It'd be awesome if there's an option in the prasebook to separate the saved words in the languages you want. Many people learn new vocabulary with lists and cards. Why don't you guys create something like that? Please :) Apart from that, everything's fine!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is good, I have been using it for a long time now for my franch learning, but I later on start experiencing errors. Sometimes, the voice translator skips words and type the wrong words. Also, video cameras don't capture the letters accurately. This gives me stress when I am in need of quick results."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's broken. Whatever you did on the last update broke the ability to use voice translate. It won't even launch the mic just immediately says ""An error has occurred. Try again later"". I don't like the new interface either. I want to roll back to the previous version. 😩"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why the hell you always have to ruin good things. The old version was much more better than this new one. Because in old version if I have enabled tap to translate it quickly use to translate as soon as I copy any text. But in new version the floating icon doesn't translate automatically when I copy a text. It just sits up their in corner like a dumb fool . That's annoying. Please rollback this new update get us the old version. Thank
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Newest update is hot garbage. Removed swap button to quickly switch between to and from languages. Removed clear all history button. Removed feature that clipboard auto pasted and translated when you clicked the floating icon, nope you have to click icon, click text field, paste, and then click translate. It was 1000x more user friendly before the update."

I tap the download button next to the language, it says ""Starting download"" and the indicator is spinning, but nothing happens and the language pack is not downloaded.

What I have tried: 1) Clearing cache and data of both the app and Google play (also the services) 2) Unistalling, rebooting and then reinstalling Please give me solution as early as possible"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is AMAZING! We are hosting an exchange student from Italy for the year. She speaks Eng very well but her parents came to visit for 3 weeks. Mom speaks enough Eng to get by but Dad does not at all. Using the translate app we are able to communicate very easily using the conversation part of the app & whatever is said translates and reads out instantly. Also went out to dinner & the photo part of the app translated the entire menu from Eng to Italian. EASILY THE MOST USEFUL APP EVER!!!!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, just leaving the low grade because of the user experience between switching languages. It's ridiculous to have to do 4 taps to just reverse the language. And these taps don't happen instantly either, so if you have to constantly go back and forth between two languages it's really a pain on mobile."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They broke tap to translate again. When you close the floating icon it preserves the translation you previously input. You are now required to hit clear to translate another sentence. Additionally, when you want to translate a new sentence you are now required to ""paste"" in to the application. It's gone from Tap to translate to Multiple Tap to translate. 🙄"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent update is not better than before. In the previous version, when we do copy some words, the Application will translate it automatically. In the new version, we need to open application, paste the words, and see the results. It's getting worse! Please bring back the last feature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good application. It would be even better if we have an opportunity to put saved vocabulary into created files. Also when I click on the saved vocabulary it returns to translator but it doesn't return into pronuntiation and other meanings of the word. It is a shame.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to work so well before they changed it to google lens. Taking a picture, swiping on texts you wish to translate, it was all so easy. Now, it doesnt even detect all the words i wish to translate. I cant swipe on parts of texts i want to translate too. Please bring back the functions from the past!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app no longer works when I'm connected to my Wi-Fi on any of my Android devices. Once I switch to mobile data, the translations appear. I doubt it's my Wi-Fi connection that's causing the issue since the iOS Google Translate works perfectly fine on my iPhone even when connected to the same Wi-Fi network."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This update has been the worst. The handwriting recognition doesn't work anymore. It keeps saying ""internet connection not available"" when all other apps and sites are working, and typed text is working on Google Translate. The speech is also not working and you can't hear the pronunciation of the words anymore. Please fix this"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The translated words are difficult to show to other person. In old version translated words get auto magnified after screen rotation. That function was better then the big type in new version. Difficult to use, older was easy to use and more practical while travelling. I had big difficulty while using it ourside and was irritating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app won't let me delete a single entry without making it too complicated to understand. Removing from all my devices looking for a more friendly app. Not necessary to ""describe my issue in detail"". I've added another app that seems not to have your problems. Also this new app doesn't require internet for the language I most use. Better all around for me."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Earlier, if I copied something, Tap Button would come, and that was very good, but now Tap Button is always seen on mobile skin, which is a nuisance. I want it to be the same as before, if you copy something you will see the tap button and when you translate it will go away ,,,,, you always see the tap button it is annoying and if you copy something you do not see the tap button. I want as soon as possible fixed this problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE the new UI! It's so smooth and simple, everything looks neat and cute!💖 I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH!!💖 - But, would you please add a save ""star"" button for the Tap to Translate option? It would be much easier to save translated words without having to open the app itself. Thanks in advance."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you bother to read any bad ratings you would notice that they have described the problem they're having the Google translation Google just does not care to upgrade it's only meant to listen to your private conversation...THE APP Does not translate very well from Spanish to English or English to Spanish very well make sure you double check before allowing someone to hear or read your text
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the new interface. I however would like to see again the ability to switch to full screen either automatically by changing the orientation of the phone or by clicking a button. To have a full screen mode is really beneficial. Please restore this functionality.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I always use a Cantonese keyboard (G Board) to type transitional Chinese, and it used to be switched to the Cantonese keyboard automatically, when I translate Chinese to another languages with Google Translate. I used to appreciate that auto-switch function, until the latest update. It will change my keyboard to another Chinese keyboard that I have never used, then I need to change back every time, which is so annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've tried using this app to translate hundreds of Japanese sentences and words that I have the English translation right next to and it'll get over half wrong I also retranslated the sentence back in to English if it allows the translation to work to double check and it'll be wrong I can't use the voice section and the scan and translate feture is terrible it's either wrong or you have to scan it 5 times or more to get something decently understandable I have to constantly either leave it alone for a few hours to cool down or uninstall and reinstall I use to love this app but all these problems are getting on my nerves I've tried multiple times to phrases things differently For example when I typed in one man hide and seek or hide and seek alone it came up with hide alone And the writing section when I write stuff I Japanese as accurately as I can it will mess up the simple Japanese characters it gave me in the translation I love this app so much and it would break my heart to be so frustrated with it I have to find a better one
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but I hate the fact that the update makes it keep putting up a notification that it's running! I know it's running, I enabled it! I could deal with a check that we still want it running every now and then, but all the time is really annoying"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please publish your product roadmap. Google accessibility app transcribes. It also translates, however doesn't do both transcribe and translate at same time which is why I had to install this new app. Microsoft translator is better and more real time when transcribing and translating.

It really has helped during some international travel. The image translations seems to be accurate. For the most part, the translations using words seems pretty good."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,God I hate using the translate now. It was the best before this new update.Now I have to copy and paste. There is nothing like tap to translate anymore. You copy text then you have to stressfully paste the copied text yourself which slows down conversation so much. I use Google translate to text my international friends but now that it sucks there is not much to do. I don't know maybe I will have to install other older versions.But if you can make tap to translate to TAP AND TRANSLATE. it'll 👍
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app was good until the latest update. i used to Highlight the text that i want to translate then the translation icon (float) appears instantly.but now i have to choose it to appear or i choose to translate the text without coping what if i want to translate more.that is waste time. ☹ please make it as it was. Tip. I have the latest version of android and apps Please troubleshooting this issue with the developers because this is not the level of Google apps that we used to Thank you.🥰
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Q3 2020 and I went from 3 stars to 5 stars... At least on a pixel phone. You can translate emails easily by selecting the text. Text that is not selectable well now it is. With Android 11 you can select any text from any app by swiping up. And lastly you can translate audio live inside the app. Almost like the app Live Transcribe.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Works much better on my wife's iPhone than on Android. It proficiently translates, that's it. The Android version is slow, has memory leaks that eventually crash it, rarely works correctly when doing speech to text. Otherwise it's ugly and clunky. iPhone version is better in all of those regards"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,By far the best. Kicking myself for not trying this first or sooner. Other apps butchered and pronounced the Spanish translate. NOT Google. Whether it's a real person or a machine; she/it pronounced everything with an accent. Love it! I can communicate with my clients with ease and even they were impressed and I showed them how to get it. Thank you Google!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is used to be very good for translating the text from Screenshot. However after update the new version the image translation or camera translation don't work. I mostly use to translate from Thai to English. Aside that the interface isn't look as nice as the old version.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app. But using the app on top of other apps needs some work.when i use the app on youtube go app after seeing the translation and go back to YouTube go app the subtitle disappear and it needs me to go backward 10 seconds on the playback to restore the subtitle.i want the subtutle remain apparent after i see the translation on google translation app

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently (couple months at least) offline capability got broken. It tells you can't translate without Internet even between English and an installed language .. Worked well before, for years.. Also number of ""favourite"" / recently used languages is too small. I live in Europe and there are many languages I need to translate. You should not restrict it but give the users star button so we can make any language show on top. You multi billion company. Can't you pay a UX expert before making an app?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The fact that there's a character/word limit is ridiculous. What's the point of a translator app if you're limiting the amount people can translate? It just makes it harder to translate things that are over the character/word limit, and leaves people frustrated and having to look for other sources or apps that DON'T have a character/word limit to translate. And those other options may not be accurate at all. Please get it together and get rid of the stupid character/word limit."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest version has one big flaw, you must take two steps to starting typing a new translation, because the Translator keeps the text from the previous translation in, and there is no button to clear it right away, only after you tap into the typing window does the clear button show in the upper-right corner. Please fix this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very useful, however I don't like its tendency to translate into numbers (like 80) rather than words (like ochenta).

It frequently omits the last word or words."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Earlier the tap to translate worked automatically when you copy a text. Now it does not and we have to open the app and translate which takes More Time Hence Increasing the time to translate and understand to reply.

I just need older version or updates that fulfill above stuffs"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What happened to the feature that allowed displaying the translation in big text (esp. Chinese) when you rotated the phone to landscape? I read the other reviews and I see that the new design doesn't have a lot of things. I suspect it's now about being more profitable than functional?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What was wrong with the old version besides not getting some translations correct. Now it's too inconvenient to use. Way too much adjusting to do a simple translation. Who ever decided to change to the so-called ""new"" format, should have the back of his/her hand SMACKED! Not happy with it at all. Newer doesn't always mean better!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Useful, I use the camera function a lot as living abroad. Some translations are questionable though, 'sterkte' in Dutch is like wishing someone strength yet the app says it means 'get well soon', the intent is almost right in that you're being wished well but I was translating a condolences card so was a bit awkward and sad. Generally no problems though and can always just double check for other translations outside of the app in Google search or Wiktionary etc."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I use tap to translate, it automatically switches languages. Example: I do an English to Spanish translation, then go back for another English to Spanish translation and the app automatically switches the translation to Spanish to English. I understand the reasoning behind that, but it's irritating since that is not how I use it and I canstantly have to change it. Could you at least maybe make an option in the settings to not automatically switch?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Newest update sucks. You can no longer save translations. You have to manually close the keyboard which can often lose what you searched. If you click on a related translation and then go back you lose what your previously searched. I find myself just using the browser version instead.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Translate has become buggy. Sometimes when I switch languages, such as when I'm talking to somebody, Google Translate doesn't recognize that I've changed. It acts like a person speaking in Spanish is speaking in English, even when I've changed the originating language. I also wished it included some native languages, such as Navajo. I don't understand why it doesn't allow voice input or output on Haitian Creole."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Once the Tap to Translate feature is turned off it will not turn back on even when it says it's on in settings. I must uninstall and re-install to get it working again. This was a terrific app but now is almost useless. When working it does a good job.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very helpful because I can search for any sentence or word in a blink of an eye. I am learning German and Italian and this is just awesome. and all the words or sentences I want to remember I can give it am special place to save it and retrieve it as much as I want Google Translate I think is a very important tool for people learning a new Language and is free not like Babylon or those who advertise a bait and switch cause what the give you for free it's just Garbage
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is unable to use, the words were extremely clear but the translator just keeps changing the words, we still don't know if it is accurate or not. It's either a splash of random words, different words in 2 seconds or just can't even identify."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Automatically tried to translate in Signal and I approved it. Downloaded the language and translated it and now won't stop trying to translate the language and keeps crashing the app. Had to uninstall it but my pixel somehow keeps trying to translate it and crashing the app. Not good at all.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love Google translate, but the latest update is SO bad I had to come review and leave 1 star. I left feedback and I hope Google looks at all the reviews that have been left in the last week and does something about it fast. With the latest update it really feels like glamour over function, the whole main page is practically a text box, no one needs that, the thing I use most is recent translations to go back and forth making changes now you have to swipe down up type back swipe type it's clumsy."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please roll back this recent update. It's made the app almost unusable. It no longer pops up when you copy, you can no longer edit any typos, it no longer automatically translates what u had copied in the clipboard. Just terrible. The update made a great app useless."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App has lost many key and useful features. It's almost useless now. Suitable for grammar schooler but not adults. Oversimplified. What were you thinking? I searched alternatives and Microsoft Translate looks to be viable with most of the features this app previously had.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new format or presentation of this last update is not easy form me. Have to lower the keyboard manually after translating because it keeps up, not letting see the translation. The layout ia horrible. It makes want to search for a new one and replace it. It's not funtional for me anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When i download this apps its actually good at everything easy to use and learning languages but everything seem kind of problem.

Edit: Now i can download the language back, its not about my internet connection, my wifi is perfect fine, Oh and i change the review star :>"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App needs a update to fix the volume button. If my media volume is off, I used to be able to push the volume button to turn it on and increase the volume. Now I get an error popup that says me volume is off and no way to turn it on. Only way is to go into my menu settings and turn it on."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please enable voice output in cantonese (Yue) immediately. this is available in google text-to-speech since 2015, yet google refuse to add it to the translate app for unknown reasons and keeps on adding other dialects instead. Do notice Cantonese (yue) is a chinese dialect with 80 million native speakers worldwide (from wikipedia). it amazes me why google refuse to enable this voice output when it is readily available. Please explain ."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app was perfect for selecting multiple messages and 2gen I hit the floating icon it automatically translated for me, then I could hit one button and respond in the other language quickly. you completely ruined it now and I have to keep reselecting the languages whenever I need to respond and adds 5 additional steps 😡😡😡😡"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not user friendly. (1) The text writing area is very narrow. You can only see 1 sentence. (2) When you tap the audio button, it automatically turns off in 1-2 seconds. (3) Desktop version is much better. But this app is very disappointing"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Thank you Google, for your email. This app used to be really good. Now has become very slow and very inaccurate. When I type in a word in one language, the translation of the word is not correct and it used to give you the correct translation of the word from one language to another and it used to do it in real time, now it takes a time to think about it before. When I type in a word in Arabic, it now gives me the same spelling as the English word. I'm not sure what else I can say."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using app for years and i learned English because of this application. Now i am feeling i lost one of my part... It doesnt working and always says ""Can't translate"" , ""Check your internet"" PLS FIX QUICK (I am sure all people sometimes have bug and they are giving 1 star and after fixing bug they forgot the change 1 star or delete... This application is greatest <3 )"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My cellphone suddenly entered into a self check mode of sorts and it was completely in Chinese. I feared accidentally pressing a format disk button, as pictures of my thesis are there. This app was a lifesaver, translating from thenChinese on the screen effectively."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the problem is obviously not my Wi-Fi connection if uninstalling and then reinstalling the application allowed it to download languages for offline use again. in this case, an update borking the previously downloaded language and preventing future downloads. which is not how an apk update should interact with legacy downloads. which also means it was not a connection issue if I downloaded the whole app again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After a recent update, why is it we're no longer able to scan and translate an imported picture with words using the camera function to the desired language? It keeps bouncing back and restarting the app when I do so. This so dissatisfying as I often used that method to scan and translate foreign words. Please advise. Thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app lately translate English to Russian totally wrong or skipps words in sentences. This effects the meaning of the translation. I think this error behavior comes after it makes use of Azure services in stead of original Google translator. Go away from Azure services or fix it please. OR use only the original Google translator service for the translator engine. Using Microsoft translation app now, just better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Despite choosing United Kingdom as region under settings, the voice output is in English Indian accent (Since I had chosen United Kingdom as region, shouldn't the voice output be in United Kingdom accent??) This has been really annoying me. Despite choosing United Kingdom or United States as the region under the settings, the voice output is in Indian accent English. Kindly look into this. Plz resolve the problem being faced by me at the earliest. Looking forward to hearing from the team soon."

So Is there any posibilty when we select the particular word it will automatically selected in translated file ?? Rest of things all fine thanks
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I find this to be the most helpful app on my phone. The problem for me is that the offline translations consistently disappearing, making it inoperable. Having to reinstall the app and the offline translations is costly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it ! It does everything that is needed to learn It helped a lot speaker and everything works perfectly no ads and interruptions it is a perfect app it has all languages and everything it's like one of the tools of the steps to learn ANYYY language Its awesome and fun to learn languages with along with O-T-H-E-R PEOPLE TOO Get it right now because it's also not even that heavy for an electronic you DO NOT need WI -Fi For it you can use it Whenever Whereever Its amazing you should get it NOW
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Where did the old detailed translations go to? The app used to give us other options for translations, and detailed explanation and translation for the words we're searching, but now it's just one direct translation, just like any other translation app if not worse. Everything that was good in this app is gone now with the updates, wish I could the older version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poorly designed UI. Limits live data access to Wi-Fi by default, and fails to provide any obvious way of changing this or other default settings, making it cumbersome to use and difficult to configure. Greater thought should have been given to the configuration and user experience for this application, especially considering that it was developed by Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Could the app could get any worse?? 1- Now despite older versions of Android ,on all Android 12s (upwards ) the ""paste"" button disrupts the immediate ""tap to translate"" which is very annoying !!!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is Not worthy of my one Star.. It used to be my best translator before the rubbish update. but now is the worsted translator that i have ever use. Shame on inconvenience the costumer by changing the ability and function of this translator..... If you update keyboard to another rubbish standard, Google should wave goodbye to me. They just lose one customer forever. No aids but why changing the ability and function... Where is full Screen translate captions.. OMG..mtc."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"0-stars compared to a few iOS apps! I was absolutely stunned that this app was so bad. Oh well, Google has devolved . I remember my voice recognition was incredible in 2013-2014, now it had send multiple syllables of things that I never said. So, for me to expect this app to work is a bit pie in the sky."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad update, In the new update When i click on a word from saved words (phrasebook) to pronounce it and then back. Instead of being returned to the place I was at, I am taken to the main screen of the application. And this problem didn't exist in the old version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since this last updated has been appallingly difficult to use. I would use it from Portuguese into english. There used to be a window that will pop up every time you press the copy now there is a window that is constantly there they have screwed up the interface so bad it is almost unrecognizable and it is no longer a seamless way to communicate... As an aside as a business owner.I challenge you never to use Google my business they cost me $1000s Google my business is a nightmare
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A perfect example of change just for the sake of it. Since the update, lots of features are no longer there. I can no longer reverse translate and can no longer write. Or maybe I just can't see those features due to poor eyesight. Strange, as it was a good App before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The New Version of this App is wack you have to restore it back to it's old version ASAP... This new version is absolutely trash it makes communication more difficult... We are in the era of making things easier while you are making your App more difficult... You have to fix this ASAP
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"From my experience every feature with the exception of ""conversion"" worked well for US English to Brazilian Portuguese translations. I'm sure AI will be involved in language translation sooner rather then later if it isn't already. These barriers are being chipped away little by little."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A bug in a recent update really made me realize how much I depend on this app. The app was nearly unusable for a day, and I'm grateful it was fixed so quickly. I live in a country where I don't speak the language and I'm married to a man whose English, although conversational and improving, is not completely fluent. It's a little unusual I suppose, but I wouldn't be married now to a man I love and treasure if it weren't for this app, so thank you for fixing it quickly!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"English to Filipino translation - There are some sentences that need to be corrected as it inteprets different meaning from what has been spoken vs. the translated ones. In other words, it was translated in ""barok""(Filipino term) manner, meaning it was translated a bit odd and awkward manner but atleast SOME thoughts are understandable. Overall, I gave it 3 🌟 since it's easy-to-use and FREE!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App made my phone freeze till the battery died, didn't even respond when I tried to force restart it. Uninstalled immediately after that happened, I can't afford to have my phone brick because they want to keep changing things. (My review was deleted, don't know why. I guess that was the ""developers response"" I was notified about?)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst translator even after being backed by the whole data base of google. Though the connection is good it says 'Failed to connect to google'. Doesn't recognise words appropriately though the accent is indian and with regular pronunciations. Someone please suggest some other app that is better than this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app a lot, but the recent decision to remove the local camera support for google lens has rendered the app useless. My current model of phone runs on android go edition and as a result cannot use lens, and since the primarybuse I have for the app is translatong manga from Pixiv which requires the camera, I'm not sure if I'll be able to use the app going forward."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So I wouldn't be giving this app a one star review without a reason, the reason is mainly that when I go to use the app it dose this thing acting like it works, that's fine, but as soon as I get to the opening page it shuts off the app, like it doesn't work, I have cleared its cache, force stopped it, hell I jest redownloaded it and it Still isn't working, I don't know who else this concerns or if anyone knows how to fix it but yeah, my app is totally broken now, Thanks Google. 😑😑😑"

The old translations can be found in the history; on the upper right press your account, then choose history. Yet, translations are not always correct.

I have read the thread which explains that this is due to security restrictions in android 10, and would say this: If a $1500.00 phone can no longer perform a task which it could last week due to what hackers may possibly be able to do, we may as well stop using technology altogether, because the hackers have won."

Reduced it to three now because the sudden drop of functionality in the camera feature just to push Google Lens is disappointing.

Their response bot couldn't even take the time to see that I didn't say it doesn't work and that the update just sucks now due to It taking out a function. -1 star 🙄
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Old version was much better. This version doesn't translate longer text. Only reason I downloaded this app to translate longer text but now this feature is completely removed for no reason. Please fix this issue and bring back feature of translating longer text.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is good but I'll be more better if there is option for Sanskrit also. There is all languages of india like bengali & many more....... But there is not Sanskrit As it it is also a subject of study so it'll be more helpful for us if there'll be Sanskrit language also. It'll must help us in questions to translate them and in understanding the questions easily............
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"How to make Tap to translate from bad to even worse, from using it in one step to using it in 3 steps to then using it in I guess 10 steps! I am giving 2 stars fot the actual app, but the Tap to translate part deserves no star at all. It is just so unbelievable how all the good functionality is gradually gone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate does not work on Android 10 without permanent bubble. We are not iPhone users. We hate permanent bubbles! Edit: thanks for fast answer but it's not the answer and you can many people are complaining. Line or whatsapp copy directly using their app. So only way is to copy paste in Google translate. And don't tell me it's for security, android is more open system, which is his force even tho has pros and cons for sure."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since the App changed everything takes double. I have to click more than double times to get to the same place. They offer less information when I translate a word. I stopped using it and downloaded the Microsoft one
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Accuracy is still far off in Arabic to English or the opposite. Why is it still so bad and inaccurate? It's so easy to figure out that someone is using Google translator, that's when you know the translator is actually bad and still needs huge improvements to sound natural when translating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ok, but... the voices for some of the languages suck.

Its sickening that a multi-billion dollar company cant take the time to fix the details. 😤😡"

But how can I translate on google messages from english to spanish, that would help alot , my friend s speak English ok and I think it would be nice an easy for them to just speak there native language , plus I'm spanish and learned as a kid but forgot most spanish. No one spoke it when I got older , but it would be nice to learn too. Thanks for making a great free app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's really handy but the latest update is the worst. It doesn't disappear from notification. When you remove it you have always manually open app and check for translation. Earlier it was good, I used to copy message and app opened it."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"3 yrs 9 months later, no change or answer. Translation is great, but I cant for the life of me figure out why this app needs the Control Near Field Communications permission or Read Google Services Configuration. Would have been a 4 rating without Google granting the app excessive permissions that can be revoked. If the user reads the app permissions in the Play Store prior to installing, it appears that the permissions can be denied even though they can not be denied."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this app for many years, but when something as simple as the definition of a word became political, I deleted the app. It was brought to my attention that the FIRST definition of the word ""demon"" is ""a police officer"". It's blatantly incorrect, and there is no place in the app to bring to light this disgusting political agenda. If I genuinely need a definition, I now know that Google Translate is incorrect and pushes their beliefs on users. I'll find a translate app NOT run by Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My phone was running on Android 9 and this Tap to Translate icon runs in background until I copy text then only it appears. After my phone upgraded to Android 10, that icon is always on the screen. That's kinda annoying. Is that because the app not compatible with Android 10? I would prefer it to run in background until text is copied to call it out."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Yes it translates offline but it only reads back in English. It doesn't read in the translated language ever after downloading the language pack. UPDATE: I have tried what was mentioned in the reply but it's still only reading back in English and will only read back in French when connected to the internet.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,After I updated my Pixel 3 to Android 10 the icon of this app is always on the edge of my screen while it should appear only when I copy text to translate.

Before update whenever i copying some words the icon will pop up right away and translate it, after i done it will disappear, but the new update make it hard to use.

I like the old version better. Thanku"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why is the history in reverse order now showing the oldest first? That means most recent is accessed by scrolling from the beginning to today. The more history, the more scrolling. And why put those annoying 'robotic' comments after reviews directing users to feedback? We can all find the feedback page. It seems to be the only available item where 'Settings' should be in the 3 dots top right of each page. Google should just redirect ALL reviews there automatically themselves instead."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You have succeeded to create a mess of the new update. Who's idea was it to change to this new update. Of all the people in that meeting room nobody saw the problem with this new update. How can you suggest that the floating icon should stay permanently on the screen. Did it occur to you that people multitask and the icon just block the screen view. What happened to it automatically popping up when I copy a text. The translation accuracy when you use the floating icon is a mess.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be my most useful app and I loved the tap to translate feature. Not anymore. Now in order to tap to translate I must have all the time this annoying bubble all over my screen, even when I am watching a video. No, thanks. I am uninstalling and looking into other apps"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since the last update this app suddenly uses google lens for the camera translate feature. Unfortunately google lens is garbage and translating isnt working anymore. How come such a multinational manages to worsen apps with each update is beyond me. Interface became horrible as well. Japanese kanji reading in alphabet gone too.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Second time App disappeared from main screen and main menu of cellphone. In the same time Google translator was in the list of apps and capable to open through the Assistant. Above all, dissapeared all of offline language packs."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is terrible and made it impossible to use. Before you could see how to pronounce kanji you couldn't read, now you literally can't which makes the app completely useless for Japanese and Chinese. They also removed a ton of quality of life features"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I liked it so much better before update. I could highlight & copy text/words, the floating icon automatically appeared. Tap it & the translation was there. Now the icon stays on the page & I must paste the text. Change it back, please!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is an excellent app for the o-level language learners, students and the tourist. But, in sone case, it gives few wrong pronunciation etc. Google should try to upgrade this app more for make it a perfect language guide."

I faces problem and glitches for translating any page. I request to the team please update it to older version. If its not possible so there is no more use of this app for me.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Won't translate on screen. Have to keep going back and forth, constantly changing the language as there is no reverse on it. It's just really frigging annoying. I expected so much more from Google. If there is a lower rating I can give, I'd give it. Absolute trash."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favorite app ever as I speak different languages and like to read. Unfortunately, last days the best feature doesn't work anymore.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything was great before the update. Before the update I would give it 5 stars, I would copy and text and the tap to translate was there, now whenever I want to translate something I have to find the app again and erase what I previously put in app. If I want to enable tap to translate I have to go back to settings and enable it, then whenever I want to take it away it disables the app and I have to start all over again. Restore the app to how it was before the update. It was perfect."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google. If you were going to put this un-intuitive skin or interface, at least give us option for keeping the old way.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It does a great job translating but the app is terrible and getting worse. Why do I have to edit and try to scroll a large paragraph in a tiny little box and waste the rest of the screen. The new floating bubble for 'tap to translate' that never goes away when you're not using it was a terrible idea.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to work great, but as noted by many reviewers, the newer versions have introduced infuriating problems with the tap to translate icon and photo features. I recommend downloading and installing the old APK for version 6.4 which was right before Google ruined the app"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The latest two versions of this app are much less useful than in the past. It's like they created a reduced function version add made it the same app. Does not automatically pop up for translate anymore and does not stay on the screen if you want it there.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is awesome. I use it regulaly every day. No ads or popups...i have a hard time thinking of more to ask from it.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use, and very useful. Even lets you translate pictures into text in a different language, like street signs or menus.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"RECOMENDACION! I like it a lot, it has helped me a lot. The only thing is that with the update, they have superimposed the quick translation icon, and it is constantly bothering me. It was better before when you selected a text and it appeared."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant app! I honestly couldn't ask for more, Google translate has helped a lot as a student, it could translate any language through photos, character drawing or text. This isn't any sort of spam bot type of response if you were wondering, I honestly see absolutely no downsides of having this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm so thankful for this app. I host guests from around the world through Airbnb and frequently use this app to communicate. Of course it's not perfect yet but all I need to do is get the gist across. It works perfectly for that. The slightly off translations are more a source of amusement than anything. The guests understand what I'm trying to say and vice versa. Thankfully we have brains that fill in the rest. This is a wonderful tool and I'm so grateful it's released just as it is.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good. Please add the button for copying from the input text box!!! It'd be extremely useful and convenient since I often translate a word to see what it means (obviously) and then want to copy it back to where I wanted to plup it in. It would speed up the process. Thanks!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Last version I was using normally. They updated and now I can't use it offline. It says check your connection even after downloading languages. And the new system is terrible compared to the last one. It was useful and faster than any translator, now it's just been in deep sleep since the new version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Previous version was better Google lens scan is total garbage. Before we were able to mark area we wanted to translate but now it dont have that option nor it can find it by itself to translate. Pathetic. Please revert back or i'm switching to another translator because i live in foreign land.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent App. I am using it frequently and found satisfied. There are two issues I jave faced so far. Editing text box shows only one. If you want to di correction you have to scroll down. Instead if it shows the typed content in four line space text bix that would be great.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My wife is Thai and I am English-speaking and we both usr Huawei smart phones. The new Translate and Maps is just about impossible to use. We often have to use Translate for whole paragraphs of legal documents. Please roll back the upgrade.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fast and accurate and to a great extent, reliable. But I noticed that the pop up that lets you translate instantly is no longer working. Please fix this. And the offline downloaded language should be allowed to work with Gboard in order to help for offline easy translations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always great to have handy whenever you are out and about espically when you are travelling to another country. I love having this app and some of the features including the document 📄/text feature are just outstanding. What I love the most out of all is that there are no ads in this app nor on the website.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App sucks now, used to work so good with whatsapp, now it wont pop up when you copy text from a chat, before all you had to do was copy the text and it popped up and was already in the translation box, now you have to manually paste it and the new UI is very awkward to use."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google translate makes my camera refocus every second. I always take a photo of a blurred text. In every other way - usable, but bugs exist. Update: I have to copy texts into my notepad to edit them, because the tiny visible window visible makes navigating through a text very hard."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible update, integration of Google Lense was unneeded. The apk can't recognize line stops in many Asian languages, basically cutting the sentence in half, the fine text selection is gone, instead we have clunky text base selection as if I'm editing a text in Word. All wrong Google and a shame."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall excellent. The voice/conversation feature still needs a lot of tweaking. The recent update made it more difficult to reverse translate, or switch between two languages. Otherwise, essential tool for living abroad."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have some little suggests. This app should be more friendly on the edit part. When you wanna translate a long text, it is very hard to edit in such a small Strip area, why not let the edit area longer? And one more thing, seems that it doesn't support Voice of English well, a lot of mistakes."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super cool App #tiffanarty approves. I use the scanner, copy and past and verbal tools. You can use it anywhere even when you don't have access to the computer, WiFi or mobile data just download your favourite languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I wrote a weird review before I checked out the app properly and I think I deleted it.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't use it anymore. Every time I open the app, it says ""Can't translate, check connection"" despite perfect WiFi. I also tried mobile data to no avail. Clearing storage every time I opened the app used to work (despite being annoying as heck) but now not even that will function. Yandex time?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app, mostly for its tap- to-translate feature. I do read a lot on foreign languages The only thing I wish tap-to-translate has is ability to see other translations of selected word. Often words used not in the most popular way, so you have to search for the right meaning."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can't see the developer reply anywhere, but thanks for adding back the reverse translate (located in menu at top right) and history (new icon at top). It is not as efficient as the old interface, but at least these vital features are back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new version sucks. Too many clicks needed to do a simple translation. The old version worked a lot better. It had at least the smarts to know I'm translating from English to Vietnamese and vice versa without me having to constantly toggling the language.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Copy texts to translate got worse since last updates. Earlier I used to copy texts whichever I wanted to translate and a floating bubble pops up on the screen, just tap on it to see translation.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The recent update to the translation app is awful. Translating has become more difficult, especially when switching or reversing languages, and translating photos through the Google Lens is absolutely horrible and inaccurate. The search history is also no longer easily accessible"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since, the recent update the floating icon doesn't disappear automatically anymore. This was probably one of the best feature of Google Translate. Now the icon just keeps hovering on the screen over every app unless you deliberately hide it, instead of appearing automatically whenever text was copied. Super annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its truly helpful in many ways. I want to suggest to add a feature in which the floating icon can be opened using smart sidebar in Android 10. It is irritating when it is always shown on screen on notification panel. Having a feature to use it by sidebar would be really helpful
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Should've disable the google lens feature in image translation, or bring back the old scan text feature. The innacuracy and slow speed of translating makes it hard and frustrating to work with. You know what they say, don't fix something that is not broken."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Heeeey get back old version, this version is a bad work, i dont want this funktion, SHOW FLOATING ICON and RUN BACKGROUND😡😡😡😡😡 GET BACK OLD VERSION, this is a maximum uncomfortable, i need copy text, minimize programs, open google translite and paste text, bud old. version after copy text, programs opened automaticli, sorry for my bad english"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use it for several languages. Sometimes it gets the translation correct but many times completely wrong. Functionality is good and it does try hard. Is a great App but needs improvement.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be great. Now the interface is trash, and they've added gratuitous ads you are forced to watch before you can use the app. Already uninstalled. Just use the browser version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The microphone option is just of no use! It always hears wrong then how is it comfortable Or helpful to a user.. I have to rewrite everything even after using mic. I am very disappointed with this otherwise fractures are okay!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update, the pop up translate tap does not work properly. It's so inconvenient. I have to flip in and out of the apps. Taking more of my conversation time on the other side. And unable to use the offline translate even I've downloaded the offline translate. Please fix"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Translate pasted from clipboard"" is a popup if the clipboard has text, but it blocks my camera button for 2 seconds, and nothing has been pasted yet . I do like having the paste button ready but move the popup higher up, just for 1 sec. is enough. This app is essential."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is a life saver if you are traveling. the camera function can translate menus and signs just by looking at them though the camera , and the best thing is that the function will still work if you have no data connection."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Disappointed. It won't open from the icon, I have to go the the google store open that and then open from there. Content is good but what's the use if I can't get to it easily. Developer has updated or fixed and it works as I expected now. Like all the languages it offers."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The translations aren't always correct but it does the job. It's easy to use and navigate! Definitely recommend! Although maybe for someone a little more advanced in the language they're translating so that they don't accidentally call someone a b*tch 😂
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Actually, I like this app, but sometimes it cannot be translated when translating. Secondly, if I want to use a picture to translate, it will not highlight the key points, but will highlight other words. So I suggest that the tool be more detailed. Hope you will improve it.😐"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was better before the update. To only have the choice of a floating bubble constantly on the screen or not have the option to easily tap to copy and translate is not working for me.... and no I don't want to check out your forum to why it changed. Why try and ""fix"" something that's not broken!?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is buggy. It used to be amazing until it updated and the interface changed. It's not user friendly and when I try to translate any language, it just looks like it's loading the translation but kicks out an error."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Are one star reviews now removed? I left a review here, it is gone. I was polite and used proper words. I summed up all the bad things about this update, I didn't have enough space. So I keep it simple now, revert back to the previous version please. Usability and functionality has been reduced to zero. I have no other words for it. Don't fix what isn't broken."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a good translating app especially useful for student. We can easily translate words or even paragraphs into the other language without any difficulty. But it will be better if you fix the camera function. Because it is not working that properly.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app use to be so much better, before I could just go to the menu and select a text message to translate but that feature is gone and it's more complicated. I hope the next time it's updated they bring it back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,please add screenshot shortcut to camera translation screen to save it and read it later (for long documents etc). would be really helpful than struggling to take a screenshot while keeping the phone steadily aimed at a document.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new ver. So bad for translating foriegns languages, return the old ver. It was perfect Where we can select the words separately by highlighting them or as a whole,and don't need to switch to another screen. so annoying and it made translating process slower...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It says that there isn't wifi connection when it's already available. Aside this trouble I can't find the switch ""offline mode"". Another issue is that it doesn't recognize several phrasal verbs and other specific expressions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New updated has turned the design horrible and difficult to make a fast translation and also to read fast. The letters are too big. Really horrible to the point I used google translate for 9 years on smarthphones, and now I am willing to change for other tanslator for the first time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's some error in the app or what I don't know, I'm trying to install it but it's not responding and play store showing me that there is some problem and fix it. So how can I download or install it as i tried to download it from my mobile network and wi-fi network both. Can you fix it or help me to how to i can install it from Google Play Store."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent app when you are travelling overseas. The type to translate you don't need internet but the voice translate you need internet. The camera to text feature isn't very good(I have used it in the grocery store) but it sometimes gives you clues on what the word is.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so sad. Your most recent update ruined this app. The autosuggest feature gets in the way of looking up the words I'm actually interested in. At this point the app is completely unusable. Please tell me if there's a way I can return to the previous version. Otherwise, I'll have to find a new translation app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a pretty diverse app and it has multiple functions however, the app has become very laggy from the latest update. It's a great app but I suggest the technican can do something with the problem. It only happen on this app I guess the handwriting function might have some effects with it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just downloaded for an upcoming trip to Japan, where we are unlikely to have data coverage, so off-line translation is important. As soon as I turn off mobile data and WIFI, speech translation is unavailable, despite having downloaded the off-line translation file, twice! 😕"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So helpful. I use this to look up words all the time and it's so much faster than grabbing a dictionary or googling one. It's really useful in conversing with my neighbors when I don't know a Spanish word and they don't know it in English and charades isn't working.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi team. I've using google translate like everyday. But then a couple of days ago, copy text to translate got some problems. It takes time to launch or never launches at all. I made sure google translate got all the permissions enabled. So I'm not sure what's causing this problem. Hope i can get some support in this issue. Thanks"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Used to be my go-to translate app in China but cannot upload a picture anymore after a recent update. Even with VPN on. Google search reveals this is a common issue. They completely removed this feature. No idea why. Edit: uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing. Hope they patch this issue.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The best part of the app was the tap to translate and the icon used to only pop up when you copy text but now it's always there and you can't get rid of it unless you turn off this feature. Very sad to see it become annoying and useless.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love(d) your app. Use it everyday. It's always been my go to for translations. Now... This latest update has ruined my experience. The size of what I am typing (what I am trying to translate) is way too big. I get that there are people with bad vision.. But I am not one of them. And it is about 7 times larger than my phones font size (the smallest possible size). It's bad enough that people around me will be all up in my biz.. But now I'm sure satellites would easily be as well...lol
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really great app and amazing to use and talk to others. You used to be able to have the floating translate icon pop up whenever text was copied, but now the app says that it needs to be on screen at all times. I don't really understand why but it's frustrating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very useful app for everyone weather student or travel. I was a little disappointed from the last version that the old history used to come first, then the new one came later after through the long scrolling. Then I send the feedback related to this problem and Google Translate response it very soon and launch this new version. I'm very glad that they really took this very seriously. Hats off to Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good but it could use a pause button to allow you to gather your thoughts if you are not quite ready. Over all does the trick isn't always perfect i would say 90% it could use a little AI to work on when you are actually finished with your sentence
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For the most part you can just use the web interface. The app might have a few extra features, but for the most part using Google Translate's website is good enough with out the over head of having an extra app on your device."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason the last update removed the ability to copy a word and have the icon pop up on the side, allowing me to click it and get the translation. Now it hovers all the time and I have to click clear then paste in order to translate. Please go back, the old version was so much cleaner and easier to use."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Photo translation doesn't work with pictures from gallery. Japanese to English anyway. And of course longer sentences are not accurate at all, shorter ones usually are. edit: still no good after reading the manual google sent me and trying in a few different ways to get it to work"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Handwriting input complaint. In iOS this app waits when handwriting is finished. In Android version if you enter a complex hieroglyph, it moves unfinished strokes outside of the focus, making it very difficult to work with. A simple option in settings could easily fix this inconvenience."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most people use a translator to try to wait between two languages. In my cases between English and Spanish. There should be a toggle switch that moves between the two languages back and forth without having to go into a list of languages to change your language each time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Works pretty good. Local slang on some words or phrases is a little different sometimes. Things were going well. Wrote in English- translated to box could have Google tranlate read out or put in text. Suddenly the whole format changed and bbecame worthless.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The older version was the best !! Now its more complicated to use. Will Google translate consider the older version!! As I found it easier to communicate and teach other users in other countries. Now the newest version is difficult
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new version/up date is a catastrophe. Google lense is not to handle. A huge backslash in usability. Also the translation get worse. For example no discerning between masculine and feminin form, lot of basic grammatical faults/errors. The translations were far better before the update"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The camera feature used to work quite well, but since the ""improvement"" it's awful. Instant translate is useless for documents or letters. And when you try and scan it just gives you gobbledygook. Please revert to the old camera, which worked pretty well"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It doesn’t work sometimes. Just buffering happened. Whenever we go to translate it it always stopped work. It's really irritating. On the other side sometimes it's translated some Weird meaning of words. We feel very bad to see this and this is frustrating also. Just fix it. Or it will cause trouble.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am so Impressed!!! The handwriting function is so easy to use than just typing from a different language keyboard and translating which is time consuming Handwriting function makes it so easy now Good job . Once the camera option comes it would be great . For foreign language to English.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, only issue is I think due to the new update; everytime I press the 'conversation' icon, a voice keeps repeating 'press and hold the Google assistant button'. And it doesn't go away no matter what I do. This has made the app unusable for me for now. I hope it gets fixed soon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please, since Samsung j6+ automatic update, the app icon is always there. It does not vanish automatically if not used or after use. When you remove it, it does not appear anymore when u copy a text while it's still enabled in the app settings. Am I the only one facing this issue? What's the way forward?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ive used it several times Works good. Instead of having a notification shade for the floating button there should be an option for translate up where the buttons for flashlight, wifi, BT, NFC, etc. are. In fact if it was there I would personally get rid of the floating button"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The tap to translate option does not pop up the floating notifications on the screen, if it pops up also it doesn't not dissappear automatically. I have this issue after the latest version updated. I and my school, college, University and tution center students would continue to use if this issue is reoccured as before or else we uninstall and move on to get a better translation app. Please help us solve this issue and use the Google translate app like the old version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very happy with this app as you can use it off line, when going away just downloaded the language you need and you off, works very well, even when using the camera to translate what something say, multiple languages to use, well worth giving it a go, and yes I've tried swear words too and does well with them."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New edit: The photo translate is in its worst case now! It can not even recognise the text, what if it wants to translate.... The floating icon doesn't disappear after a while on my new cell phone. On my previous mobile phone it disappeared after I tapped on it and see the translation. But now, it sticks to the screen forever! It's so annoying 😒😒😤"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No accessibility. This app should have pinch zoom on the text boxes. Also, when viewing mandarin translation being able to copy the pinyin would be nice. When show long pinyin using the returns chr(13) to break it up would be great as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The translation features are great, but it would be so much better if the app let me search & filter phrases I've saved by language. E.G. when in Italy I want to only view my saved Italian phrases. Also the sort by Time feature doesn't work, maybe it ignores date, but it doesn't show the most recently saved phrases in any order."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,By far the most incredible app. Some features are really futuristic like using the camera for instant translation or using a photo where you can select which text to translate! It is pretty accurate in almost all translations and builds a bridge to knowledge for younger and older people. A must have in all cellphones
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New version is worst for folder option. Why do you keep on changes? If you are changing it should be better while I have found now a days your Updation is worst. Earlier option was available for folder and later you can choose files but now no option for folder
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, but the new interface is horrible. You can't see your translations without removing your keyboard, you can't translate backwards to check the translation, and your history isn't available in view."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It used to be brilliant, however in spoken text it now misses the last word or two. Which often can be the point of the conversation. Recent update hasn't addressed the issue. Microsoft translate doesn't have the problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am not a fan of the new design. Functions I rarely use, like transcribing or conversations are too emphasized, access to translation history is easy but not indicated at all and most critically - as a student of Japanese I don't understand why you cannot resize the hand writing space."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My daily routine app for transalating every single messages and unknown words.its also a helper of mine.it gives me instant transalation over pictures and also get transalation of taken text pictures.i am recommending Google Translate forevery persons/individuals for there any transalating purpose. I am facing a issue that i cannot getting tap and Translate in my vivo v7+,plz fix that in next update,hopefully."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mediocre translation app, completely ruined by the giant blank space below its single line of search bar. Since I often translate entire sentences or paragraphs, I find it infuriating to have to continually scroll through my text line by line, instead of being able to see it in its entirety on the aforementioned blank screen."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new version is annoying! When comparing translation in different languages i need to say or type the whole thing again! And i can't go back and forth between the meaning of a word ant conversation... please give us the ability to go back to the previous version.. please
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You guys completely ruined the app, with latest version automatically paste doesn't work (while Tap on translate is on) , before it auto paste instantly just by tapping on floating window icon and now each time I need to manually paste each messages and wait for translate , that makes it even more slower while chatting, kindly add that auto paste same as previous version and it would be great if you'll also include langauge swap button within floating window for more instant response."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Flipping needs work. On the translate website, switching between languages is smooth. Indonesian text translated to English, when you hit the switch button, the Indonesian text stays though now it says English. Website doesn't do that, switches fine/smooth transition"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Auto conversation mode does not work with the headset on. Why is this? I bought the pixel a buds just for that. It seems like it would be simple to just send the audio through either the headset or the phone depending on which language was being spoken. Other than that, it works all right. Needs more spoken word translations though. Like I have customers that are Bosnian and it's hard to speak with them because the app doesn't allow them to speak they have to type what they want to say."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"why does the ""enter text"" field only display 10-20 characters at a time? it makes it difficult to paste and edit long sentences and paragraphs. Also, for Japanese translations, the app won't allow me to view the entire romaji translation; it only displays about 30 characters."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is not a special one. Just a translator app. But camera, handwriting, conversation,voice features are useful. Anyway, good work. I think most of the people get knowledge from it. It can detect languages. From 🇱🇰..."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The same as recent reviews. You destroyed every good thing about this app with the latest updates. It is about 10% as useful to me as it used to be. Really inexcusable to completely remove features we have used for years. Edit: App has been updated again and it's SO much better!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Appearing translate button afer selecting a text was a competitive advantage comparing to iPhone. Translation could be done with one click. Now extra steps added and you are on pair with Apple on number of steps needed to tanslate. Well done, if you are trying to push more people to iPhone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cannot be moved to SD external storage. This is totally a waste. I'm travelling through Europe and Asia and I've downloaded about 10 languages for offline use. All this storage uses my main memory but I also have an external SD card which could be used. Please Google improve your app and make it movable to SD along with all its data
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update January 31, 2022, has ruined this app. How can I get the previous version back? It is difficult to tell if new translations are copied or not. You can't see the whole version of each various version -- to differentiate between them. So user-unfriendly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very handy and seems to be increasing in accuracy of simple sentences. Especially like the ""copy"" feature that pops up a window for instant translation. Use it often. Off-line seems to be improving - used to often not work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to enjoy the scan and translate the word, that's the previous version. It was great. But after the update, the new version is ANNOYING because I cannot scan the targetted word. I am thinking of uninstall it, unless you bring back the scan facility"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The text editing area is way too small. It's tiny and extremely frustrating since the rest of the screen is completely empty. Additionally, the new implementation of tap-to-translate sucks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good only for a small sentences or a couple words. But when you try to do a entire paragraph then it crashes. If you don't text the entire sentence or paragraph then it won't translate correctly
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very impressed with the amount of vocabulary in various languages. I found I had to alter a few words here and there but otherwise super useful. Had a Chinese lady approach me at a train station in Denmark who needed help buying a ticket. This app allowed her to speak and get the point across and I was able to write back in English for her to read in her language. A few layout improvements would make this 5 stars!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google translate is my common use app, but after the new update, the interface become not user friendly, is not straight forward, the text input area is taking too much space, which sacrifice the history area. I hope the UI/UX team can reconsider the user experience for this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,After the latest update translated text not always appears in history. If you swipe an item from the history a useless snackbar partially hides the last history element. Keyboard doesn't change it's language automatically anymore as well. Screen space isn't used quite rationally. The history has inverted order for some reason
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wth? All of a sudden camera translate turns into Google lens and instant translate is gone as a result. Now I have to take a photo every time to have some texts translated. Google is yet again trying to get more data out of users at the expense of app functionality and users' convenience. Uninstalled.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Contibuting can only be done outside the app. No choice for keyboard in latin/cyrillic/kanji/etc. No option to vote for the right translation when multiple translations are shown. It looks like an abandoned project, that's simply piggybacking on some old machine learning project."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Work great very handy to be able to communicate effectively and make yourself easily understood... It amazing what you can accomplish one or two sentences at a time... Was able to help a new New Zealander set up his internet provider using Google Translate & it was simple to get answers to all the questions required to set up an account... Highly recommend this app if visiting a non English speaking country... and I'm sure it works well for other nationalities though I can't attest to that....
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app used to work great. Now, whenever I use the tap to translate floating feature it creates a new circle every time I translate something so that I have multiple copies of the icon on my phone screen. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I will be uninstalling this app as there is no option to change to a male voice. MANY languages have masculine and feminine words, verbs, phrases and pronunciations. Not allowing for for more than one gender is shortsighted at best and usually rediculously confusing. I shocked and disappointed in that huge and OBVIOUS miss."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please bring back the Old Version, new update lacks many good features which older version had. This new version is difficult and inconvenient to use. Some features I like In older version, Keyboard automatically changes according to the language I select and also I can easily switch languages to see translation in different languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The best thing about this app was the Tap To Translate feature. You copied a text and a bubble came up and all you needed to do was tap it to translated what was just copied but now after updating to Android 10, the bubble is either there all the time or not at all. I don't need that bubble there all the time... It's useless now"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As I understand, google is transforming it's apps one by one: first calculator, now this. While new calculator lacks major functionality, translate is working fine, although any new text is too big. Nice work, but previous version worked fine. Don't change anything that working without any issues."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I need help! My phone asked me to update this application, and when I did the update, everything changed. I used to be able to turn on translate and play a two-hour recording video, and it recorded everything nicely and translate, but now it stops after 1 minute. Is it possible to somehow re-record 2h?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"From what I call tell this app does a good job translating from English to Spanish, which is what I use it for most. Truthfully I have never used it to translate into other languages other than Spanish, but I have never had a problem with communicating back and forth with Spanish speaking acquaintances of mine while relying on this app to translate for me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I recently had two experiences where I needed to use my 'Google Translate' app'. The first was when I needed to assist the police with an incident I was involved in, and the second when I went to hospital for an operation. Without this app' my situation would have been near impossible. I am very grateful to 'Google Translate' for providing this service."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The fonts are WAY TOO BIG. Please give me an option to revert back to the old font size. If I need to type a full sentence, it is not possible to see the original and translated text at the same time. I use this everyday -- I am looking for a replacement."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Life saver! Live in Costa Rica but don't speak Spanish. Vital app which does more than meets the eye. Like using the camera option to read a sign or even translate an entire page typed in a different language. Constantly use it to translate my texts into Spanish before sending to a local. Awesome!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Prefer the older version. Has a history of translated words that can be reuse. It's hidden and need to open up another page now. Not convenient for user. If there is option to revert to older version. I would gladly choose it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new update changes some feature and it is for the worse. Now the translate image no longer could read file from SD card. It is also very janky and annoying as now you can't simply tap the words and hear the audio. I hope the developer fixes this or just bring back the old UI
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is free of charge yet. Too often, the according database does not know advanced words in ie. German & simply pastes the (ie.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,What is the point of downloading the offline translation when you can't use any of the voice features. The one reason I downloaded this app was for the voice features being able to use the conversation mode but when you're offline you have to input the text for everything
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google pixel XL 3 - whatever you guys did you messed up the Pop up bubble. It should only popup when I needed a translation after i copy. Now the pop up bubble stays on all the time and you can't minimize it. Stop responding with a generic cut and paste response. it's the same problem that everybody else is having and dragging down your apps rating. By the way, you keep responding to everybody with a link that we can't click for a the redirect."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Could you make it easier to access or open the Tap to Translate. I still need to go deep in the settings. Really good. Just hoping for some prebuilt phrasebooks like that in Microsoft Translator. Maybe you could also have a better floating over another app interface.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is actually great. But i want a update where the saved phrases in phrasebook keep popping up as notification on notification bar, the frequency of popping up as notification can be user selected. I really use the translator to learn Japanese and its great. Just the bad thing would be that all translation is in formal japenese"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for years and the new display feels so strange. Most of the time when I use this is to handwrite and translate difficult kanji I read online. The handwriting function used to already be there when I open the app, now it's like I have to search for the function. Very confuse with the new version."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Always appreciated this app's effectiveness, which got so much better with its AI. However it's definitely visible that it's made by English speaking people, lacking the most basic feature : showing the genre of nouns for single word translations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Works awesomely the times I've ""really"" needed it to. Like at work when a customer only speaks a language I don't understand. Then I can use the conversation ability to communicate with them.

My mobile is a Sony XA1 Plus, using Android Oreo 8.0.0 last updated in August 2019, and not updating thereafter. Makes it impossible to operate.

My Norwegian skills improved a lot.. There was a quantum jump in just 6 months... Norwegians used to praise me a lot.. And i was extremely happy with their feedback on my new language skills.. Even my husband was quite impressed.. Bcoz he couldn't learn Norwegian even after several attempts.. 😊🤗❤️

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best translator I know. To expand the translator's capabilities, it would be necessary to do: 1. The ability to edit the source text and the translation. 2. The ability to see the text on the screen during a phone conversation (for people with hearing problems)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since the latest update speech output in not available for a number of languages that I would make use of. Seems like a lot of useful features were removed in favor of simplicity which is super counterintuitive for such a useful app. Will be looking elsewhere for my translation needs.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Be very careful when using an English to Polish translation and vice versa. This app will often give a completely inaccurate and / or incomplete translation. I'll give a much better ranking if I see vast improvements. Currently, Google translator is average, at best."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's..not bad I guess? But it's definitely not exactly 'good'. I'm no kanji expert or intermediate but I know enough to get the gist and this app very much did not. Even I knew my shirt didn't say anything close to discussion or talk.. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for translating your Weeb shirt. Otherwise it was ok until it crashed literally after I got my 'translation' and it wouldn't let me open it.. 2 star overall but extra for effort and because I felt generous.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever you guys did just completely ruined the user experience. The app will no longer be a go-to for probably the majority of people, since its pic-to-text tool is now comparable in functionality to a physical dictionary — which is to say it's nonexistent."

Note: I gave voice input for tamil sentence."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Tap to translate now displays a permanent bubble on the screen.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I don't know why this app doesn't have 5 stars. The best translation app in history. It has camera translation which is useful when traveling. Scan text and translate which is useful in projects. And just the normal type in the text box and translate. The new update made the app experience 10 times better.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version of this app is not useful, handy as much as old version. Copy, paste, change language preferences were much easier for old version.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very impressive app. Please autocorrect should not be active during app usage.

I know Burmese has been added to google translate on the web, but is not yet available in the app. When I can use it with my students from Myanmar (my second most common population of non-English speaking students) then I will increase the rating.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Brilliant. Couldn't do without this app. Use daily while reading and watching TV in my non-native language Spanish. A back up for learning rather than using my dictionary. Quick access out and about. Voice translation is excellent when I need to check I have understood. Highly recommend.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is not user friendly anymore. I can not choose the language for the mic and it always detect the wrong one. Also the new update is missing the fullscreen option. It is suffering to switch between languages.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't even get single words correct. You should at least use an official dictionary for single words. Follow-up: Yeah, I used ""Suggest an edit"" a lot. But most words didn't get updated after my my suggestion. It should updated at least for me if not for other. I eventually give up because there are just too many bad translations. I am not even talking about complicated sentence, just single words. For example, I enter ""denigrate"" for English to Chinese and I ended up with ""ig毁“. It's not even fully Chinese. I have seen many this kinda of cases. I know you are probably doing some fancy big data algorithm, but you should just use an Oxford Bilingual Dictionary or something for simple words like this."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New version sucks. No longer keeps a history of past translations. Interface style has changed for no good reason although I could live with that, if you didn't remove useful functionality as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The transcribe feature sucks. Before the conversation is even done, it stops recording. And if it does record something, it only records just a line or two. Worst feature ever. Might as well have not included it."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is no option to choose a picture from the gallery analyze text and translate! Lame! ....... Update: Interesting fact! It does give you options to acces gallery and choose a photo to translate but, if you are in China, for that option you need to use VPN! Once you turn off the VPN, the option disappears! I wonder why is it like that since Google translate works without VPN in China. Why that option requires VPN ?! I don't get it. It's not logical to me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I use it a lot. It has improved greatly during the last decade. Of course you have to check the results which requires knowledge of the target language. It appears to always go through English when translating between other languages...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, except that it doesn't translate many words correctly. Also, voice input is not available for many languages. But then too, it is a great help. I am rating it five stars because this app has helped me to improve my vocabulary and language skills very much. Whoever is reading this review, I assure you that you can download this app without any doubt. Thank you."

However if I dismiss the bubble it's gone until I go and disable tap to translate then re-enable it. It's pretty annoying, the bubble used to always reappear on its own."

You can hire me, I can do bad usability design for less money, easy... do you have any recommendation how to translate chat messages (Facebook, WhatsApp etc.) with ""tap-to-translat"". But without annoying forever floating icon on my screen? There's no popup (appearing) menu, so there's no ""translate"" option. Just ""copy"". Would you mind to let us use previous version, please?"

That's why I downloaded the app. When the app give the same character 6 different translations that don't match what I was able to look up, there's something wrong. Directing people to correct translations is NOT the solution."

I have a really good internet connexion but it's won't translate. it's says that I'm offline. Even the offline files that I downloaded are 1000% false. They don't make any sense. I hope you respond and give me a solution asap"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just change it back! Joining what is obviously a wave of irritated users. I don't know why you changed anything. I have been living abroad for 5 years. Google translate was my rock. Now it's next to useless. Why in the world did you remove the ability to copy text and have it automatically translate? At least without having the little bubble icon always on my screen. How annoying! What a choice. Uselessness or irritation. Now I cannot even figure out how to turn the annoying option on...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very Nice app but sometimes the translation not proper...it totally changed the word definition..about transcribe option there is lag something... you have to add words that we speak that time ....it is that word or not.... how to specifiy the correct one with other language words that we know which word what mean ?.....might be this option you'll get better improvement. Thank you.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to work really good with copy paste + bubble. Because of limitations, the bubble worked a bit worse because it needed to be there constantly. I removed it and used the notification instead, pretty ok. But now with new update.... The bubble keeps coming back! Please remove it, I don't want to have to disable it for every translation I do. Bad UX."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was way better before the update. This downgraded rather than upgrade, i wish you would bring back the interface before. I can't even use the speech translation. It now sucks. I might have to look for other translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Recently stalls at times and won't provide translation. Need to turn wifi on and off to prompt it to provide a translation. All other data services are functioning. Used to work all the time every time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good but I hate it when they do not translate exactly what you have written, they help you add additional words or change words to give it the same meaning but in another way and understanding. They should try to translate exactly what the user has written without helping them to add additional words or Changing words to another (e.g. Changing Engineer to mechanic, changing 'Dear' to 'My dear') in other languages"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would have given 5 stars before the most recent update, so I feel a bit bad leaving 1 star here after it's been so great for so long. I purely leave this review here in hopes that Google changes this app back to what it used to be like. Before, the app would automatically change my keyboard from Japanese to English, but has since lost this feature. Also, if I didn't recognize a certain kanji, the translation would show the hiragana. Unfortunately I'm out of room on this review to say more."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's unusable for quite some time. Upon typing the wishing word for translation the app just acts as if there's no internet connection and does not give the translation. I have to close it, erase it from recent apps for few times in order for app to start working normally."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad design UI. The text box for writing is too small to write down kanji. Really sucks and not comfortable. Edit: getting worse and worse, now the capture with camera to read kanji with google lens is really difficult to use. REVERT IT, PLEASE. I JUST WANT MY OLD VERSION OF GOOGLE TRASLATE!!!. Since the UI change it become horrible app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine, however voice to test translation is still imperfect. I say one thing and it gives me a different translation.

Gonna switch to older version of the app. Am I getting old to dislike tapping twice for action that previously was one touch only?

It's okay to using the camera tap pause and take picture but it's almost unclear when you zoom in and when you are going too far like a paper it cannot see the word I mean. My device name is Honor 8X.

I want to edit the text in A before translating. But the app gives a prompt for 2-line length and I have to scroll through it and find the exact word which I want to edit. It's a bit hectic. You can allow another screen where we edit peacefully and say ""confirm and translate"". Update: thanks for implementing my suggestions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Completely changed. No longer as affective functional. Simplified it to a fault and it's much much slower. I've never seen such a severe downgrade from one of the best translating apps to actual dogwater in a bowl on the ground.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutly sucks. You can only translate very very short time, rediculous!! I was trying to translate a video from another source. It was a few moments of a Chinese woman pleading for help because the Chines government was taking her children, and going to beat her and her mother. It had something to do with the covid virus, but I will never know the complete story because of the frustration. I have seen the Chinese app work flawlessly. Google should be embarrassed or maybe copy from the Chinese."

Instead of having to scroll through all of the different ones they offer. One way they could change this is having your downloaded languages at the top of the list in ABC order. If they added this I would update to a 4 star. Please consider adding this. This simple addition would help language learners like myself and others. 💯

We meetup in person and turns out, she doesn't speak English haha She was just using this app to talk to me and I wasn't able to tell the difference. Long story short were on our 5th date now and I'm getting pretty good at Spanish and she's getting pretty good at English and it's all thanks to translate"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for a long time and this is such a good app, .It is best when i have to translate hindi to English. The history of sentences or words is shown below and that was very convenient to check whenever I want. But now I'm upset because you have created a new version and it's totally different from the previous version. just want the previous version. Latest version of this app very bad ,pls get back the first one🙏"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Turns out there are some issues, the tap to translate button sometimes doesn't show up and rather than admit ignorance the AI will make extraordinary extrapolationary leaps, gibberish can turn into intricate advice on venture capitalism. / Excellent! Translating Kinyarwanda where words have complicated conjugations that stump other dictionaries but google translate is spot on, even when words are misspelled!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"6.2 is an improvement. The floating icon is back, but it is persistent... Can be turned on/off via the notification. Not nearly as convenient as the pre-Android 10 functionality, but usable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somewhere along the way, you managed to update the ability to scan and import text to translate out of existence. Very frustrating, app keeps crashing when I try to scan something."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app literally made it possible for me to do my job effectively. I work as a Home Visitor and have to communicate with Spanish speaking families weekly and do not always have a translator. This app is so accurate and I could literally see a huge difference in the disposition of one of my parents. She was much happier when I came to the home yesterday and our visit went much smoother. I'm excited to go back and continue using this app with my families.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was perfect till the recent past. Galaxy S21 experiance: it is always floating icon unless it is hidden. Useless and very annoying! Pls return it like it was.Selecting the text there is other dictionary available. Pls make Google translate as an option or icon should appear by pressing the copy selection. You recommended to hide it and use app notific.icon when needed. Notification line should be always clear. If it is not, there is sth I have to take care. Transl.app icon shouldn't be there."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The recent update regardoing the tap to translate feature completely ruined it for me. It's a nuisance and I've been using it for less than a day and it's already been so inconvenient. I doubt you would (or could) change it back too...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"5 star on * two/three yr old* Samsung phone, 0 points pixel. Either i have a constant message in the top bar on pixel or not - don't want the notifications all the time but i don't want tap to translate to disappear? completely wrong headed and stupid decision - surely on a Google phone it should be even more intuitive? Genuinely considering sending my Pixel back based on this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This version is unfriendly to use. I still prefer the previous version. I can copy the text as well as the pronunciation to help me to communicate later on. And there was history also from the previous version. Please include the above in your coming update. Thank you.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good for word to word, but does not translation the whole context well my experience was with english to in Spanish and Arabic( especially Arabic or opposite. the microphone/ voice recognition, can handle one word, I can use it to for a whole line or paragraph ( I have to type)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Idk if it's gotten worse or if it has always been pretty bad, but I just tried to translate a short Japanese comic and got basically nothing out of it. My very limited knowledge got me further than this app. I remember the import/highlight to translate working better before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Perhaps 4 star. I have been using this in other app mode..all works just fine. Maybe all i cover is 2 or 3 language translations numerous times if not too much to say of. But, not the app, the website via copied app link. So for the app no experience just yet. The way i see it, they are very same thing practically. If u want tranlator app to feed you food with spoon, you are talking about A.I and robotics 2070."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not happy anymore with this new UI. Whoever needs translation that means English is not mother tongue. And will be always continue to learn maybe the whole life. I used to use Google translate app only. But I think should looking for another application onwards. My vocabulary list lost since years after new version updates. Google translate isn't just a translation tools. It's also kind of a vocabulary memory store.Can't go back to study those words I translated randomly. now it's all gone. 😔
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app since I bought the mobile. And it works very well, but the interface of the new version is not good and can't work properly. The interface of the older version was great and it was easy to work with. Old version is better than new version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was a decent app at one time, but keeps getting worse! Hate the institution of Google Lens. Insert changes in Settings to turn off Lens and/or take the app back to a usable version and I might reinstate a few stars. See if you can fix it Google. Just another case of the programmers justifying their jobs."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Material You is the worst thing that could've happened to Android, this new redesign is horribly unintuitive, unaesthetic and unnecessary. AND BEFORE YOU COPY AND PASTE YOUR PRE-MADE ANSWER AGAIN; NO THERE ISN'T A THREE-LINE MENU ANYMORE! IT'S BAFFLING HOW A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY IS SO BAD AT BASIC THINGS."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have an idea to improve the app even more. It would be easier and faster if we could ""favorite"" or ""pin"" languages so that they're always on the top of the language list, instead of having to search for it by its name again after translating from a different language that isn't used as much. I hope you understand what I mean."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this was the perfect app.and working fine but it has now stopped working on Android all i get is an error message when trying to use the camera. Have tried to reinstall a few times to no avail. A shame as it was a really good app. thanks to the very quick reply from the LCC team this app is now working perfectly again. i would definately reccomend its brilliant
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Meh, I'm not even sure it translates text correctly, because I have gotten some wierd looks from some Japanese locals when I show them my text. The pictures setting is even worse, it changes as my camera angle changes and sometimes, not even into to English."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a bad version. The previous versions were better than this version. Especially floating icons show automatic pop ups. In previous versions, floating icons would pop up automatically when copying any text. Give me back the old design."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The microphone icon is for short phrases. To begin, pause, and continue longer phrases use ""transcribe"". I find the one scrolling line for typing and correcting limiting. Other than that I've found this app useful for messaging others in numerous countries. In a word...invaluable"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It adds spaces that aren't there, changes punctuation, and omits words. A quick google search turned up people complaining about this same thing as far back as 2016, and the was just the fist page of results. That's 2 years that google has either been unable to figure out how not to add spaces, change punctuation, and omit words, or they're already getting my data and they just don't care. If they are unable to correct this, it means that they're only hiring morons to work on translate. which would mean that they don't care.You suck."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In my suggestion is to add a new feature ""history"" to save my searching strange or intricate words. It would be helpful for me to memorize those words. I often use ""tap to translate"" this feature helps me alot to translate strange words when I read articles in flipboard. But unfortunately, this app will be more helpful for me if this app would provide or add a new feature ""history "". Because when i open this app, my previous searching words is not tracked in the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the new interface is horrible, before you were given automatically many possible synonyms of a word but now its just terrible, bare bones and goves nothing of value against other translation apps, change it back or let us download the older version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The font size for the conversation are way too big. Whose idea was that? Please revert back to the original. The tap to translate also now very horrible, previously it was easy to use, now have to tap many thing just to get a simple translate. Very horrible."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Why the instant translation option of image and text has been removed. It was the best option of this app. What does the Google Lens means really. Why has the instant translation option been replaced by Google Lens? Thanks for your reply, the instant translation was very helpful because it displayed the translation on the same image Thank you very much. I could use that option just now. It feels good"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"On OnePlus 5, this app started truncating voice recordings back in 2019. Other apps that use Google translate services work fine. I stopped using it for voice. It chops either the beginning or end of the phrase. Fine for text, hence the two stars."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the older version and would gladly give it 5 star but unfortunately this new version is very irritating. It doesn't paste automatically on floating mode like old version and it never detects any language. This new version is very complicated, the old version is much more better than this"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Works like a charm but the new UI is downright dumb. People rarely use the speech option (as I'm also reading in others' reviews), why make the button do big? Please revert to the previous layout as it was more intuitive. Also don't tell people to give feedback on the app because there's no way to do do without jumping through a bunch of hoops. Learn from the feedback here, thanks."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's an OK app, some languages aren't on point, and how I know is I tested it with Portuguese, as I am a Brasilian man myself, and caught a few off phrases. Now you can't even go offline with the app to translate languages, and soon I will be uninstalling this and finding something more efficient and precise. Fix this or I may just give it 1-star for ""Unsatisfactory, and mispronouncing a lot of phrases that I have tried to learn off this like (Japanese, Arabic, and French) Thank You!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Being British unfortunately my ability to speak other languages is some what lacking! However with this great app I'm able to speak to people and more importantly understand people from other countries!! One of the few advances in technology thst benefit our lives rather than make them more difficult!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new layout is horrendous and ugly and not user friendly at all. It takes me 10 minutes to translate a single sentence now because none of the buttons are in an easily accessible place anymore! Rolling back to the old, much better version. Fire whomever designed this update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new UI is terrible. Bring back the old one that simply worked. Also show more than one option. Your one option is often not the correct one. If I have to install a dictionary in addition, it means something is very wrong with the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If it wasn't broke, don't fix it. The previous UI was an ideal translator app. Very simple to use. I miss the rotate-the-phone and the translated work is enlarged on the screen for the person to read."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A reliable,simple to use translator. It can even work offline if you install the language (of your choice!)

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bring back the audio playback! It isn't much help to only view translations. We need to be able to play an audio to communicate. Handing over our phones to strangers for them to type a response is ridiculous!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"With all the bug fixes and recent tweaks, this has become just a fantastic app, and for some an essential app. Very easy to use and very fast at what it does, especially if you have a fast or even mid-range phone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In a previous version I used to have the ""tap to translate"" feature appear only when the copy feature was triggered. I don't want the bubble showing on my screen the entire time and there's no option for me to change this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app worked really well until today. It suddenly updated and the font size is enormous. I don't know how to make it smaller and it really doesn't seem like i can use it when half of the screen is occupied with around 10 words.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible Horrible Horrible ""upgrade"" RUINED an app that I used every day. And it wiped out my entire saved history. I was using it for 4 languages now I can't use it at all. Also, they keep deleting my review! Forced ""upgrade"" destroyed app. You MUST make the ""classic"" app available. Everyone has been begging for the old app since ""upgrade"" Please restore my extensive saved history and restore the app to what it was. New translations vulgar, crude. Disgusting filthy & embarrassing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is really great application. However, I gave only 3 stars, and there are few compelling reasons for that. First, it is not translating whole sentence grammatically perfect. Second, some words' meaning is not correct as per cambridge University press dictionary. I would suggest developer to study Cambridge dictionary's meaning and put those definitions in this application. It is really easy for you guys."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google, the UI design is good. Great, in fact. But, ugh, the translating part is... lacking. Can you please add the old way of translating into the new one? Because this new update is hindering my efficiency in translating long text. If you can consider this, thank you."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,.. .I tried this app 4-5 Times but it doesn't work properly. Whenever we are trying to transfer it from Marathi or Hindi to English it is not giving proper sentence. Google has to work a lot on this app. If I would compare Google translator with Microsoft translator then Microsoft translator is very good and translating the sentence properly

""This app won't work properly untill you allow Google play services to access the following: Calendar, contacts, microphine, phone, sms."" 😱👿🖕 While all other google made apps and google play games work fine even with google play.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are some issues. They do occur quite regularly, but all of them can be solved by following steps written in the support article. It just gets a little annoying sometimes. The app really helps me in my learning - especially the phrasebook thing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good and useful App. Arabic translation is very poor (even wrong in the image you show 😆). The place where text can be written is quite narrow and can't be widened! This is irritating when trying to correct words :(

Thia app is there where needed"

It is unusable for me now. I am here on the play store looking for an alternative. .. EDIT Ok so I saw a Google response below. Settings menu is accessed through your ACCOUNT menu... Why?????? Lol. Ok so tap to translate is still borked. It does not automatically translate... You need to paste the text .... Why? Still looking for an alternative.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting worse and worse. First tap to translate became permanently on screen and not appearing when text been copied and disappears on it's own when not being used.

Why do you have to take working things people depend on and try to jazz them up in ways nobody wants and in the process make people less interested in your products and fearing ""updates"" which are synomonous with bugs, and stupid UI"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Who decided on this change??? This sht is ugly and dmn near unusable. The old design was simple and straightforward. Gave you different options when the translation didn't quite fit and was just easier to work. Stop fixing things that aren't broken. No one needs a neo gen look to a translation app

If the organisation had conducted any customer research, it would not have recommended the new update. Please bring it back!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its a great app except when translating it is to quick to stop! It doesn't taken into consideration of natural speaking which consists of slight pauses which the translator takes as finished and when continuing previous conversation information is deleted which doesn't help!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so frustrated after update this app. Please just bring back the old version. Thr display is not comfortable to see. The text is too big and it is so difficult to operate. This app is so useful for me, but after use the new version I can't use it comfortably again."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use tap to translate. It's always floating on my screen. I still prefer and think papago app is the ideal translator for Asian languages. Google translate requires too much tapping to get something translated. It doesn't always translate Asian sentences correctly. The floating icon is also too big.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"well, it's not amazing. I tried to ""conversation"" translate a German movie that has some English-language moments. I tired to approx 5 mins. it picked up 2 sentences. another test was a sign in Spanish, it did translate it. that was cool."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a daily user of this app, and someone who relies on it to communicate, the latest update has made it extremely frustrating. The Tap to Translate feature used to be 1 tap, hence the name. Now it is abuut 5 taps and extremely cumbersome to use. Whoever made this terrible UX decision obviously has never used this feature themselves. Please fix it."

I enjoyed working on this app and it made my job so easy."

I'm not able to find it again on the app store. Previous review: Haven't used this app in a while and suddenly it displays a 'notification ad', first time I saw something like that. Also had 3 ads just when opening up the app. Uninstalled immidiately."

I have been using it for a year infact it is useful in translation. And i use it while reading newspaper to translate the some specific word but i am concerned about the thing that when i copy the word which starts from 'F' it doesn't take on the whole in copy , either it doesn't copy that word as a whole or it isn't able to recognise that word onthe translate screen. I hope soon you would rectify it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Translate does not come automatically when you copy the text even if tap to translate is open. You have to copy and tap again after this update. Floating appears always.it was not as it used to be. Before it only shown when the text is copied
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What was unique about this app is that the floating head would disappear after 3 seconds, and then which doesn't happen anymore. Also the (X) thing for removing the floating head also disappeared . The app used to be much more practical and easy. Now I can't use the app because it became similar to other translation apps. I hope you guys fix it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is really good but this app is not good for Marathi and Kannada languages as the translation does not convey the actual meaning behind the sentences and conveys a different meaning. This needs to be reviewed and experts/linguists in these two languages are to be engaged for a better experience. I hope you would do the needful.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Does not always give proper translation from English to Chinese and vice versa. Keeps reading Spanish/ Chineze as Thai for some unknown reason.... Does the same for Simplified Chinese and also English. Was this developed in Thailand? (Lol) Defaults to Thai almost everytime. Is a good app ;but needs to be more accurate in identifying languages.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best translator as per my experience. Before installing this application I used to have a lot of trouble in understanding bengali and I've used a number of translators but none could fulfill my expectations,also their translations weren't correct to the point, but this one is very efficient and handy. Google products are always one of the best."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy and efficient to use, although it does not have all languages, mostly the ones of African Culture. The app is very good though. Also, they should add voices to non-supported languages as it makes it easier to understand."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At a point I was having doubts within me if I was actually using the same translator as I did before the update. The former update was a billion times better than this one. I could copy a text and instantly a translated version will pop up on my screen. But now I cannot do that anymore and it was what made this app so great. Now I have to go find another app that can. So unfortunate
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Im giving it 2 stars only because I hate the new update where the translator icon stays floating on the screen at all times. I HATE stuff floating on my screen. Why can't the icon just pop up when you copy something like it used to. I do not like this change of the new update. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. In fact I may even see if other translators are reliable. That is how much I hate having something on my screen at all times!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some times it just hang up..most problem I get when, I use the Portuguese language ,it does not translate from English or vice a versa atall..it's really disturbing. In a middle of an meeting.its like this...I had download for offline use still the problem persistent. Can the developer look into this asap"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is horrible. If I'd known I'd have left my old installation how it was. The new update is more complicated to use, less accessible and just worse. It use to be easy to even draw the characters you wanted translated. That option isn't there anymore. So sad and disappointed"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok I guess, but most of the time when I try to translate persian, the wrong thing comes out. For example, in the English tab I typed in ""Oh no! I'm under a tack!"" (tack, not attack), but instead of translating it properly it said in persian, ""Oh no! I'm under surrender!"". It doesn't really translate sentences properly. Also When my aunt called my someone from America, she used google translate to talk, but it came out all gibberish. Please fix this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I'm abroad, the translator doesn't work on wifi. I've tried using the different phones same result (galaxy s21 ultra, Google pixel 6, galaxy s23 ultra.) This is very inconvenient since cellular data using always reliable in other countries and when I'm traveling is when I need the translator the most."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am unable to download offline language. Every time I try to download it shows error and keeps on moving as ""starting to download"" for hours. I have installed in internal storage, I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app but still there is same problem. This is so frustrating. There is no help or support for this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Once you get the hang of it this app is pretty good. It might be nice to be able to put downloaded language files on the device's removable micro SD card. And dark mode would help as well. But otherwise this app is really useful
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,New layout is worse than previous one. You need to use menu button to go to main app when you select a text and tap translate. I want to see all possible meanings of the text not just the first one. Please bring it back.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although I like this app and think it translates correctly most of the time, often it does not. For instance, a big faux pas when it comes to translation of English to Arabic. Don't want to get another translation app but may have no other choice."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Although the translation is not 100 percent accurate all the time (no translator app is), it's very easy to use in comparison to all the translator apps. I like the reverse translate features too. Highly recommend."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app, but like others, really want the option that used to be available for the icon to automatically reappear when copying to translate text. It will be 5* again, if this is fixed. Meanwhile, I will have to use other translation apps."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update I cannot import an image and highlight the text I wanna translate, anymore... despite all the permission And, pay attention, it memorizes all the words, phrases, etc, that your asked to translate...😱 Just scroll down and you'll find everything"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wish there was a sound button for the list of phrases marked as favorites. A quick access, without having to access each phrase to be able to listen to them. Excellent pronunciation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently my app has not been convenient, whenever i copy and past any words it shows wrong translation like "" word00% "" in both English and my native language. Pls fix the problem. I have been using the app for over 2 years."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new version does not convert to wide screen when you rotate your phone like it use to. I used that feature a lot. Especially during the pandemic so you are not too close.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is horrible. Google translate camera no longer useable,Google Lens can't detect the word you want,especially japan vertical word and you can't choose where you want to translate in the photo like it use to anymore. I use this app for communication but now it really diffcult to use this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would only record sound for 5-8 seconds and could not in fact detect a 2 language conversation. Would either choose English or nothing. Recording and translations were otherwise great. Will update review once I try other features. Sideloaded on an Amazon Fire Phone 64GB
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app but the tap to translate feature refuses to open up with with the primary language I have set.....and also opens with a random previous translation, extremely annoying, it should open with a fresh page in my primary language instead of me having to change and reset everytime I open it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is no longer user friendly. I can't see any translations instantly. I have to scroll to the bottom in order to read them and I can use the app without accessing the Internet. Even the typical text translate function doesn't work without being connected to the Internet. What happened?!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It was good as it was! The redesign is terrible: I can't find most of the buttons I need AND I've lost the full screen mode which means my dad has to find his glasses everytime I translate words I don't know in chinese. Bring it back!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Has worked perfectly for years. However recently it has changed as there is a floating icon now always on. I know I can turn that off but then it requires a 3 step process to open app and translate. However I preferred just copying a sentence from another app and the option to translate appears. How do I get this back ?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty useful still pain to use. I feel like if u could make floating icon where touching on u can translate stuff or when u copy some text there would be suggestion for translate like copy or paste , so it will be a lot easier and handy to use while reading books. 😅"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi, excellent & works offline, just download first the languages & most support voice playback offline & this did not change when online. One button copy the translated message to clipboard but the top main text message translated needs to be selected to copy it. Lacks simple telltale issues & text size adjustments & no color arrangements."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is too slow at listening and procesaing speech from TV. Chinese and Russian. Result - the app only translates half the sentence before cutting out, then starts translating the next sentence. I have a new model phone with a fast snapdragon processor."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having translated from two languages into English, it is alarmingly evident that a staggering 70% of the translations are inaccurate. This level of incompetence might be excusable for a fledgling app from an inexperienced developer. However, for a tech giant like Google, it is nothing short of unacceptable. The company's vast resources and experienced developers make this subpar performance even more puzzling. It's disheartening to see that even an established company like Google can fall so far"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think this might be the most amazing translator I've used. I work in a highly culturally diverse tourist destination and the offline translate feature is great because our service sucks here but the overall capabilities make this app worth gold. Hopefully they don't charge in the future because this helps our society communicate beyond language barriers! Here's to us humans! Thank you google!!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Tap-to-translate notification affects battery life being active in the notifications area. This feature previously can be rubbing in the background without showing in the notification bar. Please make it available to hide it again like the older versions.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Less functional, too big, swap easy option removed , and so on....why you destroyed something good??? Can I remove update and come back to previous version, please??? This app was my need. Now just annoyingly time consuming. Does not even remember silly 2 language you use the most. Drama."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I launch the app, I get a popup text stating that it pasted everything I had in my clipboard, but no text actually got pasted into the app, by the looks of it. I guess it's just Google being what they wanted not to be at some point in history"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to use it for more than 5 years since i left my home and lived in country that speaks totally different language. It is amazing literally and nothing else can discrape how google trasnlate saved me! In studying, communicating, travelling and more But right now.. At the moment it getting a bit annoying! It keeps closing and freezing.. 🙄Please fix ittt"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Impossible to handwrite anything but your native language because the app automatically enters/erases everything you've written in literally 1 second, assuming you're done writing. Imagine trying to write an unfamiliar Chinese or Japanese kanji lol. Impossible. It's mind boggling that there's no option to disable this ""feature"". 1 star until this is fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Enable dark mode. It's too bright. Also, editing a text before and during translating is very inconvenient and hard. You can only see one line of the whole text. Very annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New interface is very rdiculous. New interface creating a disturbance like where i have to click first, and where will be results shown. Due to this i forget sometimes what i have to translate. It doesn't deserve any stars. I feel like😵"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new UI looks nice but makes it so unusable for me with the gigantic font. Please give us option to change font size, it's very annoying when you want to read long paragraphs and you have to scroll just read the next sentence."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate always active. In my old smartphone the tap-to-translate is transiently appearing and can be closed. In the new version of android 10, the tap is always on my screen and I cannot close it unless I turn off the option of ""tap to translate "", any help?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate, always on screen. I want to return it as it was before. It only appears when I copy texts. Already sent feedback to you. Kindly fix this problem ASAP Its permanent presence on the screen causes inconvenience."

Google Translate Not soo show you the correct one""it's ok. I have a issue, Why I can't download Japanese language for ofline, I tried it hundred times to download, but I can't 😕."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,With the latest update I can no longer move the app to external storage. This means I'll have to remove it from my 3 year old phone as I do not have enough storage. On 25/2 Kirk Messer made the same comment but Google did not understand. It is simple; it used to be possible to move this app to external storage. This is now not possible. This means it takes up too much internal storage and I have had to remove it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After upgrade latest android the logic of using this app is stupid. Before it appears when copy text to enable traslarion if required. Instead taking smarter step forward, and let the app automatically do a two way massenger chat conversation transactions, it is annoying me all the time taking a part of the screen. So stupid."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If we are talking on WhatsApp So sometimes it stops working Sometimes it doesn't even translate please fix it Popup window Keep the voice translate option inside Sometimes talking on WhatsApp requires voice translation But this time the option does not return So we have to open the application and translate it back And there is an option in which a message can be sent immediately after translating. It takes a lot of time to copy and paste. thanku good bye.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good for us but some time it not response good bcoz when we want to use voice feature to translate our message it's very slow and also not perfect message delivered.in slow internet speed it's act to run the app but i think it's only run UI. It's too good but please more focus on UX.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The translation of the app is subpar, but while scanning the photo to translate it, the app hangs, and my mobile restarts after it automatically. Please resolve it. This is a very important app for translating languages. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. the tap to translate function is broken 2. The UI is not user friendly anymore. It used to be simpler, easier and faster to translate! We all were happy with the old UI and the function. Why did you guys change everything in it ......."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please, bring back the old version, this update made it useless. It was my favorite translation app. I have another problem, when I want to translate from a language to another, the translation doesn't appear, instead there's: ""can't translate, check your connection and try again"" 👎"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I looked it before. But now every time I open the app and use it, I get an advertisement with noisy music sometimes even twice. I got annoyed and uninstalled the app. I rather use translation available on the internet."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This used to be my go to translator. But this new dangling icon is for the birds. It is always in the way. It doesn't matter how small it will become. I really loved the copying something and immediately the translator would pop up. I find this new system of the floating icon unusable. I will be moving on to another translator. Because you have seriously lost me on this last upgrade. I hate it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app now ruined! This was a really useful app that in the recent ""update"" has been completely ruined! Yet another example of something that absolutely didn't need ""fixing"" but somehow somebody thought it was a good idea to mess about with it and remove simple things like history, definitions of different ways a word is used, links to alternative words.... Good job guys, now I'm looking at other apps which was completely unnecessary before. 😬🤯"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I would like to say thank you for your effort ( For creatimg and maintaining that app). Before updating my smartphone this app was working perfectly. Now why its not appering only when i copy a text. Now to see all the time on my screen really annoying and also I'm sure for most of the users too. I'm not juding you for this particuler issue. im giving you 5 stars and I believe soon you will solve this problem as always. :)
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the update, copy to translate function is not working on Facebook App. After copying the text, the translator bubble appears on the left corner (completely at the edge), and when i touch it, it disappears :((("
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Translation loading forever using WiFi and it will work using only data. Haven't tested on offline mode yet. Reinstallation doesn't solve the problem. And I find out Microsoft translation works like a charm.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the update is definitely bad, I love the old features where the tap icon will only pop up after copying text, its 100% usefull. but not anymore. many users are complaining abt ggl translate upd is sucks now. devs also removed the history panel in main page, which make it harder to use, example to see recent translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to work really well. Now any time I want to use the voice translation it doesnt work. I've tried uninstalling and updating the app and it still wont work. The old version worked great, but the new version is terrible"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The translations into Tagalog (Filipino) are so bad. Most of the time it comes out as random words. Requesting an edit it a waste of time as I would be requesting it for so many words/phases. The sentence formation is horrible as well. And some words it won't translate even though there are English equivalents. It would be a great thing if google hired a team of native speakers to teach the system how to translate. IN RESPONSE: There are so many inaccurite translations that I'd spend hours.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Translate app can work efficiently. Every time it shows me error message ""Can't translate. Check your connection and try again"" even mobile date is on condition. All internet connection related apps are apps runs successfully except Google translate app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Failed to translate. This app used to work pretty well, but lately it's been saying ""Failed to translate."" This has happened on Wi-Fi as well as with cell service; if there's a connection problem, I don't think it's on my end."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The UI from October 2021 version was the best for intense users. Also whenever you pull down for notification and tap on the banner you will instantly see the floating bubble again which is very useful for me and other intense users of the app but more intrusive for casual users. The UI needs to contain an option for intense users which would include the October 2021 version UI and then the current UI for casual users. Since android claims to be all about customisation.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Quite good, if you know how to translate things. Sadly instant translate does not work anymore, it just refuses to pull updates from the camera after the first frame. (issue persists throughout different OS flavours, other camera based apps work fine)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"That thing is so useful! U can download all the languages and translate online. This function is very helpful when I'm at school and have no Internet. But the offline mod is also much worse the online, because it doesn't have all translations. But it's cool anyway"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works well, I really don't like the new UI though, it's unintuitive, cumbersome, and expanded options are only available when the keyboard is minimised, which is really frustrating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very useful app! Glad that it finally has Turkmen language! Of course, it has some (machine) mistakes when you translate into Turkmen. I would like to inform you that I'm also English Turkmen translator, if I can help you with any further developments, I'm ready to help...."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new UI is wonderful! A very welcome improvement. But they totally broke tap to translate. The feature is dead unless your willing to waste screen real estate 100% of the time. Pop up when needed is gone now
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Works great and I translate to Taiwan and the phone says the sentence and then it is sent in a 3 or 4 switch tap to send to Thailand. It could have a more direct send toggle switch on it but I can work it to voice type in English and toggle and send it all the way to Thailand.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is really helpful, but lately it has become so difficult to use because I can translate only few times and then it stops and says ""Translate has stopped."" So, I have to close the app and reopen it. I have the latest version of it and I don't know what's wrong with it. Please let me know if there's a solution for this problem. Thank you!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This most recent update is very frustrating. The text box blocks the translated text that I am attempting to view. I click on 'done' and the whole translation seems to disappear. Deeply frustrating!!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sometimes this app doesn't translate all the sentences in a paragraph. It only translates the last sentence or first sentence of that paragraph. Due to this issue i cannot able to translate properly kindly fix this issue. If you improve the scanner option this app will be more helpful .
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Does it allow you the option to download languages for offline translation? Yes. Does it give an error that it won't translate the languages you already downloaded because you don't have an internet connection. Yes. Used their biggest competitor's app because it actually does allow offline translation. Edit: your suggestions didn't work. I didn't need to go this lengths with Microsoft Translator.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not good for translating documents or longer pieces of text. Totally inaccurate. However it's one of the best translators still, and works well for short pieces of text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm growing sick and tired of this app. It's not pronouncing words of other languages correctly. I've been trying to use it in unison with my Spanish class, but then my Spanish teacher says I've been pronouncing the words all wrong.

I don't even update this app after that last request, so how? But Am I seeing it wrong now? Or am I dreaming at that time? And I thought in the latest update I don't have to back to the front page if I want to translate alot of image. It will still stay in the same folder. I don't hv to go back and forward just to read multiple screens shoots. SO WHY?????????"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use this app all the time. We have a highly skilled handyman, but his primary language is Spanish. He and I communicate through Google translate. Also, many of the students I teach speak two languages and their parents fill out forms in their non-English native language. Again, thanks to Google translate, I'm able to read what the parents have written about their students and I can be a more effective teacher."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the recent update its cause users become harder to use it and the apps looks so stupid now. Previously will used camera scan and it read and traslate so well. But after the recent updates, the camera scan translate weird and not as previous version. Please change back to previous version.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You guys have taken an app that was working perfectly, totally fit for purpose, and had great functionality.... And utterly destroyed all of this and made it basically utterly useless with this most recent ""Update"" you have implemented.

You have destroyed everything that was that good and useful about this app 😠."

I'll scrutinize this app, to verify if that disappearing is caused by put the cell phone in earplain mode, after downloaded such package to use as so. But I'm suspicious that it can be or a bug or some intrusion on my phone that deserves a repot to google for warn me. Otherwise, I love this app with the feature of hold an offline one"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app. But there is no option to physically write anything anymore? The camera doesn't always perfectly pick up every stroke of a character in characters that do not use letters and writing it into the app was always so useful...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favorite app. My husband speaks his native tonal language, My only language is English and I am trying my best to learn his language, he speaks English also. When I learned what this app was capable of, we were both ecstatic!!! I have been searching for many years for the African YORUBA language. And it was under my nose all along,with the accent symbols, and it is free. I would have happily paid many times over for this app. We are world travelers and this app has made us smile"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use the app to save time and to do it more accurately, actually it's so inaccurate in my language it is translated literally, the English phrases and idioms are translated literally and inaccurately, impossible to have accurate translation without detailed check of the text. I made a screenshot of the scanned English text and I am very sorry that I can't upload it here and show you how it is the text scanned and showing words that don't even exist in English language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The lastest updated version is not worth to get even a single star. Lots of bugs. Worst interface. Less user friendly.. I've totally stopped using it .. creates lots of troubles. Requesting to get back the old version asap.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not as good as sticking a Babel Fish into your ear, but better than pointing and shouting repeatedly in your native language in a vain attempt to be understood. The camera translation thingy is fun too...often useful and sometimes hilarious."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate only works now in floating mode. It requires extra steps now and half the time, it still doesn't work.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New version is a usability disaster. Downloaded languages don't stay downloaded. History is not working right. So much wasted space. It's much slower. Another Google app gone to the dogs.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If the selection of ""Translate"" button from the pop up menu doesn't do any actual translation, then what's the point of having it in the first place?? Whenever I select a word to translate, the app just shows the same word as the other selected language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was good and convenient, now it's super annoying. At first automatically it detect the languages and do the translation. The floating icon appears automatically when the text copied. Now total stupidity. Is there a option to give stars in minus ? Even the one star is not worthy"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update google translate is a real hassle to use. I understand wanting to be ""modern"" but taking something that isn't broken and trying to spice it up took away a lot of the great functionality this app used to be. Please go back to the previous version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google Translate app is the best translation app I have ever used and it is so user friendly. Now I can talk and write in any language. This app helps me reach out to more of a fan base with my music. Now I can communicate with people and there is no language barriers. I have been meeting mor music fans from all over the world. Which has been a great learning experience for me. Thanks Google Translate.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was good app but after the newest update the camera function is horrible. Taking pictures is so hard because the pictures are blurry! However when I open my camera it looks fine, so its just this app that makes the photos blurry and then the translation can't be read properly. Please fix it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is wonderful until the last UI change. Its a nightmare! Okay, I understand you guys want a major UI change. But don't cut features! The Fullscreen feature. Do you know how useful it is? DO YOU KNOW! Plz give us a legacy mode PLEASE!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good and useful app. But I give 4 stars because the camera thing (the one which you take photos of the text and it gets translated) is not very reliable and accurate. Its translated text changes every now and then apart from this, 5/5"

The rest of the app is great. I belong to a chat group and game that is multinational and I need to translate a lot. Google Translate is very easy to use in that respect. I just need the chatroom to work.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant app but very poor recent update. Feedback submitted twice but no change. A pity it got broken when it didn't need fixing. Now lost functionality and made switching between languages difficult, so text gets lost and has to be retyped. Poor dev team"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It has developed a habit of crashing (silently - no ""app has stopped"" popup) on loading an image for translation. At least this saves me from seeing the appalling new design of the UI. Please roll back. (Update: reported as advised)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Works great. Still not 100% accurate but it gets me through. I especially like the translating from the camera feature as it pretty much lets you read signs from the street provided the conditions are good.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Needs an interface refresh and could use some of Android's modern functionality to avoid ""reinvention of the wheel"", such as usage of Android 11's bubble functionality rather than drawth over other apps for its functionality that is called ""Tap to Translate"", and usage of the default camera application when a photograph needs to be taken and translated afterward rather than instant translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's wrong with the Tap to Translate button appearing only after I copy text, instead of it annoyingly hanging on my screen, crashing all the time, as it does after the update? How is that an improvement?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Japanese translation is very poor, it reads out the text in Chinese?! After taking a picture and then selecting kanji compositions without hiragana, it reads them out in Chinese not in Japanese. If you include hiragana it mostly works fine. Disappointing as at most places there will be no hiragana."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new translate is awful. I do not know why the bar was moved from the bottom to the top on translated web pages. It gets right in the way of where we most scroll and tap on webpages. Before at the bottom it was out of the way.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your response is not useful. One link to instructions on how it used to work. The other link does not work. You can visit their forum comments on this issue which basically is suck it up. So Google stop using the term ""tap to translate"" - you don't offer that feature in any useful form. It's just a translation app now. Android 10 has ruined this app. There really is no useful tap to translate function now. It won't work in chat apps. Remove reference to this feature and I'll adjust rating."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is decent but it never inputs the correct words I'm speaking..then again it also occurs with my Google assistant or sprach to text as well so it may not be the apps entire fault. I'm using a Google pixel 3xl and this issue has been occuring since I bought the phone brand new.

Looking forward for a better improvement... Thank you 😊"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app works fine for me. I mostly translate Xhosa and Zulu to English or vice versa. It translate faster even before I finish typing, gives suggestion and uses less data. I also use it to copy and paste an online articles - No need to type just copy, paste and share."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How to ruin an app... Copy to translate was the most useful feature of this app, and it is gone. Offline translation has never worked, and isnotfixed either. I am de-installing and will look for an alternative that makes my transation easier."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One problem after the lastest update. Tap to translate now shows an icon and notification in the status bar and notification panel that can't be removed without turning off tap to translate. After Google fixes this, 5 star app for sure. Best language translator available."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty much useless. The language I need (Lao) is not available offline, I can't use the camera to translate Lao signs to English, and its suggestions of alternative translations are all in Lao script with no romanised help. Sure, the Lao alphabet gives the correct intonation so I'd better get learning it to use this app, right? Easier said than done in a short time. I may as well use the web browser translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new update is not good. With the old one I would just copy a text message and translate would automatically detect the language and do the translation but with this one its not even detecting the language. I have to keep manually changing it
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why do you remove the old scan feature from the camera? The new camera scan is even WORSE than the old one. To translate Japanese, the camera used to allow me to translate from RIGHT to LEFT but now it only translate from LEFT TO RIGHT which is a completely wrong way to read japanese comics."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate the new interface. Hiding buttons that used to be on screen until you make extra button presses. Used to be compact but now you have to scroll around, more work to access translations."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was having trying trouble with the conversation part of the app not working at all. After emailing support I had an answer and a fix within 24 hours. Google Translate does help me a lot with people I work with and friends.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for destroying tap to translate feature! Instead of showing this annoying ""permanent"" icon or notification for tap to translate, perviously it was more fine that when tap to translate feature is on and user copies text, the icon appears momentarily."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good for translation but, the new tap to translate feature is very bad.in previous update it works very good and simply.the floting botton automatically appears when coping any word..but the latest update remove that feature.and sometime the floting botton disappear permanently and sometime it floats permanently. We want the previous update back.Give back that feature."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great when it works. The ability to scan is cool, but needs to be less impacted by phone movement. The speak/translate function seems okay when it understands the speaker."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I don't like that now with Android 10 it's either bubble always there on the screen or not. I liked that it would automatically appear when I copied a text and then automatically disappear after used. Not liking the new setup at all
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using this to actually learn Korean!! On other learning apps they restrict what you learn because i was trying to learn how to say ""I love BTS!!"" but nothing!!

I absolutely love this app. But the 1 you could fix is the pic translate', idk but it translates sloppy"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The conversation feature with voice instant translation is extremely useful. However it need internet to use it. Is there anyway we can use voice translation off-line as we don't always have internet while travelling
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why always change the setting. Last time right and left button can set different languages so is easy to translate but bow cannot. Last time i can easil3translate either chinese to english or either way but now cannot. Don't simply change the setting after update. The apps should be more user friendly not other wise
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The voice recognition is very poor. If i speak stimulated it catches immolate,envisions catches pigeons,and in hindi, i speak विशद, it catches निषद and i tried lot of time to say the same word and wasted my lots of time on a single word. And some time this forced me to use manual dictionary. If i have to use manual dictionary, then why we built this kind of technology. So if it is possible to correct the issue, then make it sure as soon as possible."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Like the others have said as of a few days ago now I have to go through a three steps to translate something when I used to just highlight copy it would go straight to the translator app I would read it tap new Translate copy and then turn around and paste and send it back to my wife it doesn't work that way anymore I have to copy and paste four times in order to do a translate opening close my messenger window and do to your Translate window go back to the way it was the way it is now it sucks

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New version (Jan 2022) is horrible. Clunky. Extra taps needed to get from Point A to Point B. The hover feature doesn't work as it did before. Not good at all. I'm trying to find an alternative now.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good translation app, but for sone reason in the camera function the bottom bar with scan and import function always disappears. The only way to get it back is to uninstall/reinstall the app."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,New update has improved alot than the previous one and in history section there has been added dates as on which date we did that translated word. I would further like to give suggestion that there could be game in app for the words we have translated until now( from history ). It helps to see does after some days do we still remember that word's meaning or not.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is good and all but u can't translate languages like Hindi, Chinese, korean, Thai and more by using the pictures. But apart from it, its a nice app for translating when u dont have net."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would enjoy the app better if it would translate it from computer speak but it translates enough that you know what's going on it works really well if you are looking for something just from one language to the next but if you're trying to figure out the phone speak and you won't be able to do it but if you're just trying to translate what one person says to another it works really great
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Google Translate. It's been a very useful companion to me for many years now.l especially like it when l can directly copy a vocab or text to the App and immediately get the translation.lt makes reading a variety of texts without worrying about the number of unfamiliar or forgotten words.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why mess with something that was perfect already? Google Lens... sucks!!!! I can't scan or choose the text I want to translate. It picks EVERYTHING up and I spend more time deleting out unwanted text to get to the text I want translated. Go back to the GT before the new Septemeber 28th update. God, I hate GT now. My job depends on GT and now I can't use it. Fire the moron who thought this one up!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's eh it's not that great I mean it is kind of like a mobile version of Google translate and it has more features than the online one but a problem is that it's hard to translate pictures and if it does translate it usually translates incorrectly on pictures soo it's only really good for text translation and not pictures but you might as well use the online me one at this point

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since an update in late 2019, voice translate always stops listening a few words short. This is extremely frustrating, especially for people who usually use voice translate like me. Renders the app virtually useless."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the WORST App EVER. I uploaded and downloaded it several times to see if it will match the first original but it failed my test woefully. Why can't you leave both the new one and old one so that we make a choice? We are ready to PAY for the old one 🙂
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app but why did you change it? The new format that takes up the whole screen is annoying. Would like at least the option to have it split like before where I could see the translation as I type.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap to translate no longer works even when utilizing the floating icon. It requires you to tap the floating icon then paste the text before it translates. Before it used to be an automatic translation of the text you copied just by tapping the icon.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the previous design / UI was better and much easier to use. The current UI now uses too many click and it can get too annoying at times. Whoever thought of this design just made the app inconvenient and not user friendly
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It have helped me a lot of times, but English It's the most universal language over the world now days , helps people to communicate even through if they are from different cultures an different places of the world, would be really good if you guys let the English language data to be downloaded at the phones to be used offline cause the most common thing that happens at the airports or foreign places of the world It's that you don't already have a internet plan and you need to get communicated"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Writing are is very little. Also animation is not needed and unuseful. I don't want that when I click the textbox it starts being little. This is not a good idea for user friendly development. If Microsoft designs this app it would not be like that
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have used Google translate for about 10 years, and mostly without issue. However, given that Google translate is over ten years old AND supports a number of somewhat obscure languages (Aymara?; Mizo?; Tatar?), it is unacceptable that it does not support Cantonese. Yes, it offers traditional Chinese. But Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese are two different languages. Why no response, Google?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It didn't translate that good from English to मराठी and vice versa. This can cause misguidance to the people who aren't that aware of both the languages. But still its good to an extent. And with some advancements can turn great.👍
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After a recent update, the app now has a little button that appears over everything like Facebook does. However, I can't swipe it away, just moves it across my screen. There is instructions to make it disappear in the settings but you have to go back in and change it everytime you want to use it or get rid of this eyesore. This worked fine in the background before, why change it to something like a child that demands your attention? This annoying little button shows up in screenshots too!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is goos overall, some words are missing but thata ok. My biggest problem is that once in a while it crashes and doesnt open. I have a OnePlus 6, every other app works perfectly, but google translste has to die once in a while."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was the best translating app before, now they changed the UI and now its bulky and horrible. I cant easily switch the languages im typing. I have to hit the back button. Worst design flaw of all time honestly. Ill look for a different app if there is one"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new update is very disappointing..the floating icon is not at all functional, it pops up and disappears without any reason. Earlier it used to stay.And coming to translation ,Many major languages like Spanish and Chinese are not properly translated into English with word to word meaning...whats the use of the translator then????"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I try to use camera or import pictures the app become automatically shut down.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its just not a good listener...sometimes it fixes my verbal errors and other times it creates words based on verbal errors i didn't make. Ive said the same phrases many times and often have had different results an the same phrase.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,you guys have got a very serious problem with one of your created translator that will haunt my phone until the day you fix it or when my phone shuts down. I cannot get rid of it and everytime i go to another page it translates it to another language when I dont want it but it to but it does it anyway. If you can fix this problem then that will be the greatest improvement you will ever make with one of your translators.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Oh my gosh, the new UI (user interface) of google tranlate is horrible. Why did they change the good old UI? The worse is there isn't a button to return to the old design if you want. The new UI is available for Android 11, last update for google translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this app, but after last update it force to use it with account(for translation by cam). It's big privacy issue for me. I can't even find account setting where to forbid to save translation results, usage of my translation data by google is also unknown. I recommend to uninstal app and use web browser instead."

Have checked all permissions are on, clear cache, cleared data, reinstalled the app and still having the issue. No forums online have any answers. A real shame...my partners android version 8.1 is ok but my android version 9 will not work. Response unhelpful...works fine on my other phone with exactly the same settings and wifi"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was such a handy, quick, useful and easy to navigate app, now after upgrade I can neither makr a head nor tail of it, absolutely useless. Better uninstall now, looking for some alternative translator. Thanks for making it from best to worst."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Asks me to backup every single time I use. Annoying. Also cannot translate individual kanji because everything is automatically translated in camera translate feature now and has made studying individual kanji much harder. Please revert to scan then highlight to translate a portion feature.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For most European languages the app is reasonably accurate, but Saudi, Emitrati, Qatari, Thai and Japanese friends that are truly bi or multi lingual, say it is good at single words but appaling with two or more. It becomes a grammatical farce and complete nonsense."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish I'd rated this 0 stars if it was an option. My first bad review. Ever since the last update this app became scrap,no copy and paste option.NOTHING important the update has brought.Nothing. I'm trapped in conversations where I can't copy and translate things. Feels frustrating..TBH."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is super App, big up. I managed to translate the settings of my car radio from Japannese to English through camera and it works very well and managed to solve the problem.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It would be great if the app automatically recognized that a language other than my native language was being sent and offered to translate, rather than having to copy and paste to receive and send. If this were possible it would be worth a 4 as it is I would give a 3star. Phillip"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This latest update is horrible doesnt automatically switch languages like before. Have to click and switch and all this extra. Please bring back the old version. This is very hard to have a comversation and have to always switch langeages copy and paste and switch switch switch
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why dose the App suddenly doesn't find any offline files anymore and also does not offer any for download?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"offline voice translation NOT working. The most important time to have voice translation available is usually in remote or rural areas with no internet connection and the locals only speak their local language. Therefore, I am disappointed with this app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst app ever. The offline mode is so useless that most of the time it doesn't display the translation or it shows wrong translation. Don't use it for home works cause you have to correct the wrong translations. 0☆
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app it's a little off at time different dialects it'd be better if they had more dialects in it and more of a younger slang I guess I'm not really sure how to put that but it's a little off most the time it's right sometimes it's not some of the words are different different dialect good app though
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a complete way to get satisfied by the correct statement in your language with the help of translation....this app still contains some big errors in statement formations though. Overall the performance is perfect.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Translate is pretty good, especially when tied in to Lens visual searches. Very useful overall. It's losing two stars today because animal names are extremely broken in Luganda, especially cats. I've reported it countless times but nothing changes."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this mobile application for three years. It has given excellent experience in everything for instance catch my voice,fast speed translation which I write, and I speak after on Mike.It also helps people for learn synonyms of any word.We can use this app for translate over 100 languages.Therefore it is the best language translation application for mobile according to me."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Realized that the latest version for the Tap to Translate button does not disappear from the screen after translation. Prefers it to disappear from the screen like the last version rather than be on the screen all the time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really would like to have a dark mode, my eyes get tired when I'm trying to use the app in dark rooms and during the night. The contrast of this app from the other apps with dark mode is colossal."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was great before this update. Now it's total trash. It doesn't allow you to switch between languages easily. It requires much more input for the same result. What a bad bad bad update.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New interface looks terrible. Please make a setting to go back to the old one. Edit: if you care for users' experience leave the option to switch to the old interface design.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Thanks for reply. I just want to allow 'Scan' and 'import' option for offline mode. Only by camera lens works offline. I have to close app and reopen the app for next 'import' doc. It doesn't work with back key.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,helpful for novices in foreign countries where there is strong need of an app to help you out. I would recommend that it should work offline also because that would be like hitting the bulls eye and also take the app to new heights as well. heartfelt thanks.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Indispensable tool! Google Translate's accuracy and wide language support make communication across borders a breeze. Whether for travel or learning a new language, it's my trusted companion. A language barrier? Not anymore!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Worst ! Translate app that I have ever met in the way of my life , useless always showing incorrect translations when translate from Hindi to english , Please improve the Hindi Vocabulary of this app , 2 stars because other features are very good it has voice , camera , conversation and even handwriting translate"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part, the app works fine. But lately when using the speaking function, it often times leaves out the last word so I have to type it. Also curious why it doesn't start each new message with a capitol letter...trivial but still basic."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Translate has still not improved over the years. Things like adding multiple translations is gone. Flipping between languages doesn't work. I expect Google to have incremental improvements but I think they over think it and make it worse.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am rating this 3 stars because when I used this app in my previous phone, Korean speech output was available offline. But now it says that no speech output is available for Korean offline. Please fix this problem as soon as possible as it is becoming an obstacle in my progress of learning Korean."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I read a foreign language I choose a word to translate with the app but it just repeats the word, no translation. When I copy the word to Google translate, the web page, it translates very well. Why I can't translate directly by the app?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The old version is better than new version. The old version was easy to use but new version is typical to use like 1) Difficult to find word from history. 2) Not able to read meaning of word while typing. 3) Some time its text reader not works. Etc.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only reason why I commented is to suggest a night theme for this app. As a half-time writer whom is continuously learning english, I used this app quite frequently in my daily basis, even at night. So my eyes hurt a lot when using this app at night, so please add this theme. Also, I love how you can download the language so you can use it even while offline. Amazing app, overall."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very thankful for this app. suggestions: 1. Doesn't work on PDFs or Word documents in which I couldn't copy 2. Needs better ability to read various food menus, directional images, instructions for things. These are likely most critical uses of this app (especially oversees)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It does it's job, if you are willing to watch advertisement at EVERY opening. If you open your phone while the app was last open, an ad comes. I got my phone screaming at an Italian reataurant because of it. Instant uninstall."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was an excellent app. The new update removed the auto pop up when a word is copied from a text. Now I need to keep the pop up on screen all the time, which I don't. This app completely useless for me now. I hope they will fix it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is awesome but there's a slight hiccup. It won't translate spoken languages perfectly, it does translate to some extent but if you're talking to lets say an Arab who speaks levantine dialect this app will create a little confusion when translating the messages. Overall the app is highly recommended."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It doesn't even know how to translate English. It gives back the same word with some correction that doesn't make any sense. The Italian translation is ridiculous. The off line option is cool if it would have translated properly.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Updated Feb 2021 - Willie Hauff said it right, Tap to Translate has been made much inferior to what it was. Using other translation service until it is changed. Still a great at its roots translation program, but TaptoTranslate made it exemplary. I hope they go back to what worked."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really utilize this app because I have a daughter-in-law who I need help to be fluent in Spanish and know wendy she saying. This app does that and in any language you need. Great app to have for communication in any language! I use it when I drive Uber/Lyft because I meet many people from other countries in Chicago.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used this app since five to six months it's prove so helpful. However when I downloaded it in another phone right know its camera is not functional. It seems too problematic. So, I request to the google translator team try to resolve the camera issue as soon as possible. Kind Regards."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I will rate 5 stars but i am rating it on 4 due to only one reason. It is very good application for every aspect but there is lack of only one language which is very important for those who want to speak. This application lack ""Balochi"", this is the third largest language by population of PAKISTAN. I hope google team shall add this language in this application to make it more efficient. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Previous version that allowed many options of translation was easier to use and easier to swap languages back and forth. It's too spread and despite the design it isn't practical to use.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the first time since I bought my first smartphone, I am deeply impressed. 1) makes mincemeat of a major obstacle in my professional life; 2) is incredibly easy to figure out and use, for both sides of every language divide in my life (mostly non-English Spanish and Gujarati), & for every tech comfort zone; 3) is handy/fun to have in my personal life; 4) has Google standing behind it & should, in theory, not disrupt other vital/day-to-day operations on my android with bugs. Highly recommend."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's pretty decent but it has too many glitches. It doesn't always translate accurately and sometimes when your recording your voice it doesn't record the full sentence.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Text is too large to read long paragraphs without lots of scrolling. Also the ability to select and copy pronunciations was removed. Typical Google. Take something just great and turn it into garbage.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I used it when I was reading a book with Italian phrases and it worked well! However I uninstalled it now and will reinstall because offline translation suddenly stopped working. I need it now for a book with Spanish phrases.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I rate 3S for this. I used this app quite a long time but the updates making it degrade. Anyways I know that its hard to translate language, I admit it but sometimes the translations are a bit off. And most importantly can you get the offline latin back? I ised to download the offline latin back then but when I changed phones and updated the app the offline latin was gine. Please give it back🥺🥺"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am giving 2 stars only because for some reason this app has made me download Spanish offline twice and wasted my data. It continues to not allow me to translate Spanish while offline. It never ""failed"" to download, the app claimed download was successful both times. I have downloaded German offline and it lets me translate offline however not Spanish. Very annoyed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really easy to use. Simple toggle between languages allows you to easily reply and translate at touch of the screen. Great and easy tool to get you through a conversation or directions in another country.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the older version better, it is easy to use. It allows to switch languages easily. This is a downgrade to be honest. The tap to translate isn't easy anymore."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,the app has gotten so much better. The translation used to be gibberish because the app wasn't able to translate the sentence structure into another language. there's still some inconsistencies but great app overall

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good and useful app. But I give 4 stars because the camera thing (the one which you take photos of the text and it gets translated) is not very reliable and accurate. Its translated text changes every now and then apart from this, 5/5"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Previous versions would automatically display a full-screen text translation when the phone was turned horizontal. This is a very useful feature so I side-loaded apk of older version and disabled auto-update.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Downloaded for Ukrainian ok if you can read Cyrillic as it doesn't save expressions in Latin based format it gives you latin based letters then saves in Cyrillic so you learn very little inc in pronouncing words. Camera well doesn't work but thats usual with most apps. App is basic but better than nothing
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Getting better I think but just why did you change the way tap to translate works? I don't want a floating icon around my phone wasting my battery and getting on my way. Before, I would just copy a sentence and then an icon would appear, bring that back please! Edit: why is there no transcribe for Japanese? It's a well known language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Thanks for this app, I am using a lot! One suggestion: it would be great to know the gender of the translated nouns!! For example if I want to know the Hindi for ""flower"" it will show ""फूल""... but nowhere is mentioned masculine or feminine! Also, sometimes when I copy paste a long sentence the translation doesn't come. I need to type by hand!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why the tap translate icon displayed all the time? If I turn on always displayed on the side. Why not just that time when I copy some text? UPDATE: Long time ago when I copied something the tap option showed up automatically. And after 5sec when I didn't use it just disappeared. Why we don't have some similar option anymore?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Microsoft translate is way better. This app is janky at best. Can't pick up clearly sound words or from tv on full volume. Even when it does work it works like 1 out of 50 times and the buttons record randomly without pressing them. Really bad.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the new update tha app looks awful, it's harder to work with and it's basically useless and no one likes it. I've used Google translate for years and now I am so disappointed that I probably won't use it until you bring the older design or at least do something to repair that big mistake your team made here!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mostly this app doesen't let me translate it does work some times yes it does,but after all it mostly doesen't let me translate,for example:i turned it into english to chinese but when i scanned it to english text it mostly does not work instead it said no englis text found!!!plus mistakes like this it had chinese to english but it had the chinese text on my paper become spams like jut now it litteraly had chinese text into cab!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please fix this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new update is very bad ... i don't want to see the tap all the time ... only when i copy something the tap show is better that way .... at least give me the option to choose how the tap work ..... please fix it like it was before 😭😭😭
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is less intuitive to use, and it looks like it was designed to appeal to an elderly person with poor eyesight, text is now so big I have to scroll to do anything. Please revert changes back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm upset that the tap to translate feature is unavailable because my phone says that the permission has been denied because this feature will slow down my phone. Can anyone please help me. This feature used to work on my phone, but not anymore. I'm confused."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The former interface was better when it was showing over other apps, and you can easily use it and navigate through your phone ... Unlike now you have to open the app to translate which is kinda hectic to do .... Copy and paste almost everyone 😏"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update Sucks! I HATE IT! Why is everything all super sized big, im not that blind lol. The old app layout was much better and easier to translate. If i translate a paragraph i have to scroll down forever because the text is so BIG! The old design layout was much better and easier to use. You just made my life 10× harder, I use this app everyday to talk to someone. PLEASE ADD a feature to switch to the old layout!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I opened the app and it just pissed me off! I travelled to Ecuador where I have to use the translator all the time'cause people here speak Spanish and I don't. I had to type all I WANTED TO ASK, 'CAUSE IT DIDN'T READ THE VOICE AND JUST KEEP SEARCHING and searching and someone just says sorry man and left 'cause it takes a long freaking time head's down typing and stuff.Bring back the previous version please , I don't like it anymore,IT'S A FAIL. Google translate is not of use for me anymore."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best translater App ever O some guys Complaining the offline mode doesn't work it does but its little tricky once you opened the App from main screen when you see the language icon in which you want to translate click on it once you get in there's a download icon beside the preferred languages right side click on it download it from there 😉
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New upgrade ruined the app's simple usability it had before. It is less functional, I liked that i could easily see my previous translations, this new look is useless and annoying. Rather than skin upgrades, way better would be to work on translating precision."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was an wonderful tool till the last update, now you must enable the most unusefull tool that I have disable from long long time Google LLC(the search bar) who get a lot of trash and space and make slow your phone, and in some phones you can't disable, this app can totally remove. Please roleback the old version and take off connection with the search bar"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Pop up window translation is so short and the space of translated words or text is so small and too narrow. The space between translated text and translated spelling is too close and so confusing. I think it's better not to put translated spelling in pop up window translation. It's very difficult to read when I try to translate sentences or paragraphs...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After i had updated my device to Android 10, the floating icon doesn't show up after copying a text, I have to go to the app to translate it. It was such a convenient option to have but now it's gone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's not working properly at all. When I aim on a text it's not translating to the second language I selected. It just show one or two letters in second language. I am really disappointed about this app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was okay at first, but the new upgrade is annoying. Translating with camera now connects to google lens, and the translation is so much worse. Please revert to the old version, cause the translation was much more accurate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not able to translate from Tibetan to English. Also there is some lag in translation. Some words in Spanish or other languages are mistranslated at first, then after moving the phone camera a little bit, the actual translation comes up on screen. Please look into this matter."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I liked it better when it could be installed in card memory rather than in phone memory. Phone memory is precious, and eventually apps in it need to be deleted. I have a culling list! How confident are you that you are not high on that list?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somehow the app got WORSE at recognising Japanese? The picture feature used to highlight every character just fine, but now it won't recognise the big majority of the Japanese Im trying to translate. Please fix this. I have tried the solutions the developer gave me and neither worked."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm almost satisfied with this app.. but i have a suggestion thats is before if I copy a word or sentence the translation will open automatically but now i need to go to the app and i need to Change setting to tap to open translation ... that makes a bit difficult can you fix please.. thank you.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lovely app.... learn any language, translaye any language, speak any language... I mean literally, we're getting almost everything which basically an impatient guy needed for exonerating it's perfect version by getting a marvellous guide with perfect blend of google inc. for getting a way to begin with any language you love. This is crazy and after all this you all gotta know what kind of suggestion will gonna come from my side for this app....♥️♥️♥️. Guys, you're getting deity in form of app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing how developers take a perfectly fine app and in one fell swoop make it into a piece of junk, not user friendly and so time consuming to use. Read the other complaints about this version then restore the previous one."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why would you put effort into making it terrible to use? Translation bubble used to pop up and disappear automatically. Now everything is manual using a persistent notification and after every translation, you have to get rid of the bubble manually. No human tested this."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and helps a lot. But since recently, offline languages that are already downloaded cannot be installed. It just shows ""Installing..."" and that never stops."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Update: the new version works again. Hence 5 stars. It workes perfectly until recently it can't play voice in any languages except English... I tried to reinstall the app and restarted the phone and the same problem occurs.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"when i download this app. my phone suddenly pop out ads,i mean a lot of ads! i was not comfortable and felt weird. so i uninstall a lot of apps and it still same! so i try to uninstall this app and guess what? the ads disappeared!! omg and the ads was a video adds such as game adds. tf!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I find it inappropriate that we're forced to use the built-in horrible-quality voice typing feature when using our phone's voice typing ability provides far better results. Please! Take that restriction off!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It used to be risky using translate while learning new languages but it's really helped me with vocab recently. The biggest downside to translate right now is the lack of Arabic dialects, I have to go to wiki or my friends in order to learn regionally common words that aren't in MSA."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It says that it can translate 59 languages offline, which is not the case. You can download the language packs but without internet connection it refuses to do voice to voice translation. Offline mode only works for picture to text recognition."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not sure what happened, but since update at the end of June, Google Translate app is no longer readable. I only see grey colour boxes and also at times, it says not Cannot Translate,please check your connection? I am using Bing now."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This App was very good previously. Although the UI has changes drastically and more suitable for use, the key feature lf the app that is automatic detection on language using camera isn't supported after the new update which is very disappointing after using it for countless times. Basically the app has outrun uts usage in my day to day use. I wish the company had a long lasting customer satisfaction view for there users, rather than making money only."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be a great translation app .. bu after the latest updates it's became one of the worst apps .. The voice recording is so bad responding .. the history can't be easily managed as it used to be .. the appearance of translation page so ugly .. We hope to get something like what used to be before .. Tq
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why leave the bubble permanently on the screen? People are not constantly translating. The app worked well as it was. Why change a good formula? It's just idiotic. Update: Now the floating icon does not appear when I copy text. What is this? The formula worked before. Why change it?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is crashing a lot recently and I'm unable to translate words offline. Even though i have downloaded languages for offline use but to know good. Can't update the languages properly with out reopening the app because it crashes while downloading them too.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update is terrible! I've used this everyday for years with no issues. Now it's non intuitive, confusing and takes way to many taps to do a translation from other app!? Do us a favor and switch it back 🙏🙏🙏"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not exactly the app but I don't know where else to ask about this; what happened to popup original text in mobile browser google translate? I use google translate in mobile browser to read chinese novels, but every so often there is an incorrectly/incompletely translated paragraphs. Used to be able to click that area and it would display the original text, but now it wouldn't work and I would have to open the original webpage in a new tab and then scroll down till I find the paragraph."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"At the top of the app, can the ""<-->"" button's functionality be changed to ""Reverse Translate"" (similar to the web version), instead of currently whereby only the selected languages are swapped? For the purposes of UX standardisation that is."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't use camera translate Want to try translate something I can't write down on the normal translate app, remember that there's a camera feature, try to use it and it gets stuck on the 'new camera translation' and nothing else, try pressing camera again, still no camera or scan, force quit, still nothing, clear cache, reinstalling, wiping data, nothing in the end. Translate has been reliable in the past, so please fix the damn camera so I dont stare at promised new features that dont work"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi I don't recommend download it because before was just ok but now the translator can't give to put long text.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I write this review after several years of using. In general app works well and is useful enough, but I have a big problem with speech output in Hebrew. For whatever reason Google refuses to provide it. After all this time I seriously doubt it's a technical problem, in my opinion it's a political one. I could be wrong, but it definitely looks like there's no other explanations, at least Google doesn't provide one."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, tap to translate become unusable. Usually i can just copy text and the floating icon will shown after that but right now nothing happen.. also with this version i can't see the past search either. Love the last version better."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Translation is very typical . Also awkward at times. Many a times it just writes the word i write in the other languages which I want the translation in. Google needs to improve it highly. Found it useful very less. Also phrases and other linguistic things should be added.

But now this app didn't show anything .. when we used to distract on something there is a chance for again to cut the bill for the same customer!...So these should be fixed on the time.."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Japanese needs more above Improvement. Please make Japanese Language more accurate. Wrong translation leads to huge misunderstanding. But the camera is great, the offline translation is good, and the handwriting is not accurate as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally, your app would ONLY pop up the bubble when you copied something, which would disappear in 2 seconds if unused. THAT IS THE BEHAVIOR I WANT!! Some update last year killed that, and now the bubble stays up 24\7. I DON'T WANT TO DISMISS IT EVERY TIME I WANT TO TRANSLATE ONE SINGLE WORD OR SENTENCE!! Some of us are DISABLED and want TO MINIMIZE actions, damn it!! ♿⚕️⚠️"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Works for a fews day then it crashes to the point on no return. This means it will not receive any words even if you close the app. A temporary fix to this is to uninstall then reinstall. But why reinstall when you can find another app
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Under Android 10 the persistent tap to translate floating icon is annoying. Prior to Android 10 it worked flawlessly. It would only appear after ""copy"" and would disappear after the translation is closed. After fixing this I'll give 5 stars."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Since the update took place it leaves this floating icon on the screen which gets in the way. More steps to do a translate which is not good. I prefer the older app. As they say if something not broke don't try and fix it

Stop making extra steps to get a translation. Stop changing the mechanics of getting a translation conveniently. Please!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Lovely and integrates wonderfully with other apps. I love the Touch-to-Translate feature. There are some problems when translating Indic Languages to English. More training data is probably required to fix this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was working perfect but all of a sudden all i get is a ""can't translate, check your connection and try again"" message and now it does not work. It sucks because i practically use the app every day and now it doesn't work"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When it works it's an amazing tool. But when using a VPN the offline translation is dreadful (why?). Besides, with the latest version, image translation is not activated anymore. I'd rather pay for a tool which works in any circumstances than to be limited because of the use of a VPN. Why penalize those of us who don't live in the US?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I didn't like the latest updates after December , you combined chinese traditional and simplified chinese together that was a bad idea for translation moreover for the popup view you removed the pinyin when the chinese characters are copied because of this I have to go to main app to see the pinyin thats irritating please fix this problems."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok. It sometimes does not work which is really annoying, but most of the time it works. Overall, the app is fine, but I only give it 3 out of 5 stars because, as I already said, sometimes it does not work at all.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Back in time we used to copy any text anywhere and the translation app bubble pops up automatically to translate the text and then it disappears, now you have to keep the bubble shown in order to translate, and this is really such a no use factor for the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New design is not good, going back to history take a lot of tapping, previous version the history is just under the screen making it easier to access. I don't hate it, just didn't like the new version"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi developers, bring back the old UI pls, the new one is extremely inconvenient.

User convenience over redesign pls."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Most of my translations need to be for Croatian. In the last week the translations have been horrible!! Causing a great deal of conflict for me and my Croatian friends and family. The translations have so far from what the words are and the translation of the content of a sentence means that it has caused hardship between us. When I reverse translate something I have sent it isn't even close to what I said.Get it together fast. Your app has caused me to almost lose friendships and family. I'm so upset I can't hardly stand it. You have a resposibility to people to get it right!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Works like magic. That said, please add a feature where translated text is placed over the original text on the original image. Long stretches of text with alterating types of formatting can be confusing to read."

And my mom, my dad, my brother all of them uses this app. I think this is the best app that google has ever made. And there is a teeny bitty problem sometimes when you use handwriting if the network is slow it might take some while to translate. If you guys can make it offline it would be much easier. I use english and arabic themost in this app and i think its awesome that we have this kind of app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Don't know how or why but i get messages from all over the world. Google translate allows me to copy and paste the foreign language, indicate what language i think it is, and choose English or French as the language into which it is translated. BTW, there is a plethora of starting languages as well as a myriad of languages into you may wish them translated. Also, i find the translations of languages i know done very well and never outdated nor arcane. Bravo."

The only way I can seem to clear the cache of previously handwritten characters is to tap inside the input box and then start writing again. It makes the handwriting feature almost unusable."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app got unbearable slow. It became so slow that it's faster for me to open the browser and use the regular google search for single word translations. If this will not be solved fast I probably will switch to an alternative.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great. However I had to reinstall it, and now when I select a text in other apps the Google translate is not appearing. It used to be the first option to appear before with translate icon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,billed as being great for offline translation but the list of languages you can download is quite small. Cambodian/Khmer isnt on their list. Also found that when communicating with Vietnamese they could never understand what it was translating. although it did work well in Nepal.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please restore the older version. I used to be able to translate Chinese in instant mode by holding my phone over text. Now I have to take a picture to translate and that doesn't even work. Google Translate used to be amazing.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app works great but i wish that it can also translate pictures in pdf form. 1 thing it should have is to be able to also translate pictures on screen without using the camera or allow it to translate from website pictures just by opening the browser. If not i have to have 2 phone just to translate from a browser picture.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I never had to Google a bad review nor one star this is a first. Google translation needs to be updated. Some of the translation is completely wrong and not to mention embarrassing. A friend wanted me to look up her name in Korean but it gave me woman instead. See the problem translation is the problem not to mention it doesn't even give you complete sentences and improper it doesn't make sense. No one wants to be humiliated when it comes to speaking others languages.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last 2 updates have stopped this app working, as it now always says there is no connection. Have tried closing and reopening the app and also restarting the phone but nothing works. Uninstalling and reinstalling also didn't help. Going to uninstall as it is now just useless junk taking up space on my phone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very useful, convenient, and great, but I do get called out quite often for ""proper usage and grammer"" as it doesn't differentiate very well for local dialects (slang). Overall, great app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Now fixed. Works nicely now. Initially kept trying to translate from Zulu but i didn't specify Zulu anywhere. Problem seems to have disappeared. Very impressive app so far and developers very quick to respond. Thanks.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My first impression was rather poor but since then I have tried it again and found it is much better than I thought. In fact I have even tried using it to translate some Japanese text directly from my computer screen and it worked just fine. So this is an app that I will keep and use.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every update makes this app worse and worse. Slow, new features barely work. It was better when it just had translation and worked efficiently. Now it takes double the tapping of icons to do what was one or two."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new update!! The latest update is a lot more confusing and harder to use. I can no longer see my previous translations below, the design feels a lot less interactive. And I really don't see how changing it like this has made it any better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to Translate bubble no longer appears when I copy text after Android update. It was the most useful feature, which allowed translate to be used with ease, and now there app is back to being clunky and defunct."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every time I open the app, it asks if I want to backup my translations to my Google account. I say yes every time, but then it asks again the next time! Already tried clearing the app cache, then all its storage... Still doing it almost every time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The previous version was better and more user-friendly. After the update, the translations are incorrect and incomplete. COMPLETELY USELESS app now! I have also complained directly by email, too."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Helping me to communicate with my brazil friends by translation. I don't like that updated version. I don't want icon to be displayed when not in use. In old version icon appears only when we copy a text. I need that option
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I liked the layout and user interface better before the last update. It still works fine, but the fact I can't hit the back button on my phone to go back to what I was looking at before, like it used to be, completely changes my opinion of the app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The translations are pretty.. Choppy. Not very good, the grammar and sometimes lettering is autocorrected to something else and makes the sentence sound weird. And most of the time it isn't even what it really said, it's something different."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Everytime I upload an image for the app to translate it crashes before even translating the image at all after one of the apps most recent update. It crashes on my phone a lot but not on the iPad.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"u-dictionary is better than google, at least in u dictionary, google translation conversion is given, but it is given so much in it that the meaning is complete, a little its synonyms come. I will not call it wrong because it needs to be improved because it should be made a kind of dictionary, so all the apps are Chinese, especially all of them will bow before it, brother, it is very important to improve it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Transcribe function has been spotty (been traveling central America and it's not been the most reliable). Also it's weird you haven't made this available for Wear OS. Seems like a no brainer to have it available on a watch.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Gets worse with every update. Why can't we just copy text and have it instantly translated like the previous version? Get rid of the floating icon. Give an option to automatically translate text when copied. Keep it simple Google.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is perfectly fine, but the app icon looks very odd when viewed in Pixel launcher (the circular version of the design). The other Google apps look fine. I hope they update the icon to match the rest."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new layout is really annoying. The ""new translation"" button is where the old ""copy"" button was. So a translation you want to copy gets deleted by inadvertantly (out of habit) clicking the new translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app. With this app,I was able to translate any language which I want to know that word. I learn English and many more languages. Thanks Google. And with this update the understanding of language become easy . I love this app. When my mobile phone storage becomes full , instead of delete this app , I used to delete my favourite game i.e. FREE FIRE. At last I want to say this app is really gorgeous and fabulous....."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very useful..! But tap to translate is irritating in android 10 (stock android phone) You should give both options., 1. Only when i copy text from somewhere it should come in background (As i used in pie) 2.Should run background anytime..,"

Why do I always fall for them?! It was perfect before. Now I need to look for another app that has this function. Edit: For everyone with the same problem. I downloaded the app ""Fast Translator"" which is exactly what I was looking for. Bye Google Translate."

For the last 6 months, this has been just awesome. So much so, I have become dependent on it. So now that it suddenly won't work, I'm very anxious. I came here to get an update or uninstall/reinstall the app, hoping that would fix it. But no such luck."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be good. Lately app takes too long to load, pauses a lot and just freezes when you need it. Also, some translations not always accurate, but that's a minor thing in this case."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In previous version, only selecting text the icon was displayed and pressing it showed the translation, now you have to select text, copy it and then tap the icon, also the icon is always on top, before the icon just appeared when you copy a text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Google translate is my survival kit in Finland. Expert translation on the go. I used this app to translate the items in grocery store as the labels were in Finnish and I could not understand a thing what they were selling in the stores. Google translate was a life saver. Additional features can be to have web search integrated with the translation . E.g. If I translate 'maito ' from Finnish to English... The app can show translation and in addition also show a web search for 'What is maito Finnish?'
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really like this app and especially the over the top translation, however since a few weeks if I press on translate it translates from the detected language to the same one! Why would anyone ever want that? I have set the ""preferred languages"" but it made no difference. I also submitted an feedback report but got no reply. Disappointed."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just kind of took this app for granted. It wasn't until I got a young Mexican child in the group home I work for who didn't speak much English that I saw how valuable this app was. I struggled to communicate with him, then pulled up Google translate which I had previously only used for entertainment. Finally, I was able to help him understand the rules of the house. Thanks, Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most recent updates have made it dependant on other apps. It has lost 70%+ functionality as a complete app unless you want to give Google lens access to everything that's if you even want Google lens in the first place. It use to be great now it's terrible.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad new version. It's not offline anymore. Previously using it offline, I have to press 3 - 4 times until I'm allowed to type the word. Less translations available offline, looking like a cheap way to force me to go online. But now... all gone. Online control"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Worked fine until now (translation is certainly better in online mode than offline, but that is expected). However, in the past few days, it always forces landscape mode which makes a lot of trouble and not comfortable, although my phone has landscape mode turned off."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is disastrous. I agree with all the previous posters. The loss of the the instant reverse translate feature is gratuitous. Just one question, why???? If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good & handy in many situations. Only 1 bad thing: When you click switch languages arrows, then it switches only languages (and leaves text old position). On web version it works normal but app doing this weird thing."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new upgrade is terrible and not user friendly. The user instant translation is terribly aggressive, allowing me no option to highlight sentences or words i want to translate. And worst the space to handwrite hanzi or kanji is too small. Prefered the old version!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Old version is best than new version coz it did not detect language until we choose manually but in previous its detected when we copy from anything it detected automatically so OLD VERSION IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS NEW VERSION I request you to give me old version please if you doesn't give old version then this new version is not useful to anyone it's annoyed
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The permanent opo up on screen disrupt and overlay with our apps,and reading. Not ideal. Highly prefer the previous version pop up when users pressed copy function. Suggest to reverse this function."

When I used it to translate some words and give me the definition, but it always in offline mode. I don't know why, even if our internet connection is ok it's still like that.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is very good for translation also I am a little disappointed with this app becoz we can't translate sanskrit in this app. Sanskrit is the first latin language of India and as we can't translate sanskrit in best app for translation it is very bad .Hope we will recieve any updates regarding sanskrit from Google. Also I am giving 4 star for this reason only.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to love this. Now they place an icon when tap to translate is enabled. It's super annoying and no way to disable it. Tap to translate is the main reason to use this. So now I have to alter system notification settings just to get rid of that damn icon
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Last version before Android 10 was great where the icon only show itself when you copy a text but now the icon is always present and it always blocks the user when trying to press anything on the screen. Please change it back!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your previous tap on translate feature was excellent but The running feature is is not worth much because it is time consuming ( copy and then open one tap and they paste ). I kindly suggest you apdate your running feature and make it time efficient and user friendly.🧐👍
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The best for direct translation and communication. I removed only 1 star because it just translates but doesn't show conjugation of verbs. If you want more options and alternate translations it's more difficult.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Moreover it's awesome...But, I have a small opinion.. Similar to voice translation...If there's a option for audio translation (which had stored or downloaded) with the option of voice translation, it's quite added advantage in translation..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New design is just too confusing. I cant navigate through the app anymore, or find some basic options like swap languages, audio input or camera input. This app used to be so practical and easy to use."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was a great app with accurate translations that could read fine text. After the July 9th update camera could no longer focus to read text that is not large. New translate feature was not worth the reduction in capability.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to translate doesn't work since the recent Android update. I used it 50 times a day, but now I have to keep switching between apps. I could get a permanent notification and permanent buble on my screen, but who on earth could possibly want those?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quite simply, it just doesn't work for real time translation. Only translates about every 5th sentence. It's fine for looking up random words or phrases but that's it. If you need a translator for conversation, this is definitely not the app you want or need."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have a minor problem for the developers. The Google lens has been consistently failing and won't activate my camera. It will allow the Google lens to translate a few times but then it will crash afterwards. Otherwise it works really well
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very laggy at opening. The device freezes when you try to type input for the first time and it can be like that a whole minute or two or... you can decide to force stop the app and wait even more than that...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Used occasionally at work with patients who cant speak English and have not brought a translator with them. Essential when requiring specific information or when giving advice. The voice option makes things very easy.

Plsss i know you guys can do it. It would be more convenient for us"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They changed the camera translate to link to Google Lens, it's now more difficult to select certain text from images as well as extract those texts in their foriegn languages. The old feature to highlight the text you want was better."

It doesn't gives alternative of deleting or question of which translated statement you wanna delete. It also have problem of translation from English to Amharic or the reverse.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad designed. The X to quickly delete the message dissapear when the text is already translated, which makes 3 steps process to write a new text, the X for clearing text should be ALWAYS VISIBLE. and the switch to exchange the translation order too MUST be always visible"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this app.. But sometimes it's not always accurate. It's grest for the most part though. If you are visiting a different country you can use this very easily and this is actually better than the web site for google translate. I like how you can download languages so you don't have to use wifi or data.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The latest app update is horrible. Why the app icon should stay visible all the time? Why it doesn't appear anymore at the moment when I copy the text that I want to translate? And interface in general became less easy to use. Please bring the old translator back
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Take the hint, Google. How many people have to tell you that your ""upgrades"" are making the app less reliable, more invasive, less user friendly, buggier, and clunkier? Maybe Apple users who don't know any better will embrace Lens integration, but the rest of us enjoyed the app when it functioned properly. ...And before you give me the canned response, I have already submitted feedback in your app, just before uninstalling it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay. You can only translate words with it but you cannot translate a sentence because when you translate a sentence, it's translated wrong with a very bad grammar. You can't use this translator to learn a language. It's very bad at this. Please fix the grammar problem !!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This new version is just horrible. I'm not ending to find new intricacies in dayly usage. One of them once I'm scrolling the saved items and I'm typing on one of them to get more translation options or to get a speech out after I'm done the back option taking me to the start of the saved items list.... annoying
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think its a great language tool and used it on Google Chrome browser before even getting the app on my Moto Android phone. Before Google Translate, back in the day you'd have to go to Inlingual or another language school. Unless you took a particular language course at high school or college. Works fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Barely any time to write the word for hand writing. L-rd forbid you don't know Chinese on top of your head, like most westerners. No, the power trippers tell you when you see results regardless you are done writing or not, like a 3 second time out, no option to click translate manually... like, screw you again, Google!! Stop trying to remove humans from the decision process."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A great translation app. I would give 5 stars but I've been consistently experiencing different issues like right now - the bubble that's supposed to appear only when I copy stuff now appears to be a permanent thing.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's adequate for an automatic translator but the issue that annoys me is that offline packages may ONLY be downloaded to the internal phone memory. Installing them on the external SD card is not supported.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update of this APP completely ruined it. Following the update I can't use it without a VPN in China which is very inconvenient. Is there a way to download the previous version? How is it that by trying to improve the APP you've actually made it worse! The previous version was a life saver in some situations here in China, why take something great and ruin it?!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty cool stuff, but a lot can be lost in the translation unless communication is keeps simple. Very useful but avoid complex sentence structure and run on sentences."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really good translator, although the sentence after translation is mess up I can still deal with it. But when I use the ""camera"" feature the characters/letters I want to translate is clear and obvious but still recognize wrong!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was fantastic until the last software update now it sucks the tap to translate does not work so you have to go from one app to another and paste to get the translation then back again which is very slow, annoying and inconvenient to say the least. This needs to be fixed ASAP"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Now following some form of update it is rubbish. It used to save history so now i have to keep repeating the typing time and again. Some jobs worth thinks it better. Give us the old one back it was great. Some idiot just replied saying i have to press more buttons. I did and it hasnt saved all the old history. Why change a good system.... WHY??
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"(Update- A lot quicker and none of the things mentioned in the other post that I initially agreed with about the problems encountered by others Devs,as you should already know ""if it isn't broke don't mess with it. But I still suggest a beta program for Google translate. In the short and long run it'll help getting feedback before releasing updates."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Is fast but a nightmare. Conversation is wrong most of the times, the ai should learn for another few decades. One solution would be to have at least 2 simultaneos translations to be able to verify if one of them (a known one) is correct."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new feature is suck. It's just good at visual, but useless. It won't automatically translate to the right language. But, when it's already in the right language it won't translate either."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is easy to see both translation. 2-you don't use or press different keys. 3-comfortable to use camera and translate text as a whole. 4-save words. 5- Web design is simple for user. Thank you well done!!!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The import feature of it doesn't work at all i know this because i got some games that were in Japanese on my phone and i took a screenshot to try and translate it but it never works and just freezes and then the screen turns black and i have to exit it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The awesome App that I ever seen. I was trying to get app for translate Hindi to English. The exam was near I was don't know what's the chapter telling about .... At that time I found this translater. The new camera option is very useful to me. I hope all of you also like this. Thanks Google for developing this App... But something went wrong to the recognition... You have to check it....
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi, please bring back old functionality where only if you copy text, then the tap to translate icon appears. Right now I have to have the icon on all the time. Please have an option to switch between old and new functionality. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Awful voice recognition. Instant camera translation still need more improvement. But seriously, the voice recognition is a huge turn off, while I'm intending to use it for my comfort, but all its done is ruined it instead."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Moved to Japan recently and this app has been very beneficial. The conversation and camera translation feature is straight forward. I only wish I could place calls and have the conversation feature available. Plus there are no ads!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Works well, but won't shut down! Exit out, close all apps, it is still running and using battery. Have to go into App manager and do a force close to get it to shut down."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Well thank you! Just curious though why you guys kept that feature hidden instead of putting it on the front. It would be really convenient to just select what kind of english accent you want to have. just like Google translate used to be.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,this app was so good. until the recent updates. its not focusing properly and there is no way to disable the instant scan feature like in the previous versions. i hope they fix this and not make it worse.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,its very difficult that everytime we are into a new page in google chrome its automatically getting translated. very bad updation. Because of that issue i uninstalled the app but still its getting translated automatically. very bad app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Doesnt pick up all the text in picture and when trying to translate languages like Japanese or chinese it really messes up the translation. Also the camera keeps going in and out of focus with not movement
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's been difficult to translate to the point of being updated. You can't write more words and characters. Earlier I could translate paragraphs but now I can't. By writing a big paragraph, you see the maximum character exceded. And you can't translate long paragraphs. so i am giving only 1 star."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please if it possible to check the voice command on the app, It was working absolutely fantastic... And from a week the voise comands ist if not 100% wrong then 96%very good app I believe that someone should repair it.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An error showed off out of nowhere (check your connection and try again) I'm online and all other google products are working just fine, I reinstalled the app, nothing works. Ps: downloading and using offline language packages work just fine despite the error, it is the online translation that doesn't work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ths app is the best, totally loved it, its very easy to navigate and use and sometimes i *do* take a picture of my textbook and it reads them for me, every word is spot-on what the audio says, and im really satisfied with this app the audio clear enough and i totally loved it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The speech to text feature and the conversation are horrible. The mic icon shows that it hears me, but it won't translate. The camera translate is pretty great though."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is missing simple yet common translations in German like watering cans among others when used offline,also it would be great to add offline camera translations,otherwise it is surprisingly handy and simple. Yours,Matthew."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nani!? I just downloaded Spanish Language to be able to use it in offline but the only thing that appears in Offline Translation is ""Downloaded Languages"" and ""All Available Languages"" and I was not able to find the language that I just downloaded. I tried clicking the two of them none stop but nothing is happening if you wouldn't mind can you please enlighten me on what should I do or it's just broken. :/"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before the update, there was an ""enter"" feature in the translate column. But after the update, the feature is gone. If you want to translate, it's a hassle, you have to delete the sentence that has been translated first."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the last update, when I speak sentences, it does a partial translation before I can finish. It keeps cutting me off and won't let me complete a thought. Speaking faster or slower does nothing to correct the problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New version is rubbish! Can no longer select copy/paste Pinyin. Two clicks to do certain actions instead of one. Looks prettier but it's gone backwards for usability and features.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app. I have a friend that is from Mexico and he didn't speak any english when I met him so that was what we used. It helped us both and it was alot of fun watching him get excited about being able to communicate with non spanish speaking people. Use it it's great.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The mails no longer load automatically once you click on a message. You have to click several times until it refreshes and slowly loads the message. Previous versions never did that.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New UI upgrade is not functional for split screen or multitasking. Before the recent update I could use split screen while chatting however now it's Imossible. I see no way to revert the ui back, as this UI has everything huge"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This last July 2023 release has really botched the better options under earlier version - no meaningful options for copy, paste icons like before. I'd expect the change to allow easier navigation but background is just unnecessarily distracting."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Half the time it just doesn't respond, or even worse, picks up half the conversation and then fücks up and goes awry. It's garbage to use for any meaningful translation purposes. Best fit is novelty and that's when it decides to work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello @google Last update of November has some issues as all of my downloaded languages do not work, even I can't get access to the offline translation folder.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very useful, I wish I could dl the audio for the languages to use offline as I didn't have data when I used it most often. The text was sufficient more often than not, but offline audio would have made it that much better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best and most useful app on my phone. I use it constantly, almost daily, and I can't think of another app which provides me with as much useful and self-improving information about my world and the cultures around me. Both a vital tool and a favorite pastime. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Floating Dock is unusable on note 20 ultra, no real control over when it appears or disappears. All permissions allowed. Just have to use the main app in split screen when using WhatsApp. Wish there was a more polished way of having translated text conversation in 2020"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Quick audio translate works fine but is very sensitive about timing. Continuous translate gives no output no matter what I try. Basically useless to me for audio in its current state, though image scanning is fine."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works pretty well when translating from Japanese to English, although the writing keyboard tends to insert the letter before I'm done writing. Also, the app frequently inserts the wrong handwritten letter, even if the letter was drawn almost perfectly."

The floating option was the most convenient way to use , which has restricted is now from using the floating option .

So I changed my review 5 star to one star ..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Finally had my first conversation with my Maid in Mexico using conversation on translate!! Definitely better. When I first started using it a few years ago the translations were off. Now the translation between Spanish and English is better, I can use more complex descriptions instead of saying things very basically. The conversation worked fairly well other than when it translated condom when I was telling my maid how to cook the jumbo shrimp."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap to translate no longer works. I used to be able to copy a message and just click on the floating icon and it would auto translate. Now I have to paste in what i copied and manually choose English to translate to. Complete rubbish. Why mess with something that was already good 🤦🏽‍♂️
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After updating to Android 10, tap to translate icon remain on screen constantly instead of diapering after the translation action. If I move it to X and close it, it won't pop up for the next translation when copying text. I have the latest version of the app. Not good Google!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stopped working for me recently. It's possible to translate only first word after launching the app. After that app is not working. To translate another word, you have to restart it. Loved this app, but now uninstalled it. I'm very disappointed. Reinstalling didn't help."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Hi ...this app is ok but I mostly. need to.translate pictures and often need to use the import from gallery option and its not there when i need it soo bad...this is a disappointment to me.....I have written to Google to always allow those options to no avail...please do something about it..I am running out of options.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The last update is terrible usability wise. Less vertical space for handwriting. Dragging a grabber in the middle of the screen to bring up the history is counter intuitive and error prone.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very poor..i think if we want to translate into another language.it is not showing the correct meaning of what we mention there,it is showing absolutely wrong answer or another meaning..it really pissed me off,when i try to send a message in another language(spanish) using this google translator to my foreign friend..he said what you typed in the message..i copied the result translation and again translated to english it showed another sentence totally changed the meaning.very poor translation"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down, one of the best apps I've ever had thank God for this app so many times so often whether you're expecting to need it or not it's always there for you. I've had so many great vacations that probably would not have been so easy or enjoyable without this 1 Google app. Bless Google. (Minus the fact that Google put out the Google home mini and Google home Nest products. Dumbfounded by such abominable failures. It should be taken to court for absolute incompetence. Long Live Alexa there."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has stopped functioning and isn't translating anything since the update. Keeps popping a message of a ""network error"" but that's incorrect. It's been quite sometime now and surprised that Google hasn't resolved the issue in a timely manner."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One of the best translators, but i hate that the text entry box always contracts to a single line. If text entry worked like the web version, i'd give 5 stars. Note in response to developer: there is no help+feedback item on main menu."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,most of the times im using google translate for checking spells and when i copying a text it sucks that i can't copying correct sentence from floating icon and i have to open main app for doing that! also we cannot switch languages in floating icon immediately! its a very usefull future but have simple problems that is awefull..
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As always, when some useful apps make full changes, will be less user friendly, the new design look really nice I must say but trust me, not user friendly at all as the previous design. I believed user friendly much important than look."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My review got deleted for some reason... basically this new update sucks and i deleted the app. Edit: thankfully the tablet version hasn't been updated and I removed auto updates, hope that works.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For phones with camera removed, the camera option to translate is completely blocked off which is just dumb.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Is it only my problem, when I translate some text and than trying to make some corrections, I see only two strings of my text? Why I can't see whole text block during the corrections? The rest of the screen is empty."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its translations aren't always accurate but it does the trick. I also love the added features like the camera for quick translations and being able to download a language pack to use offline.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It struggles a lot with Japanese, giving odd translation results. It also can't handle Japanese unless it's written horizontal. If it's written vertically, as is common in Japanese, it won't translate."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent way to watch news around the world and understand what they are saying. It's not perfect and will shut off or stop recognizing speech often. By second or third try it usually works.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a remarkable app that made our recent trip so muxh easier. I have no Portuguese but with it i could talk to people and get the help i needed when my wife was sick. Fabulous. I could explain to the room cleaner that my wife was sick but to do the bathroom so much easier than just waving my arms around and using garbled spanish! Its not perfect in conversation mode but still deserves 5*

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good, but translates less accurately than Google Assistant's Live Translate/Interpretor Mode/Live Transcribe, which are also Google products. Maybe this means that G Translate is using a different translation source or method than Google's Live Translate. You can test this for yourself. Translate a sentence in the Google search bar (which now uses Live Translate) and then translate the same sentence in the Google Translate app, and you will see that the translations are different."

That is an automatic template response that you use in these reviews. No I will not submit feedback to your product team, when they can simply read my original comment. This is not a suggestion but a critique of your product."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The latest update is just horrible. The text is way too large. The auto translate button does not automatically pop up on my screen anymore. Like we went back to 2001 with the technology here. Do something please.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wish it would show a picture under the nouns and verbs. It would at least, give us some kind of hint as to where the translation may have gone wrong. For instance, ""My son is sleeping."" If I see a 🌞 instead 🧍, in both languages, then I will know what to correct or try express a different way. Another example: ""You broke your tooth and need a crown."" If I see 👑, it may help me realise that I should say "". . . and you need a new tooth 🦷."""

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's annoying when a useful feature is removed. Why get rid of split screen capabilities? It's helpful to do this when translating text thay can't be copied.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This translator app seems to work wonderfully and can only imagine how helpful it would be when traveling to new countries where English is not the primary language spoken. I highly recommend Google Translator.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was 100% better when you touched the screen and it was translated immediately, I hate that bubble on my screen permanently, or having to scroll down on the screen and tap again to get translations, more procedures in my opinion and less effectiveness"

So, I'll just chime in with the rest of the thousands of people that complained about the ui change. If you want to fix this, just change the ui back, there's no further discussion needed. I just checked, the new ui looks like ""adjective"". Oh, and pro tip for you ""creativeholes"": Users hate it when you change the ui. Usefulness trumps design on something that is meant to be useful. Unless you are saying that this app isn't useful."

I got the Google one, which I should have from the start but didn't see the camera function. I'm just trying to translate characters/words idk on a controller, that I am thankful to get that is within my parameters and price range.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm in Ukraine using Google translator as an English speaker and it can only translate individual words that don't make up coherent sentences in Ukrainian. Sometimes it does not even translate the words correctly. The same is true when a Ukrainian is using the translator app to speak to me. This app is quite useless!! Also voice to text his awful!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's so nice app and I liked it so much. There are many languages. But I am suggesting and requesting you to add a language that is SANSKRIT. Yes this language which is used in many schools as a subject in India. And it would be educational for us. So please accept my request and add the language SANSKRIT in it. Then I will give you 5 stars.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Oof brutal update. Hard to put into words how unuser friendly this update is. Favorites are hidden and not at the bottom not easy to switch between languages when you've already typed out a word.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Literally only use this app to translate pictures and this stupid Google Lens update just screwed it all up. Get rid of it entirely or just give us the option to use the old functionality. Lens can't translate for anything, and no one uses it to begin with. Just pull the plug on it and stop adding garbage no one asked for to your apps."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok, alot of translation is wrong. I can see this. How? I will translate something simple right? Lets say if I translate yes (for example) it will translate no. The way I found this out is that I copied the translation and put it on. It gives me something else I dont want. Not all the translations are peefect. The one example I just gave isn't true, but it seems like the other translations. Say that your translating something big. On some parts, it will put some things wrong. Inprovements please?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi google, love this app, use it all the time. I live in a bilingual house hold so this really helps. A feature that you need to add is the ability to slow down the audio translator in the foriegn language. Cheers."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a pretty good app no question but the main thing is when you convert Japanese texts in games to English the whole translation thing goes wrong and doesn't make any sense . Overall it's a great app
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like with all things ""google"", less and less useful. It no longer shows alternative translations so you can't pick the exact meaning you were looking for. Simplicity over usefulness."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the new design is awful it is like designed to be a kids app which is not. I like the previous design. and something to consider in this version is that the popups became bigger which is not a good thing to read snd translate. after all the new version is awful hope you fix all the issue that I mentioned here

Also the icon appearing all the time on the screen n if i hide it i cant translate directly. I hope u change these two things back to what it was. I also hope u would include hebrew in the voice setting. This is a great app except for these three problems. Please do something about them. I am giving 5 stars anyway.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm going to uninstall it. For hackers only. I've been playing this game ever since it was played on the computer. Now it is being played on mobile and the spread of immorality has increased. Some hackers can win without letting others play. Again some threw 8 balls earlier and won. I lost my 15 lakh rupees at the hands of these hackers. So solve this problem or cancel this game. Or remove hackers from this game. And whithout this problem the game is still best.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Offline translations isn't letting the app work properly.

Now either I leave the pop up on the screen all the time,or I copy what text I need translated,exit that and enter it myself in the translator. Obviously,neither of the options aren't as good as before on Android 9. So maybe there is something that can be done here?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be better. It used to show explanation and similar words or phrases translation. Now its just dumbed down. And even the history is not on the main page you have to gk look it up separately which is inefficient
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very useful. I'm using it for several years now and I am very happy with it: it has done me very good service, especially between french and english, but also in the other languages I do speak.

Im pretty sure one person switching translators won't hurt a company like Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new update is very difficult to use from the previous where is saved the languages you most. Now for every translation using an app you have to change the languages back & forth. STOP TRYING FOX SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT BROKEN!!!!!!

Please make google translate easier for us to use....my theme font properly working on previous all version & my theme font is not working on this new version.... this is also awkward
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's nice but the camera translation is rubbish . It always shows something else while translating. Once I tested the camera translation and it translated wrong way. The meaning was something else and it showed something else . The translation of the camera is very very poor 👿👿😡😠
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I can't tell you how many times I have experienced the app completely stop working after speaking into it for a translation. Having to constantly restart the app gets really annoying after a while.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app can translate foreign menus for you by you just holding your phone over the menu! How great is that? Many people don't realize this capability. Plus the obvious capability of translating one language to another. Powerful tool.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How did you screw this up? I loved this app, especially the tap to translate. My wife's family is Colombian, so lots of Spanish in our texts. I could simply long press the text, copy, the button would pop up, tap it, and bam! Translated. Then the icon went away until I copied something. Now you want to keep the icon on my screen the whole time? And a drop down menu entry? You guys went stupid. EDIT: I don't care why you ruined it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"To use this app as offline, data downloads on external storage (like sd cards). Kindly, let the user decide whether to use external storage or internal storage. And offline audio should be added. However app is working perfectly. Good work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update, Google translate is not working properly. It is not at all translating the content. The issue is only with the app, if we try to translate using chrome, it works properly. Please kindly look into the issue as early as possible."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Last update is amazing. The interface has become just perfect and as convenient as possible. Works quickly and has the possibility of offline translation. Google is great as always. Thanks for your work guys. <3
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This does not work at all, I tried a copy and paste from email to the app you have to translate and it doesn't change a bit. Gosh, I never known something so bad as this. I'll try Microsoft. Anything Google related is just a waste of space"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The user interface used to be top tier, having access to your previous translarions without going directly to the history was very useful. The new visuals are awful."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is OK when online ...........but when I downloaded the Japanese language, it showed that I can browse offline as well . But it shows different meanings when we are online and when we are offline.......plz check and make it better. 5 stars are confirmed (then)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"We all know it's the best translation app and has been since its inception. The new UI is counterintuitive to the goal of helping the user and it's unnecessarily compliacted, pleas return the old UI."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still not listening to us, the ones who ACTUALLY use this app on daily basis?? This new style is NOT ASSERTIVE as the previous one, as it always has been! Please, DO go back to the previous version, that one works just fine and we all agree on that."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Offline transactions are often off (give you the least suitable translation). For example, it translates ""veneer"" as ""лиман"" to Ukrainian in offline mode (which is not the most common translation of the word). But it translates it as ""шпон"" in online mode (correct translation). P.S. Google, stop paying Indians for 5-star reviews, lol)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only thing I really translate is Japanese, a language with a lot of symbols in it, so I have to use the handwriting feature due to how inaccurate the camera can be. However, when I do use the handwriting feature, when I write one symbol after the other (after the first one is already registered and I go and write the second symbol) it duplicates many of the previously written symbols. (Basically if you were to write the equivalent of ""apple"", it would show up as ""aapappapplapple"")"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, if I have too many old translations and I want to see the latest one, I need to scroll all the way to the top see my latest translation. The scroll offset should be set to 0(top), when the history screen is opened."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. I just started working with someone that doesn't speak english and it's cool you can just have it said how it's supposed to be pronounced verbally in the app because you can type in what you want to say and have it be translated to the other individual immediately. however if you want to learn how to speak the new language, it would be even better if it was typed out to show exactly how to prenouce a word. It would help your users to adapting to new the new languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to work exceptionally well, now the camera/picture file scan feature is completely broken except for the horrible ""instant"" feature. Tried clearing cache & deleting & re-downloading but it's still broken."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything was fine before the last update. If the goal was coming out with an update to make people use a different app other than Google translate.. Congratulations you knocked it out of the park. Perhaps take a little more time to see what the people prefer before just shoving ideas into a program and hoping for the best. I know you can't make everyone happy, but I'm afraid to say that the goal was to be sure you don't make everyone happy with the last update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app but there is a problem in it. It translates the word perfectly but if I want to chat with a person with different language and want to write a message of minimum 6 to7 lines it is not possible to send but only 2 lines are being able to send to that person . please do something that it should not have the word limit . Please solve this issue
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,To the editor thank you for your reply I will do that and yes I understand. We were in Italy and austia and used this app to talk to a guy at a wine shop and it worked great. Also used for translating other languages that are no longer really quite popular like Aramaic. However the voice pronunciations are horrible.

We have plenty of languages here in this app to translate the text from one language to another language. We can also use mike to type the words through our voice in any language. Still this has to be updated with many more salient features ;
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the algorithm changes, translations are terrible. App often omits whole sentences from translation, and usually doesn't give any option to select alternate translations. Go back to scraping written sources instead of your poor AI."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent! Can translate books! Can read out loud. Can save in word document or pdf. Format justified. I am very happy. Best app for translation.

Translation process should be like -- 1- select word for translation 2- copy it 3- floating icon of this app should appear everytime."

Edit: Thanks for adding Odia language. But it needs improvement. Some words are wrong and voice search feature and other important features should be there for odia language.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app might demand too much from my phone because it freezing the whole phone for a solid 2 minutes. ( happen the first time I opened the app in the day). Long use is good but using the app for quick search is not recommended. Hope this only occurs in my phone.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very very helpful for me because i have a gf in mexico. I believe that even had i not spoken any spanish i would have been able to comunicate using this app. I have learned more spanish and it also helps with my english grammer. One con is that slang terms and phrases are mostly ignored. I gave it 4 stars for that reason. Overall it has been a godsend. I feel like i can have a girlfriend in any language.

And, I've noticed that the original languages aren't able to be spoken by the app, but I can hear the computer speak caucasoid and mongoloid languages all day. You should be embarrassed by this blatant exclusion. Your lack of alacrity to resolve this speaks volumes as your app has been live for YEARS! Years, and you have no interest in being inclusive to all."

It becomes painstaking after thousands taps..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It does what it's intended and the speech to text function is very neat. I often use speech to text to translate some Japanese phrases and not a lot of softwares are capable of this.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update feb '22 is unbelievably bad. Tap to translate new functionality means floating icon now doesn't appear automatically when text is copied, and text is not automatically pasted. Plus translation windows are silly size."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm learning Japanese. This app almost NEVER gets the translation right. The speaker function cuts out halfway and will only translate half of a sentence. The translation uses katakana words instead of the correct ones. Absolutely terrible. 0 stars.

But the text to speach recognition is sub par. I would expect better from Google of all people. When an app with two reviews currently is superior it speaks volumes about the lazy developers.

But, Google Translate not only helped me figure out vocabulary for daily conversations, but also helped me to just hand the phone over to an Ecuadorian so they cd just speak into the mic. Getting a translation has been an incredible save. I cd not continue living here if I didn't have this app!!!! LOOOOVE."

EDIT: I have stable internet connection speed upto 16mbps and 5-6 gb free memory.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible now. Most unintuitive interface. It was almost perfect the last inception. You are retards. Even the stupid floating tab asking for another translation blocks the frigging translation!! Wow you are dumb. Put it back the way it was !!! It is barely usable now. I hope all the idiots who changed it die slow and painful.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using this google translator for somany years and it was my best until they made a new update which disorganized the app. When you want to use the tap to translator icon to translate it can not dictate any language but the old version does it.

Only in the XVIIIth, more actively in XIXth century, the use of so-called ""Portuguese"" turned a colonial act.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't translate with proper grammer.Eg.If we use (Do with He(instead of #does), it neither changes the meaning of the sentence nor show any error in sentence, I mean to say that ,it should have a function/feature to show grammetical error of the sentence which is written.It doesn't work properly over Wi-Fi and doesn't have meanings of types of Mania,Phobia,Philia,Logy,."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just some before version is very useful like whenever in mobile page when just only thing to do is that copy and then automatically Google translate small window opened and showing translation but now there is always one pop-up notification in notification showing area and not much quick as before.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fyi, I uninstalled/ installed a downgraded version from a safe site. Works like it did. This update is CHEEKS. It feels like a downgrade. Takes longer to translate and then reply to messages. Before it used to know ""hey so and so is speaking X language we know you speak Y language so we will output to Y. Now its dumber and only remembers the last language used making it take more steps. I know covid is effecting work but I didn't know it lowered the overall IQ of a department. Smh"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So it seems like the new Google Translate update makes the ""Tap to translate"" notification visible all the time (it cannot be swiped out).

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Finally after years of being forced to use a MS-DOS style interface Google has finally given us an interface that you can actually use without screaming obscenities at the app. It is hard to believe that the world's largest tech company has been unable to provide more than a two line interface for translating language. Imagine hundreds of millions of people being forced to try and edit text in a tiny two line window. In the year 2022.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"ok just nice apps but can you please fix the translation from English to Malay?

It Changes present tense to past tense and vice versa changes she to he and vice versa, changes girl to boy and vice versa often changes the words completely to give a totally different meaning eg I put my wife's name Thongsa it translates to tongsa which is a severe insult it's as though someone is being deliberately mischievous when programming this app"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It works but when I try and take an image of a Korean article it has no idea what it's doing and fails as a translation app horribly. If it worked I'd give them 5 stars. Taking an image and translating the text is half of the app.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new look and UI makes it way harder to find the words you need, maybe it's just in a apet that I haven't found yet but atleaat I didnt need to look everywhere to find synonyms or similar words before."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Offline translate doesn't work. Translate through camera or gallery picture also not working. Scan picture half way, asked to select text with finger or select all text, both don't work, app then hang and restart without translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Did you even bothered to try this new design on a smartphone? The keyboard covers the translated part and you cannot see the translated text during typing anymore. Only for extremely short texts. Too bad.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It use to be good, but, it deteriorated over the years, lately and when it works, usually not, out of a 3 line sentence, I only get 3 or 4 words translation, and not very accurate."

Can somebody anybody please put it back the way it was before. I don't like it when people change something that I already used to. So please somebody anybody please put it back to the original way it was. I don't like this Google translate anymore so I am going to delete it. So now I have to find another Google Translator.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very useful. Only drawback is Voice theme is inaccurate. Has a hard time replaying the speech you spoken. Very annoying when it can't get the correct word.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Heyy guys,I have many problems with app. The camera is not working. The translation is very bad. Says something else that sounds rubbish.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is good when using. It can translate the language you want it to translate. But it need something else, that is voice translate. So that when someone says something you dont understand you can turn on the voice translate for translation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is good at a normal level because it doesn't translate the sentence properly in a proper grammatical order. If you translate Hindi into English in different forms of present/past/future tense it will translate all in general sentence. This grammatical issue need to be resolved.

The previous version was the best one . I think that I should carry a dictionary with me everytime I'm on the net !!!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Needs an option to force the app to read characters vertically and from right to left. The app still has a difficult time determining the direction of the text.

I am quite sure it's because USA have banned google services for Huawei. so what should I do ? delete it and go for some other app ? because play store won't even let me update anything related to Google."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app update makes it more complicated to use. Before, new translation would change the languages automatically, now i have to go in and change the language myself. Extra steps instead of just leaving alone. It WAS fine. Now i have to find another translator."

And few months ago, I started to use ""apiuni"" which is different platform but I learn a lot. Such as, how to write, how to speak, read with use of phonetic words, and also meaning of words. I am not saying that you should copy all of them's features but some feat. is really important which can be add in this app. So, please try to add more so that it can be useful."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update is terrible, it removes most of the other features like handwriting and only offers conversation mode and camera. It's like they're trying to make it mutually exclusive with the browser version or something... Which is really inconvenient when I'm yknow on my phone?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"what happened to the live translator? Used to be able to hold my device up and it would translate with out having to 1st take a photo...

But there is need more improvement in Indic languages i think, even in 2023 people still make fun off it's robotic voice and transilating old language style ( especially Malayalam) so the lattest generation could'nt get it even if it's there mother tongue. Hope you do well soon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love and use it..! But still different aspects to improve. Like to mention one: 1. It amalgamates all paragraphs into single one. It creates huge inconveniences when longer texts are being translated..!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad Japanese translations so, a worthless app. Typed in roku, and it translated that to English as ""roku"" instead of ""six"". Typed in ""six"" and it told me the Japanese translation was ""6"" which is a worthless translation. This is one of many examples I tried."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can your team change the app back to the last format until they fix the bugs? We have to work harder for the same results. Before we were able to send longer text messages. Afte the update, messages has to be sent as multiple texts."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works, but seems buggy on my Xperia 5. It is like it is constantly firing the auto focus or flicking the exposure up and down. Makes it very difficult to read what is being translated."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's incorrect most of the time, can't even translate basic words. It confuses languages and often give the translation in the wrong language. There are a lot of issues with this app and if you point it out they just tell you to do their job for them."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app changing was radical, initially we can't find the things we want doing, but after some minutes using the app we realized it became great! Hi everyone, give a chance to app, it's great now! The only thing missed is the automatic keyboard language switching, like before!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So my 1 star is for the google lens taking a picture & translating it. It used to work fine before the last update. now it's garbage. It was so useful to take a picture of a menu & get the translation. Now I'm left to type & ask what is available instead of just seeing it right away. Others have asked why you took this feature away. Instead of answering the question. The person in charge of replies here does a copy and paste of what they are bringing to the app. Answer the question and fix it!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The camera translations are awful and it cycles through several words. When I take the same words and manually type them in, then a semi usable translation occurs. Forget the camera translation, it is trash."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Easy to use when connected to wifi or via cell service data. Much more limited when offline... fairly intuitive to use. I recommend practicing with app online and offline before you need to use in real life.

It’s disgusting. Please do corrective and neccesary action immediately.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Mostly good. Really helpful when it works. Instant translation requires frequently uninstalling and re-installing the app. Works like a charm for a little bit after downloading again.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A decent enough translator, despite its faults. The thing that the app needs in 2019 is a material theme refresh. It's one of the few major Google apps to not undergo a redesign."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Google Translate is great to have. It helps me figure out Japanese words that is important to know on the instruction when I'm building my Gundams. But now it's giving me a little trouble now because when I try and scan on my instruction that I need to know it won't Translate the word that need to know. But I think 🤔it's still great to have. I just have to figure out what went wrong. So I'm going to try and up date it and see if it works. But I really do hope it works.

It's also great If you insert formal or informal, I'm using korean-english-japanese. Some countries are quite sensitive with the word respect, again I don't want trouble.

It seems to just be a front-end to the Google Lens ""app"", which appears to be embedded into the main Google app, which wants always-on access to the camera.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You guys ruined this app. It was easy to use. Just one tap to translate and now you gotta copy the text and tap for new translation and then paste the text and tap for translation again. You serious? Who gave you that stupid Idea? I mean is that a joke? It's the most annoying app now. Updates are meant to make things easier. You guys did total opposite. Pathetic.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I miss the old Google Translate UI/UX design. Now it became more complicated. Please bring back the old one. I have been using google translate since 2013 on the web and on the phone. The phone app was so cool and useful, now it's not."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I never leave feedback but I am not liking the new version of it at all. Some things that I am not liking is the way it is designed now. The entering text and everything isn't as simple as before. Also the history. It doesn't delete. Please get the old one back. I use this app everyday now things are getting harder.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app does not launch anymore. This began after installing the most recent Android update a few days ago (August 5th, 2020 patch). I really on this app everyday, so this is incredibly disappointing. Pixel 2 (all apps and os are up-to-date)."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app very handy to use, I especially love the part where you can just write down the language to translate it, it's a great app to study and learn how to write to translate a language, but every thing has its downside sometimes the app's translations doesn't make any sense and sometimes when I write down something to translate it auto corrects the way I wrote it that just makes everything frustrating, but atleast I can learn how to read and write, right?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update made this program very hard to use. The popup icon that was so useful is now either always on or always off. The ui is now way more bulky and harder to use. Scrolling is always necessary. Edit: Weeks later and still no attempts at making this better. Time to move on
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"used to work. now doesnt. i type in the word i want to translate..and then it gets stuck at loading screen. ive tried the basic troublenshooting like restarting, deleting data and cache. even uninstall and reinstalling. still didnt work"

It doesn't look that they translate directly between the chosen languages but they may use english as a middle step. Do not trust the given results, and the application y awful, I do not belueve that the people that developed this application really use it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Agree with others that it's good for vocab (Japanese) but not full sentence structure. My app shortcut also constantly disappears from my screen. Poof! Every few days it deletes itself...very odd.

The job transcription feature I use, it writes half of it in the first place. Meaning if I say anything, he writes only half of it."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used this app mostly for Japanese text. Now with this new update the ability for it to detect Japanese has been heavily crippled. It is useless to me now. The new ui is also rather unintuitive.

But the App to me is a form of communication that could simplify your life in many ways.In all honesty, I came back to rate again, as I said about my dyslexia. I was just being polite, but not used the App fully to describe it in detail, all I know is, have used it for the Philippines and nobody has not understood me. Thank you"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You cannot rely on this app to be accurate at all even when you type your words in when you reverse it with the translation it doesn't say the same thing that you had typed in I had to redo a sentence for sentence repeatedly before I had it right I had it proof read by a friend when I was finished and as many times as I had to correct it I'm glad I reversed it and double checked I wrote a lot of letters before I learned this no telling what I said to them
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App was great, then stopped working. Doesn't translate, says it's a network connection. I'm on wifi at home and on my network. The online version from the browser won't work for me either"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I used this app since years ago. When I change the translating language keyboard automatically changes to its language (if I already have it). As a example when I try to transtale Japanese word keyboards language changes to Japanese. Im using Google keyboard. Can fix this issue

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Last update wasn't good for me and my family members and friends also mentioned that new interface looks strange and uncomfortable to use. Before it was amazing and so user-friendly. I hope you consider my opinion and opinions of the other users.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is really helpful in translation. But i need the more like if I m reading some article on any site or any pdf.i need some thing right there who show the meaning of particular word or translate whole sentence quickly just by selecting the sentence.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It truly provides a really good way to show what you're saying or what someone else is saying and you can even edit the dialect for the different types of Latin American Spanish. And for that I'm very grateful because oftentimes whenever I have my husband with me I can show him what he needs to do or say versus just telling him he can actually feel active
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst update ever! I'd prefer the UI before the changes, as long as it functions! No corrections when word is wrong, no floating icon anymore, it doesn't remember the languages I usually use. Unreliable app since the update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A dictionary feature would be more than welcome. And the addition of contextual translations for words or idioms would be much more interesting than the current state of the app. Just check what Reverso does.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update from 31.01.2022 is horrible, the translator gives one word only instead of a big variety of translations (as it was before the update) and I find it really inconvenient. Please change it back."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It often translates paragraphs incorrectly. But it did me a lot of good.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think this is app is good and easy to use. However, every time I try to take a picture of something to translate, it crashes and reboots my phone. Not sure why or the cause of it but it sure is annoying. I hope it gets fixed soon."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have starred/saved probably over 3000 translated phrases and this is why the mobile and web app have huge problems displaying them correctly.

Unfortunately, this is not what I need. Have not tried voice but from what I have seen of prior versions I doubt it will be able to even translate baby talk for kid's TV shows. Again, a work in progress..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google has really fallen down the proverbial ladder. Their talk-to-text apps are terrible!!!? I mean they can't get anything right! You spend more time correcting everything it got wrong than you do actually using it. It renders Google translate practical useless. And all because they think it needs updates to do what? I swear the software engineers and IT people are some of the dumbest on this planet.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have never left review on an app before but i want someone to read it because this app STOPS recording every time a speaker takes a pause! Humans pause while speaking! This does not mean that they are done talking! I use Google translate on my phone, but when the person speaking takes a breath, the app stops translating? What is even the point of that? Why include an automatic stop? Would it really hurt anyone if it kept translating until someone presses a stop button to stop? I mean Jesus."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Same thing as everyone else: new layout is terrible. What was wrong with the old one? Not simplified enough, you guys? Also, now whenever I try to remove a phrase from my Saved, it just comes right back. Good job."

Or is it not possible to fix the errors?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just awful. You gotta be kidding with this update. Everything was so easy with the old system. Why did you have to make it so complicated now? It is nearly impossible to translate in real time now. When iam trying to have a conversation with a client or friend it takes 3 times as long now to translate it. What in the heck were you guys thinking. Please go back to the other set up. Please!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This application is absolutely useless. For some languages (as Icelandic) it is the only option to try to understand some words. But Google Translate seems to find very funny or intelligent, I don't know, to try to guess other languages like Croatian, Gaelic, Swedish or even Spanish! When I say that it is Icelandic AND when the word exists in this language, why does the not not believe me??? Sometimes innovations are not worth it at all. I am very disappointed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works pretty well, though there are definitely still limitations (especially if you are translating a language with a smaller population, like Ukrainian). Any chance we could see this pushed to Wear OS? It would be incredibly helpful to be able to translate from a watch."

Since this stupid update you can't use it to make transliterations into different writing ststems anymore... which was one of the primary uses I had for it. Now, if you type a word (example ""XZY"") to make a pun, it will FORCE-AUTOCORRECT TO ""XYZ"" AUTOMATICALLY, WHILE ASKING YOU ""Did you mean ""XYZ""?"" with no way whatsoever to say ""no, I actually meant ""XZY"", exactly the way I typed it!"". 🤬 ZERO 🤬-ing STARS 🤬!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's nice that it can translate to many languages, but I seem to have a problem here, For example, if I translate ""Thyme"" into bangla, it littieraly spells Thyme in bengali, not translating it.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be fantastic, now it sucks! Why do I need Google Lens to use the translate function? Why would a simple translation be tied to my account? I don't want Google Lens on my phone and I don't want my translation requests to go to Google. I shouldn't be forced to be logged into my account to translate something. It's dumb. Google wants waaaay to much information. I will not use this app anymore. There are other ones just as good without asking for identifiable information."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how I'm able to communicate with others in a different language! I once set and had a conversation with someone with just my phone translating for almost an hour! They could not understand English and I could not understand Spanish but my translator made the conversation seem so fluent! It reminds me of the Star Trek communicators with a built-in universal translator.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please add a feature for gender sensitive languages! (For example French, Russian, Hebrew etc) this means languages that use different spelling for the same word when referring to male or female. For example in Russian ""do you understand?"" When speaking to a man would be written ""Ты понял?"" But for woman would be written ""ты поняла?"". In Hebrew for example would be written ""?אתה מבין"" for man or ""?את מבינה"" for woman. In Hebrew both the first word (for you) and the second word (for understand) change so this makes the translation completely different. There should be a checkbox to indicate when inputting text to translate, does the user wish to translate for speaking to which gender? 1. Translate for a man 2. Translate for a woman. Also in Russian and French there is a difference as to how you say the word ""you"" depending on the status of the person you are speaking to. For example in Russian if a person is unfamiliar or a stranger or someone highly respected you would refer to them as ""you"" translated ""Вы"" but if you were speaking to a friend you would refer to them as ""Ты"" instead and this is hugely important! Because if you refer to specific people in the the wrong term they would get offended! So there should be an additional feature for checkbox to indicate am I speaking to someone familiar or a stranger. These features are essential and would never be solved by AI because unless the user specifies 1. What gender they are speaking to 2. What relationship that person they are speaking to has with them, only then can the app understand whom they are speaking to and translate correctly! Of course this app was primarily created by English speakers and in English the above issues aren't present, we use ""You"" for everyone; a teacher, a friend, a parent, a man and a woman with no difference! Please fix this and add these features urgently as the lack of these features makes your app very lacking and not very usable!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DONT DOWNLOAD TILL THEY FIX THE TAP FEATURE RUNNING IN BACKGROUND！ This app still is not working as it should and does not auto transate text. Two updates ago these updates made this app less usable and will continue to get bad reviews as you guys screwed it up. Put it back！！ MS translate can be used to if I have to copy and paste now and take extra steps. what engineer/dev op would make this app worse？ fired as on this second update on my phone today still does not work like it did...fail！！
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It works ok, but sometimes it doesn't type what I speak to eat and have to speak a certain way for it to type what I need to say. But the app is very helpful knowing how to adjust how i speak to it. Hopefully they can make a app that can automatically translate languages into English from any language."

Please, if you want to speak English in small time⌚, I swear, this app can helps you in your English studies. I appreciate and I'm very grateful to all people who have made this app for us. Now, I understand that English is very easy. It's possible to speak English in three 3️⃣ months."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,One useful feature I would appreciate is the ability to change the text to speech translation speed. A slower speed would help users like myself learn phrases and languages more easily.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to work really well a few yrs ago translating what someone is saying. Now it's just plain broken in translating simple English. I am deaf and it's becoming harder to use this app for the simplest help in understanding what someone is saying using this app for many different situations. Getting a help to resolve this is impossible.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lowered my last month review from 2 stars to 1 after returning and seeing Google has not fixed this disasteous new version. Most reviewers who used the prior version are dumbstruck by how this once great translator has been turned into junk.(Google seems to be sitting on their hands as if they want to drive users like myself away to other translators.) Perhaps the few who are giving this app good reviews are 1st time users who don't know any better for lack of something else to compare it to.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. It took longer to install the app than it did to translate the Latin phrase ""Inter faeces et urinam nascimur"" into English - ""Among the feces and urine we are born."" I will use this app DAILY. Not only to translate Latin, (admittedly rare) but also German, French, Spanish, and any other languages that I encounter."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many incorrect translation done by this app. I have send so many incorrect translation as a feedback for improvement purpose. More and more improvement needed in traslating into ""hindi"" hire one who know very well hindi as well as english which makes error free translation when some one send feedback as a wrong translation. Or develop AI which are able to correct by comparing by using movie."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has OCR (image, from camera, to text) functionality, Live video OCR, including handwrite recognition and Google translate acts like a human translator; it can listen to a conversation in two languages and translate, live, and read aloud the translation. update: On my Zenfone 2 after pressing the camera icon, it takes about 30 seconds to start displaying an image."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You now have to paste every you want to translate. It use to do it automatically. You also now have to clear it each time. It doesn't auto detect language anymore. I would use this app every day for hours but now it's trash. I have already sent feedback in the app. I highly suggest changing these features back. The new look I don't like. If anyone knows another app that is good please tell me
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap to translate is bad on android 10. Having the icon on all the time is not a good solution. A really bad decision to remove the clipboard watcher instead of letting users choose what app can access it. I thought Android is about choice.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why can some devs fail so utterly and egregiously? The app and many functions now broken. The UI is terrible. It's simplified to the point of being useless. I hate when devs do the ""we have to change SOMETHING to look like we are doing something. We have to stay employed!"" That faux productivity that ruins everything. They literally don't even use their own apps. The underlying code and translations are extraordinary. Yet the simplest thing, the interface, they break on a whim."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but the camera function is just awful it translates it but it shows the text oddly, and stretches it in an odd way and the translations are wrong sometimes. So 4/5 until they fix the odd camera functionality."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I Hate* this app because it doesnt allow you to COPY the translation..... if you wanted to copy and past the words that you translated, you will not like this App. Further more, when it translates Japanese, it displays the Kanji clearely, but of course if YOU CANT READ KANJI (likely why your translating in the first place) this app cuts off the translation written in letters so you can only read a small portion of your desired translations. Did the makers of this even try it?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please do not direct me to the incorrect suggestion webpage. Everyone will know there is no problem to copy and paste the words inside the Google Translate Android App. The problem is the new version Google Translate App for Android 10 does not work directly on any .pdf files after you even just marked 1 word you want to translate. The Google Translate works well on Android 9 whenever you mark the any words directly on .pdf files. Please fix your Google Translate App for Android.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google seems to have taken a step backwards with this app recently. The tap to translate button used to auto-hide and pop up only when I would copy and paste text. Now, in order to use it the button is visible 100% of the time; even if there is no intent to use it. Nobody needs that stupid button in the way when not in use. It should be invisible until prompted with a copy/paste action like it used to be. At this point I've turned it off. So why use the app at all and not just go to Google?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is much better since the website takes longer load (which is personally better for me). Unfourtunately, when I use the camera to translate words in real life, it uses different fonts which makes it illegible for me. I hope this changes in different versions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't work on Pixel 2. You enable ""Tap to Translate"" and nothing happens. You have to cut and paste every message manually into the app. Painful experience. It's laughable that Google tech is so bad especially on a Google phone."

I really, really dislike the way the app works now."

I also have dictionary to describe the meaning. The translated word or sentence also can be play out for the pronunciation."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very nice app but some of the words translated from English to Spanish are Castillian Spanish, not colloquial Mexican Spanish. Aside from that, it's a great little app. Just needs a little tweaking that I would be happy to assist you with. This helps many ESL kids that can't attend classes because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Well done!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new interface is not intuitive, it is unnecessarily hard to switch languages. Worst update by far, I don't know why they don't just rollback and reevaluate the design upon the given recent feedback."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The previous version of this app was much better than this new version. In that old version I can copy the pronunciation of the words and also that tap to translate option was really helpful. But this new version is so dull.

Everything you want to do is there. Now I have to find my way to it which is just frustrating and like screw this app.

They could speak directly into the app and I would sorta get what they were saying. I can not blame the app for not understanding dialect and local phrases (Never tell a Japanese girl to make you miso soup unless you intend to get married). I do wish that there were more Native American languages on the app as I teach classes with Indigenous peoples. Other than that, great all around app."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Used this app to communicate to a Spanish speaker! It was pretty cool and easy to use.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,New update layout looks ugly and unfriendly and also no indicator on where your text history is and text has doubled in size and so it is harder to double check what you have written with the translation! Also why does it no longer display Pinyin as that was very useful.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,If I only had to choose one word about my experience it would be excellence. A free translator that I personally used many times. I had to download it today to talk to person I met watching the game and yeah it worked perfectly. Not only that but Google is very secure and innovative. I actually plan to work for a tech company but I just don't think they would hire somebody like me so LOL it
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's an okay app. The mic constantly turns off in the middle of a sentence. There needs to be a way to let for the the app to stop translating only when you press the mic button again.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but need an update, Make an update with a quick tool like a small dictionary for home screen, if any body wants to see meaning of any word he have to open the google app or google translate app, these causes waste of time, app users want a tool for home screen which quickly display the meaning of any word at the home screen instead of opening the app. Which help in the improvement of our vocabulary too."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If I could give this less than one star I would. This was a great app until I installed the update. Now it's useless. I live in Africa where we have very limited internet coverage. I used to be able to use this app offline. Now it doesn't work offline at all! UNINSTALLING
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a very powerful application to converts any types of language. It has some problems like here does not show the opposite meaning of the word that you are want to know. So I show one problem but it has a many problems. However it is a cool application 😎.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can study and learn something new and translate it using this application if there are some languages I don't understand and this is very good for me.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old version of google translate is much more better than this sh,it. They removed the full screen function. And whenever you write two chinese characters, the system always duplicates the first character. Very annoying, use another app"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not great, the camera doesn't work as well as it used to. The issue is that whenever I want to use the camera I can't, because I'm not signed in, but whenever I try to sign in it just says I need an administrator but I DONT EVEN HAVE AN ADMINISTRATOR. Each update just feels like a downgrade."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For many years it was a great app, but today (14.01.2023) suddenly it stopped working and showed info that it needs Google App for working. Reinstalled it, worked normally for 10 minutes and info again. So basically it works without Google App, which i personally don't need and don't need to be harassed to install it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a really great translation app. I like how you can text, talk and translate objects with camera. But I wish it would also work offline. It literally does nothing when offline. Obviously I would need it to work offline when I'm in an area with no wifi when talking to someone who doesn't speak english..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app with decent translation. I really love the image based translation, so useful! However, the bookmarked phrases (starred) of all languages are all mixed up. It would be good to show only the bookmarked phrases for the current translation and not the other languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Translated Chinese to English (from Amazon packaging). No issues. I would like the ability to save the translated image; if I pause and do a screen capture I get the ""continue"" message overwriting the image."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap to translate was so vastly superior feature when you just copy a text and the floating icon pops up and disappears. But now it is just so annoying that the icon keep floating on the screen all the time which is so hectic and bothering. Please fix this. That is so not GOOGLE.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a tool to help you quickly, JUST SERVICE, I doesn't know why a part of the users insisted to bring too bad experience about it. Use it to for correction and confirmation about the languages that you already mastered. But to speak for u 🤣, no it's not for speaking. contribute in the improvements by suggesting the corrections and get your work done. Google Translate is a great service will not stop the improvements and great work is already achieved and I thank you GOOGLE TRANSLATE TEAM."

First, I would like to appreciate your great work, you really help us to do a lot of things better, but I would like also to ask if your team can increase number of languages (for example until 10, at least) used in the part ""recent languages""? It could be very useful, especially for those who learn or work with wide range of languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The previous version I used that was better than that one. The new version is very bad. It is difficult to capture the word or sentence I need. And the display colour changing facilities are not available here.. please resolve this issue. .
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. I go to the international market, a lot. Things from there are written in Asian languages, or something else. It will tell me everything, on the package. I get a kick outta it, certain ways you point it, it'll say some goofy stuff. Great app!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It very difficult to use, it does not pop up when you copy a message, and there is little or no options on the dashboard or navigate. The previous version was better, I wished I never upgraded.. how do I download the previous version?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google translate is fun and helpful. It's like a multi language dictionary easily accessible. The voice feature is also very nice. But, exact and precise translation is not guaranteed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for years, but an update last week is bad. The text is now huge, with only a few words visible, and half the screen is input options - total waste of space"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's okay but I discovered it does not give the real local vernacular translation, I mean the lay man translation of the language intended so it's very conspicuous for a person on the other side to know you're using a google translator. Also a feature of screen grab image should be considered."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the translation is totally OPPOSITE of what I've typed! I started doing reverse translation before I send it now. Sometimes have to re type it 3 times. I've seen it translate to say very mean things. It's gotten me and my boyfriend in arguments over it. I had no idea. I can understand it getting a few things incorrect, but to completely change my words to something hateful? Something is terribly wrong"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Does not detect all the text that needs to be translated. Used to work before very well, but now its broken... Please fix it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the tap to translate feature, but i wish it could just stay as a notification. I hate the floating icon!! If you turn off the floating icon, the next time you use the notification to tap to translate, the icon is back! No!!!! It's just as annoying as facebook messenger's chat heads!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good app but please release an ocr feature. I would be really glad if you added an ocr feature in the update. Like a mouse on the screen to drag it over the screen and select the text to be translated.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you want me to describe this app in one line, then I'll say, ""It's one of the best translation apps I've ever seen."" Yeah I agree offline translation isn't that good. But dude… you libe in 2021. You get the deal right. TBH, if you looking gor offline translation app, this app isn't for you. This app could be better if we could get antonym words from it. But not having the feature of getting antonym words doesn't make it bad. Try it. You will not regret. ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Can please add a feature that can translate a single particular word and can you give a arrow or something so we can drag it to that particle word and the translation came out. Because many people don't need full translation they just need to know the meaning of a particular word while reading something. So please give this feature. Please consider it because It will improve the app at a great level so please consider it. Thank you
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your app was great and saving my life. But do you feel compelled to make the app harder with each update? First you removed the self appearing icon, each time we have to reopen the floating icon. In the last update, we have to make a new move to paste the copied text. You are extending the steps we will take in each update, I wonder if you have a really logical explanation. Normally it takes 4 star but I am angry with you after last update."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The translate is so bad because everytime I say a word to english it says something else. For example arabic to english. The translation is sooo bad And when I speak it cuts me half way through. Also It would let me see the full translation. Only shows me a sentence. So bad never using it ever again. If you update it again to improve
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Also...extend the recorder time out time on dite and app. Some languages are difficult to pronounce. App translations are sloppy compared to the web based translator.🤔 Also when reversing translations...the top section stays the same...this didn't happen before. I'm Translating Russian btw. Screen translation would be nice & night mode would be great to!!! 👌🌚 eat = есть ... but есть = there is??? wth🤔 The web based translator seems way better... couldn't you just match them up?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very useful, but I wish the things that I've translated were a bit organised. And I wish there was a better way to edit the words you want to translate. But the app is pretty good and effective, I recommend using and downloading it"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Translating works fine. But in my opinion the ""Tap to translate"" function does not work as it should. The floating icon should only pop up after copying a word or sentence and not show on screen all the time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was not a great experience after update. It stopped allowing me to use split screen option which i used to do frequently for reading English newspapers. Please allow the app to use split screen. Kindly fix this issue.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app until they made the Tap to Translate icon always on. Before, it only came in when you copied text, now the icon just stays on top making this function annoying and therefore useless as the only workaround is to completely turn it off."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and been used many years. But after updated the new version, it's need add more few step to switch into different languages, and no more pronunciations. Thus it's become inconvenient compared to previous version."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New UI is absolutely awful. Not to mention I can no longer draw kanji or other characters, so the app fails to offer some features it used to. This is a huge mistake on Google's part."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dice the las updated is completely annoying and useless. The floating tap button doesn't emerge automatically when u copy something. And u you change the setting to make it appear. It stay there plus the notification in the top ... Super annoying. Please fix this!!! Turn it back!!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I always love using it but by the latest update, i can't import image from my memories phone anymore. I have several times reinstall it, but it's still doesn't work, idk where the problem is, but i really hope you can do something with it.. and also i somehow like the older version"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is really awesome it helped me a lot I use it everyday in fact in every single minute. But sometimes it does not shows the right feedback need to improve in that and my request you is that if we write anything wrong it should be auto corrected with proper grammar.thanku
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very useful app for translating
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tab and translate changed! It's not good this way I hope 🙏 you give us options or make it like before. I saw it and still don't like it at least an option for us or something better when I tap translate it cover the whole page also slow and its not accurate like before something is wrong .
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Helpful app, but inconsistent across my apps and email. If I copy text, it would be nice to just be able to translate it directly from the copy/paste pop up bubble, instead of having to open the app up each time and paste."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Works good. Good for translating but sometimes the meaning of a word changes. For example if I translated an English word to Bengali and then translated it back from Bengali to English it shows a different meaning. Pls try to fix this. It becomes very awkward when people understand something else than what I mean.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Does not translate Mexican Spanish correctly. Some results are laughable. There should be a submenu with a choice of regions for Spanish. EDIT: I did look for the place to report feedback in the app, but there was no form or instrctions."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Some of the translations are a little goofy but correct most of the time. I know it's user based so it really helps when bilingual or more volunteer to help make the app a little more correct.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had Spanish downloaded and was working fine. The app did an upgrade and Spanish did not work anymore. It shows it is downloaded bit also shoes that I must download it. When I tap on download nothing happens. I ended up ordering the wrong food because the app wasn't working.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I found an issue with auto correct. I want to translate.. Juan, add Sarah the food. It's automatically converting ""add"" to ""and"" and then translating, which is completely wrong and that's not what i want..?? Why it's doing this... The old version didn't do that automatically and neither did the web version only on Android app it happens."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app but one thing that really irritates is when using my phone, if I try to alter some text, the size of the visible space for editing the text shrinks to a single line for each language at the top of the screen."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Translates the same as before but if you want a certain word or phrase instant translated you cannot do it as before in 1 step but multiple steps. To get it quicker you need to stay with the icon on your screen all time. Thst's annoying... Good job programmer...
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Translation from English to Hungarian has always been mediocre but the unique Tap to Translate pop up bubble compensated for that. With Android 10 loosing clipboard watching Tap to Translate became annoying: it is either always visible and in the way or remains hidden even when needed.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best translation app ever. There's nothing that this app could not do. Extracting text from pics is like 99.99% correct. There could be a random odd issue but I need to also correct the text too. I don't expect it to do all my work. Brilliant app. & thanks a million to all you google developers who have created a gem of a FREE app for some ungrateful users. Robin David Business Analyst

And because I had a problem with the English language, I was struggling in my studies. And when I wanted to translate English, I was entering every single word in other apps. But now that I got the google translate app, I was able to translate a lot of text by copying and paste at the same time. For this, I was able to give 5 stars and a review."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app in case of emergencies, but.. the sentences that it translate are not absolutely accurate . sometimes it gives a different meaning from what actually we have to say. May be it because of differences in languages."

When I finished copying words and tap the translator, it will not automatically translate it quickly like the old version, it will first demand me to paste the words the press next before choosing a language to translate.. That is totally a long process unlike the old version.. If you don't return back the old version, I will uninstall this app, because before I'll go through the long process to translate, 5mins has elapsed"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The translate image function was all I came for and it worked great. I was stuck in a JRPG bc I couldn't read the objective but this app helped with that. The translations aren't perfect but they are enough to understand and that's all that matters.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok nowadays. Good for the camera, but for more contextual translations with more information, use something else like Reverso. You'll be left scratching your head frequently otherwise. Also the voice translation seems to have trouble with Italian."

The problem isn't the notification, I didn't even have notification at all. The problem is that the bubble is shown constantly even when I have not copied any text."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The latest update has made removed so many Quality of Life touches that I can only assume it was pushed through as an elaborate troll. Automatically switching your keyboard to other languages if you had them installed, being able to see the translation as you were typing, and seeing foreign translations written phonetically. All great features that are suddenly absent in this newest version. How does Google consistently make everything they own worse?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app doesn't follow the keyboard language anymore. Before the update, whenever I translated from Russian my keyboard would change to Cyrillic format automatically, now I have to change manually. The same happens to English if I'm using a non latin alphabet keyboard. Please fix this, it's really annoying."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Working pretty good again, but I also have a pixel now. It still really needs to work on reading various fonts, some of the Korean and Chinese I translate comes with cute fonts, nothing too far out, and it just can't grasp it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a pretty good app it does the job my fiance is Dominican doesn't speak that much English but the app helps out a lot we have to repeat things sometimes but I find the slower you talk the better it translate. I want to see a 80 to 90% accuracy
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I hate the new conversation update. You took something that worked very well and updated it to this auto mode for both languages and it socks. Often gets conversations wrong and translations incorrect also.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hello. In the old version, when playing audio from the music player, Google Translate would start translating when you release the translate button, but in the new version, Google Translate stops converting audio to text by pressing the translate button.why???"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new ui update is a huge downgrade and really unecessary. I can no longer adjust the height of handwriting option and it doesn't show at all in split screen. Bring back the old version please it was much better than the new update.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,what the hell happened with the camera feature?????and who thought this was a good idea!the buttons don't work and the app keeps translating the picture even if you don't instruct it to.that means what ever is in front of my camera the camera tries to translate and then stores that somewhere in your system....what the hell is going on!!!!!!!I can be hovering with my phone above secret documents not wanting to translate them but the app will do it anyway because the camera tries to translate what
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you're not required to use this for your job or something else important, don't waste your time on it. It's garbage. The technology, especially camera translate, isn't there yet. Update: guess what I don't need translated, you overrated pile of trash? I don't need the person's name at the bottom of the quote. That much should be obvious. . . ."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app doesn't make any sense when you can use the web version which is faster, more convenient and doesn't have any ads. It takes much longer for the app to load and to make translations which is ridiculous, actually."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"of course it needs improvement, if it is perfect then there is no room for such, it is not easy to learn languages too and people who come here actually help in with the pronunciation. try and help out and be a translator for your language."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this translator. Very easy to use. Does job as intended with no problem. Microsoft/Google/deepl translators are definitely the best language translators out there. I actually have all three apps. Google translator is definitely highly recommended.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is OK, so I guess...but when you take a photo of a language, and they should add every language. This was a bitter disappointment lack of options I struggled to get the hang 9f things. Not very good in my opinion"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please restore the old version, the new version is very annoying and not user friendly! I dont get the pop up when i copy words am gonna have to open the translater from the top, And also ITS NOT COPIED!!! Its really an awful update please just restore the old update! Pleeeeeease!! I cant live without google translate but now its not helping me at all! And it takes more time than ever!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely don't like the latest update. Not comfortable at all. I can't see the latest words and phrases that I'd just translated. Please, make an option to return the old version. Otherwise will have to search for an alternative translator."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The new look of the application is catchy and pleasing to the eye however there is one part I didn’t like. please the developers of the new UI should consider placing the button in its correct position because they will look messy and confuse the user of such application. what I wanted the developers to fix in the new UI system was the location of the paste button which was very annoying and not in the right position.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a brilliant app.There is no translation app like this.Good going Google.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The fact that this application works very well without the Internet makes it even better. +The problem was that when translating what was given from another copy, it mixed up paragraphs and destroyed them. But I hope you will fix it. It was very useful for me"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recent interfaces changes are a step backwards for Traditional Chinese users. The app continually defaults back to Simplified Chinese, it's incredibly frustrating to use - I'm now looking for alternatives."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is good for translation , but have three problems, 1: It has no option to translate Sanskrit to Bengali or Bengali to Sanskrit in offline. Also in case of translation in these two languages, lens input is not available in online also . 2: It do not speak Odia language . 3:It do not translate Odia to Bengali and Bengali to Odia properly in lens input option. It will helpful for me, if you update this app with solving the problems. Thank you."

Suggestion: Allow for ""Replies"" to comments so experienced Users help you guys with tried and true troubleshooting tips. Like Heidi Swan's issue. You should have told her to ""uninstall the app and reinstall the app"". Yet you use a canned response to everyone having an issue. Do you think we're stupid?, and don't know it's a static ""canned"" reply!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has helped me communicate with new friends and learn languages (of course alongside other apps.) One issue though is i cant choose which definition of the word i am using, so even the definitions of the translated words are off. There should be control on both sides."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had annoying issues with this case: early I very often use feature ""tap to translate"" and copied text to translate. BUT now - the app icon shows on the screen permanently and not dissapear!!! It keeps bothering all time :( the app has been updated to the latest version on play market.(may 17, 2020)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I mostly use camera translate for a language not supported by Instant mode yet. So every time i open camera i need to switch into a scan mode manually. It's annoying, because in previous app version camera was in scan mode by default. Please add ability to set camera mode in app settings!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be my favourite translation app. Effortless translation with one click. Now, after the update, it is frustrating and useless. Multiple clicks to translate, blank translations, lame U.I, and all around just too glitchy now. Why mess with something that wasn't broken? I have to uninstall now. Sigh."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Quite useful app especially for developing countries that education is not cover all parts and for those who have shortage of teachers. But, you have to develop more especially on translation of whole paragraph and you have add other languages."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Camera translate does not work offline on some phones
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lousy... like most Google products in '22. Crashes often on Google's Pixel 6 (with new Tensor chip). ""Live Translation"" is non-functional. Mostly useless, except for translating individually-typed words. That can be done in any browser - no need for this beta-level app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am very disappointed because I have been using the app for a while now but since the last auto-update the camera function is not working anymore. I see absolutely no reason why it would SUDDENLY(!!!) need BODY SENSORS?! It worked perfectly fine before and it makes me sad that I can't use the feature anymore. Please change this back and I'm willing to give a better review cause I truly enjoyed the app before. If you won't I want to at least get explained why it would now need body sensors.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Waste of space and time shows only ads and takes forever to load the translation dont buy this garbage
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app sucks. When you talk to the app as a translator it does not tell you and say what you're saying. It says what it wants to say. Which means it's not efficient.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Jan 2022. Latest version is awful. Typical Google. Don't fix the dreadful translation but mess with the app and make it horrible to use. STOP CONSTANTLY CHANGING APPS! Not very good at conversation translation. most results are garbage. Keep your input phrases simple and it may work. All these stupid responses by Google don't help. Feedback is not responded to. Also if we knew the correct translation to report to google we wouldn't need the app in the first place.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sir thanks for this wonderful App, millions of students , housewives, senior citizens and common people of our India are getting proper translation and this app is helping our nation in Many ways.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I got an error trying to recognize my voice. If you translate using voice many times, after sometimes the language text input you are translating from got invisible. Closing and opening the app the problem gets solved, but we have to do this process every time it causes this problem."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Last upgrade screwed this app all up!! Import pics will only load landscape (sideways) and the 2nd or 3rd time I use the Import function, it freezes my whole phone up. Use this app a lot and until recently never had any issues.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was one of the best app but new update is pethatic and now this app is useless. Tap to translate does not auto translate copied text, nor save transfer language preferences as old version. Everytime you have to select language and paste text..UI is useless. Swap option is at north Poole to use while app is at south poole..Uninstalled."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It'll be more helpful if defections for a certain word can be displayed in offline translation. Also an option to enable both them and other-translations to be displayed in the ""tap to translate"" feature will be great. Otherwise, great service"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really feel uncomfortable seeing the new UI. The texts are super large and many settings have been moved or deleted. Please bring back the old UI or at least give us an option to use the old UI.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fabulous Experience with Google translate. Love it 😍♥️ But there is a problem. Offline languages take a lot of data. It will help a lot if it is reduced. The rest of the experience was very cool.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am a fan of Google apps..they are so useful. They make my life so easy everyday. I am a newly married girl who shifted to vizag after marriage. Have zero knowledge of Telugu...but i needed a maid urgently and she only speaks Telugu.. doesn't understand hindi aur English. I thought a lot how to solve this problem and tried this app. My god, it made everything easy...even my maid loved it. The conversation option is very smooth. Thanks google...you are the best."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A wonderful tool, in particular for technical articles originally in German or Japanese, but it does not integrate well with all apps. I cannot blame the app developers for avoiding the Google API sets. I would as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So there's a Send Feedback in Translation History, but not Clear History? Different UI now, but still clunky. Jumping around between screens, having to push buttons unnecessarily. Why can't it be simple like the website?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's just awful. After Las update the app doesn't work on data usage, WiFi only. And the new look of the screen is very bad.

I download all languages, restart the phone/app, clear cache, uninstall/install, restore factory setting, do cartwheels with strap jacket on. Nothing works. Go to goo.gle/2tkDc6j for expert help. Same complaints. No solution. Google LLC, have mercy and inform dev team, your higher ups, Larry Page, anybody who can fix this issue. I don't have a great command of English. You may misinterpret what I'm saying. That's why I need this fix."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice app. Could expand the number of recent languages used from 5 to 10 or let user decide within reason. Also, like have a saved history of about 20 phrases and statements but I can't order them as I would like. Add that functionality. Also no Haitian Creole speech audibly"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is good but from my experience , I could install about 4 languages but the only problem I have faced is the inability to install Japanese or any other language as it always shows errors , so I can't download Japanese or any other language and install it for offline translation , even though I have sufficient memory for installation , I had 4 languages installed : Arabic , French , English and Portuguese. if it weren't for this problem I would have rated you 5 stars"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New Google update sucks , floating icon gets in the way , can't just tap the message in messenger or what's app , and copy and translate , without the tap icon on , going to have to find a new translate app , your reply is not satisfactory , you need an option to remove the floating icon , without also losing the ability to still translate"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The camera translate modes don't work I can't get them to translate the back of a medicine box that is clearly in Korean but it will only translate two things out of the entire back and I need to be able to read the back of this so I can take the medicine properly but I can't because it won't work. Tried multiple times.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing how apart from translation, it also transliterates a language to English letters. I speak a few languages but don't know how to read them. Transliterated text in this app helps me read it in English letters & understand it far far better than the attempted translation which is not always 100% accurate. Fantastic job in making English letter transliteration."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think overall this app is good. But there are some features the developers can add. This app doesn’t determine any error(grammatical eror,wrong sentence making etc) when a person speak up,but it gives accurate meaning although the sentence isn’t accurate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tap to Translate floating icon now stays permanently on screen, instead of only coming up when text is copied to the clipboard. It still pops up even after being dismissed. The notification is also permanently displayed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know how but Google managed to ruin this app. Voice to text is ATROCIOIS. It doesn't pick up half the text I say, microphone shuts off while I'm speaking, and it is absolutely doesn't transcribe words accurately for languages I am fluent in/pronouncing the words correctly."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why would you change this app to look like some kid version of a tablet. The app the way it was before was perfect. There was no reason to change it to something different. How could you make something so perfect and then turn it into complete trash.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I thought this was, and it still is cool, but only giving it 3 stars until I figure out the bug. In the conversation mode when I hit ""auto"" it translates from english to spanish just fine and speaks. But if I speak spanish it only translates and speaks the spanish back, not english. So, i tested it in reverse and it still read and spoke in spanish when I said a spanish phrase. How do you fix this? Galaxy s10 5g"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Tap to translate big problem indeed"" Can the floating icon disappear and show automatically when i copy something...?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Kinda ruined the usability of the app in the last years updates. It no longer auto pastes when clicking the notification to bring up the translate window, as it used to. Now it Only auto translates if you specifically click the floating icon, which i hate having floating icons everywhere."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google translate, indeed a fine and effective platform for translation of languages. Its accuracy though can be rightly criticised and much improvement can be made on this very useful and effective application. Google, a multi-billion dollar, international corporation can indeed further improve the translation process that this application provides."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Many years have passed and this translator still awful. It helps, yeah, but very poorly. The vocabulary, the app usability, the visuals. All bad. I thought Google knew everything."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update the app won't translate anything that I type into it. It's stuck on the loading screen without any end, that makes me just go to the browser and type it in there. First world problems? Yes, definitely. But then don't have the app right?!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This has made life very easy when working with people who speak no English and I do not speak their language. Whilst translation isn't always perfect, it is always good enough to enable conversation and to help make complex points understood. Hugely impressed with capability and speed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but not any more! The tap to translate is ruined! The permanent bubble is unacceptable. Used to be such a great feature when it popped up after copying text, but now it's totally ruined. Who wants that bubble up permanently??"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't everyone already know GTranslate? It does what it should do and quite well at that actually. And since it comes pre-installed on most devices, who needs anything else? I just wish they'd add all the languages that they support in the Google account settings (like Pirate, Klingon, as well as what looks like many real spoken dialects and languages) and vice versa (like Amharic/Tigrinya, Zulu, Swahili)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did you change the floating translation? 😡Earlier when the button just appeared once text was copied was soooo much better. No, your explanation does not help. The permanent floating icon is irritating, since one doesn't always need it. But when I copy something I want it to pop up as it used to do."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm sorry to say this but the newest update of google translate app sucks.I've been using google translate for more than 2 years.It was very very helpful, easy to use and fast.The new UI is not user friendly like the previous one.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Having the camera broken, I can't check pictures or screenshots from the gallery because it needs camera acces before. It would be really nice if you would separate them for the translate from picture function"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It gives almost correct meanings of words when online. Offline files are completely miserable. They tend to give wrong or improper meanings and sometimes no meaning at all. And donwloading offline files are often stuck.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to be able to correct bad translations. Now no longer. All the good features of the app have been whittled away .. corrections; you now have to go to the main app to swap languages; similarly to edit.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Best translate app very useful feature but Voice recognizing accuracy is average and the main problem is even I downloaded the language pack for ofline translating why I can't use speak translating feature why I can't use microphone even ofline Is the network required to turn on the microphone come on Google and please mention the language downloading size as play store
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest update is less user friendly. I have to do several taps now to switch languages back and forth. More clicks to go back to the camera translate as well. Google chose style over substance.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I prefer the old UI. Easier to navigate translation history and the text translated from image will directly put into the history. I can't even get to my history now.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, that's really good. It give results is short period of time as compared to other apps...

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Having to uninstall this app. Since system update there is a shortcut on the edge of the screen that will not go away and is constantly blocking other shortcuts no matter where I move it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,App is great but what happened to the floating icon? Now it sticks on the home screen and doesn't disappear? Before it used to show after copying text and i could dismiss it .. now it's like chewing gum in hair !
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Despite the updated UI-itus that seems to plague every application that updates their UI, the application is fully functional with a few bugs. People just don't like change, I suspect. Though, some people point to less features, but don't state the removed features."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app. I didn't know that it wasn't in my library of search apps, because without it's translation ability it would take much longer or possibly not getting documents translated at all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the new design is awful. the navigation is absolutely horrible and most of the time I have no idea where to click and the fonts are unnecessary big. what was the reason for that drastic change?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a cool app for translation but mostly every word that it translates are kinda wrong and sometimes it can't even translate some words.... And when it shows our previous translation, my phone hangs ... So hope you can fix these problems.... Thanks, Suma sini 😊"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was great but now the app keeps minimising itself before you can even type anything. It's just stuck in text input mode and impossible to get to things like saved phrases.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Lots of fun and useful. Have used it traveling in Europe to read menus and occasionally communicate. Tried translating Japanese writing and it was passable. At least I could understand the pamphlet.

So now i am uninstaling. i hope google finds the solution ASAP..."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The Bengali translation of this application is horrible. Many times it gives irrational and even opposite translation. And there are differences between the usages of Indian and Bangladeshi Bengali. Bangladeshi influence is prevalent in this app. Phone's location should be used to produce the exact synonyms for different usages. I have corrected many such erroneous translations but it is still producing same wrong translations. Never trust this app blindly!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So so so helpful for travel. I love that I can read menus, signs and even talk to the locals. I will even hand them my phone to talk into it and have had awesome experiences with people I would normally not be able to communicate with. So amazing"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The number of clicks needed to translate increased a lot which makes it frustrating. Fix it like it was before this new update. Bring back the swap button back and the auto paste. Ps:/ please help me downgrade the APK. to the previous version
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new version is truly terrible. Please do do not change the interface for the sake of just renewing. Every change must have its purpose. Please revert to the old interface
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Does improvement means make the application worst? The copy and translate is gone. Now the icon is always on and you need to copy/click-app/paste/translate or copy never shows and copy/find-app/open/paste/translate. Please roll back the changes.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Using across 8 languages. Not yet smooth in translation. However, the most painful part is, doesn't work well with Google Indic keyboard. Often 'halant' is substituted with a (second) period."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why did it automatically opens Google Lens when I try to translate a picture? It's horrible. Bring back the previous one where it scans the pic and let's you choose the sentences you want to translate instead of translating the whole thing it makes no sense anyway.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Some functions require streaming high speed internet, which is not always available in developing countries. Assumes wrong language often. Scanning options need much more work."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy Best convenient app to use. Whenever we need to translate to any language we need to download that language script and after that very easy to use. Has voice recognization and can translate from any photo as well very good app.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app for translating real life conversations. If you pause for even a second itll stop translating and start the TTS then you have to completely restart what you were saying. Its incredibly frustrating.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst update of camera-translate ever. It's ok if you want to include this lens-trash that much. But at least let users choose and customize. What's so difficult to add one switch and let people use old convenient camera?

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The application works well but it's limited to little things. It can be improved with real time translations like translating real-time while working on other apps. Also translating while making calls. Then I use Weibo. I can't translate it easily.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disastrous removal of functionality. First you removed the history behind a sign up process that was flawed meaning years of carefully curated snippets lost. Then you removed visual translate instead sticking a primitive Google Lens window. Google Lens is NOT primarily a translator..If people wanted to use Google Lens then they have that choice..but they downloaded TRANSLATOR because , guess what we want to TRANSLATE and NOT do pointless internet image searches. I am not alone!!"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Tap to translate"" always displayed on screen. In older Android versions, he appeared only when I copied text and it was very convenient. But now she is constantly on the screen and it really hinders."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's says offline, but the app is not allowing me to download offline, and why download the app when I can just use wi-fi or data on Google search. The app was supposed to help offline. I believe that apps that lie about their effectiveness should not even be used."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great app! Love that I can easily translate any language & hear it! The really cool feature is to hold the camera over text & it will translate late it! Just wish there was a way to use it while using IG. I love that I can answer someone back in their own language.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,ya good experience absolutely awesome . This is good app for translating easily in any language except for sanskrit . I suggest developers to implement how to use the searched word in a sentence and how the word's meaning changes in some grammatical cases. I also wanted to suggest that developers can work on sanskrit language because of demand of sanskrit in foreign and india . And also developers can add new reading themes so that children can easily study the words in the night at examtimes.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The February 2022 update is horrible. 75% of the features were dismissed. Unsatisfactory. This taught me to deselect ""automatic updates"" from my apps. 》 Now I am forced to locate a better translator app."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's the point of downloading languages if it's only going to let you down when you need it by saying ""unavailable offline""? Dreadful. Edit: Will any of the workers answer this? Every time I need an offline translation (I work regularly in remote areas of Peru) this app lets me down. I have the languages downloaded, but it just says that it can't do it offline. Edit 2: ""reconnect to WiFi/Data and download languages again"" is such totally useless advice in this situation as to be laughable."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give it 5 star cuz it helps me quite a lot but I've been having a problems with the translator. Whenever I translate something to Korean the translator translates it to a totally different thing. The translator is so weird when it translates something to Korean. But this only happens when I translate something to Korean. The translator is totally fine when I translate something to Japanese.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible Update, please change back to the old functionality. Before the clipboard text was directly translated, now need to paste it in manually. Why in God's name Google makes such backsteps in functionality every time? It's not the first time that an update went totally wrong, why you guys don't roll out a beta and do a functionality check before totally ruin the app?"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know who thought it was a good idea to completely change a wonderful translator for the worst. Also the redundant responses, to comments, from Google LLC are ridiculous. People who use this translator are pointing out constructive criticism about the bad redesign and nobody, who redesigned this even cares. Everyone is saying to put it back, to what it was but you'll aren't listening."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have one question, is there any limitations for the number of words could be save in the phrase book?. Why I asked this question? Because I had some words I am sure I kept before their, starred, but occasionally when I theck it again by writing it down in translation requests it appears unmarked. Second question, why the word if starting with capital letters and the same word written by the small letters it appears without star. If both same word mast be stored as one word to avoid overcrowded"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty much is what it says. Does what it should do. Clear design. Maybe a little wierd that I usually don't open the translation page, but use the preview window. Maybe change it so the preview window is a little more detailed? Like it overall"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the new update! Before was more practical! If you were writing something in another language it was suggesting to translate in that language instead of the pre-set one! Now you have to got to both of the sections to change the Languages because otherwise, of course, it won't translate, loke if you are of line!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very slow and camera mode doesn't translate very accurate in some languages
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everytime I open the translate it shows a notification that i should backup my history to my account. This seems to be bug. It was supposed to remember my choice but seems like it prompts me that backup message every time i open it.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very worst update ever. The old version which don't use Google lens are better than this news update. The translate are very confused and not right. The old version are more persistent and it's accuracy are very perfect than this one.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Outstanding app; I have used this app extensively and it's exceeded my expectations. It's one of my favorite apps. A keeper if you really want top communicate with others who don't speak your language. Shared understanding is powerful.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What a trashy updated, bite the whole page and need to scroll down to see the rest of translation , time consuming in figuring out and looking around to get the job done. Just leave it the classic way."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, unfortunately it does not work as well as it used to. If you take a picture of text it hussles the sentences making the translation useless. Hope this gets fixed."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Useful! Has great potential to be a part of daily life! Please find a way to integrate this into phones in a clean intuitive way. English /Spanish. slang and humor are very important.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The only word it seemedto translate from French to English was ""avec"" . everything else just kept jumping around the screen and changing font size. Quite a useless application. I have uninstalled it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The translation is not that bad except the app mostly doesn't allow me to copy the translated text after voice translation. Upon touching the text box, it automatically erase the old text & activates the recorder for new translation."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App assumes there is no internet when connected to the internet using wifi and uses inaccurate offline translation. However, when I am using mobile data it works properly. Google Translate used to work before with wifi but now it no longer does."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Many times translation is wrong or incomplete. If you don't have right translation just say 'we don't have translation of this sentence'. Sometimes it translates any other language word in English ,not the word's meaning in English ,same word just written in English"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The camera gives a different translation for each angle which makes it very inaccurate.Sometimes it gives English words that dont exist. Work on these features when creating an updated version😩I feel you can do better than this
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Older version was very good. this version is totally bogus and unsatisfactory. It does not translate properly and also voice typing is full of faults and errors. I request for the previous version that would mostly satisfy the subscribers.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new version is worse than the older one. You cannot swap languages and it does not automatically suggest a language for the translation. Please bring back all the functionalities of the old version.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Newest version is better than older but some features have been removed. Would you please add ""copy text to translate"" feature. That means whenever I copy any text from somewhere then a floating translate icon should be opened to translate instantly"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"totally misdeveloped app, many features are just opposite ,like delete history should be swiped right to left and history menu should be open from downside to upside. earlier google apps were ease of access now totally confusing,every app has same issue."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Obviously the translation is good and the camera OCR is good but the app keeps asking me whether i would like to use my account to save translation history on startup. Every time. The history is already there when I check. Please fix this issue.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to be useful when Chinese to English showed pinyin along with the English translation but now it doesn't anymore. Also the translation is often intelligible so I badly need the pinyin too! Pls put it back Google
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every thing is good unless I speak. This translator doesn't hear the last word, that makes me say it 2 times. And this is so annoying especially when you are a student and need to translate so much. If you fix it I will change it to 5 stars"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you bring back the old floating icon, which wasn't permament, or at least add this functionality? It was really convinient. The elimination of this feature forced me lower my opinion for 2 stars"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think I kinda prefer the previous version to this one, while using a new language for the first time, it detects the language,but the current version doesn't.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a very good app, I think this app should come pre loaded with Android as this app according to me is very useful.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great app. Always helpful. Googleteam really impressed me. Bit the problem is, it translates word to word not according to the meaning of sentence. It changes the meaning completely. Otherwise overall good. And please try to add Sanskrit."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am very happy with the app and I want the Google to develop the app in a way that it takes no data in the app so that it will be more useful but anyways i am shocked that this much better translation is happening according to the language preference and i am very happy with this kind of awesome app. Just this suggestion only or else also it is fine as Google consumes less data. I am very happy with this app. Hats off to the company Google.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Previous version better. As it allows us to select words to be translated and able to compare the translation side by side. Currently it just overlap the existing words.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,PC web browser version of Google Translate is much much superior than Mobile version of it. Most of features are lacking in this. I want to correct translation like PC web browser version but its not available. How such advance feature is not included in mobile version.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I do not understand why on earth you don't include a field where one can type or paste a website address and then navigate a website written in a language one cannot understand --> getting its content translated in real time in one's own native language. I know Google can already do that, since long, on the plain internet through one of Google's websites, so why doesn't Google enable us to do it through this app as well? Tell me why, 🤔I just don't get it."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Amazingly bad camera translation. I think it is better not to include it. This cant even be an alpha version. To add, I was translation Spanish and Russian, not a language that doesn't have a large speaking population."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I know multiple languages and from first hand I can assure you that your translations are mostly inaccurate.. Translating a single word should not be that difficult, people expect you to translate sentences but you have trouble translating words.. Another CR-APPLICATION from google!!

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think there are a lot of shortcomings in this app which the Google team should work to improve. As the accuracy of camera translation, scan translation and voice and type translation is not correct ."

Seriously though, my sister-in-law is Bulgarian and when her none English speaking mother visited, I downloaded Bulgarian. When my husband got me a MP3 in Japanese by accident, I downloaded Japanese. I have numerous Spanish speaking customers at the convenience store where I work, so I downloaded Spanish. The only limits I've found is the space on my phone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You can write continuous lines like paragraph but can not write in next line. This app will not let you enter in the next line. The input text box does not increase vertically. So long sentence/paragraph cannot be seen on the screen. You will have to scroll. Not having good experience using this app.

I don't know why they don't pay a Hispanic Mexican, a Porturican, a Honduran etc..... to allow thier languages to be recorded for improvement. They all are completely different then Spain Spanish. I am glad you all created the Mexican Spanish. However, there is ALOT of slang and it changes from regions. So, yes you'll probably should go with someone from each State within each country.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,the reason I give it a two is because it translates a couple of words and that's it you can have like a sentence or write a letter. it makes it difficult when you're having a conversation with somebody have to cut the conversation short which I think can use Improvement
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to the app? Whoever designed, developed, and approved the changes and launch needs to be fired asap. You ruined a perfectly good app. Extra steps for translation, it won't even read Spanish back to me. Are you taking a piss or are you joking? Have a serious talk with the team and fix this mess of an update... 💩"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What about the old version which is deserving for five star.... This is poor app you developed. The old app was quiet good and shows everything what we tried to translate since opened. You destroyed such a wonderful app in the name of update.... Old one showed the list of words we tried to translate. This is nonsense
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,with the recent update you lost a star. the app is not intuitive or user friendly now. reverse translation is not easy. it is more visually appealing but what good is that when you're trying to talk to someone else?
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps switching to Simplified Chinese though I always use Traditional Chinese. Research into this issue suggests it's been an issue for several years with no fix. Switching to Microsoft's Translator.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The translator has special errors in writing dates. It must be compatible with the British language
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"if I could give negative stars, I would, I still wonder what happened to them, they were the best translation app until today today's update completely changed the app, in the bubble it doesn't recognize the second language, I configured it and nothing continues anyway, he regretted too much what they did with an app that was really good, easy to use and very practical today they are nothing like that and he will be surprised, but it is not the same anymore and it sucks😔"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I noticed something really impractical. Lets say I pasting few sentences in the translation field and I want to edit it. Then editing section shrinks at the top leaving one third of screen blank what makes editing really difficult.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,no more offline translation support? your support team send me this - ( Open app - Menu - Offline Translation. Ensure both the languages are listed under “Downloaded Languages”. Try enabling “Airplane Mode” from phone Settings to be completely offline. Hope that helps. ) I am unable to find this option please guide me !
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update works as bad as xhit. The previous version was way better than this new version, I would find previous version of the app and install it instead of this version. I can't draw kanjis with this version anymore and the interface is very bad compared with the previous version"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App gets stuck trying to open it the first time so I've stopped trying and switched to a different translator entirely. It's not worth the wait or multiple attempts force-stopping the app every single time.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I would give it five stars except it has no phonetic pronunciation for Russian. So while I can hear the word being spoken the letters look so odd I would like to be able to see the real Russian letters and a phonetic spelling underneath it so I can feel and see and understand what I'm saying and not just try to emulate a sound with no actual phonetic knowledge of what I'm trying to say. I want the phonetic pronunciation AND the Russian lettering. I would like to see both so I can learn!
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The area where one types the words is extremely small. Correct it so one is able to see a big part of the sentence when one types something instead of a small sliver because it's difficult to edit stuff.

I have made my research before writing a feedback, I know why it's changed and I don't care about why you did that. Give people a choice, I can protect my data if needed, you can't just take that function away! That's not the way to tackle a problem. There's at least hundreds of ways to solve the problem but no you must make it impossible to use! Unless you don't speak or use another language you don't know the pain in it!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The new update is awesome...just one fault that I have found is to choose speaking option one has to wipe away keyboard and then select. This reprehensible feature caused to me resentment . Try to fix it asap

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last update is very bad. Please remove Google Lens from image translation. I used to be able to take several photos very quickly and translate them, but now because of Google Lens, I can't anymore and the program is very slow."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The application has become more than poor in the last update. When you translate papers or something you want to translate, you translate everyone, but it does not specify the translation you want. You can try the translation on the camera and you will see. Honestly, it's getting worse and worse and doesn't deserve no star"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app,I'm using it exclusively since years. But since the last update the bubble is stick and if you disable the pop-up option you won't be able to translate after copying text"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After some update this app requires Google App to translate the images which makes it useless. To clarify: it is very-very bad design decision to make a mobile app dependent on another (otherwise useless bloatware) app. Needless to say, that Google Lens is also a piece of ugliness, so the old good image search now is also broken."

If i can put a -5 in my rate i would but i can't, you just made this app the worst while it was the best app one so far, why?"

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's something wrong with this app. When I try to translate an image it tells me to sign in. When I try to sign in, it automatically enters an email for me but I don't use that email anymore, so I try to change the email. When I try to change the email it doesn't let me. When I click on the box my keyboard does not appear and thus I can't change the email! Please fix this!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like Google translate very much. But after last updates I found one issue: when Tap to translate is enabled, icon is active always. It is annoying, why it is not hiding as before? It was more comfortable."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for the past 10 years, but lately it's been a GODSEND! We host teens from multiple countries and converse with their parents, most not understanding English. Recently, one of these families came for a visit and I spent a 6-hour car ride getting to know them, laughing and developing true friendships! While they stayed in our home, Translate in Conversation mode made what could've been awkward silence into laughter and tears. And in Transcribe, church was accessible!"

Truth is about everything Google that came on my phone I've had to disable or restrict (couldn't uninstall it or I would) and download something different. The translation app and Chrome were the only ones left. Now Chrome is alone.

"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Sometimes the translation isn't all that accurate but it's still a good app. I know it's quite hard to get people that speak all those languages so it must be hard.

I'm never asked to install it or purchase it. So I'm pretty disappointed and pretty upset. I don't want to purchase this and I don't want to install it.

What if I only have the picture in my gallery? Edit: Why make the user go through extra steps though? I want to screenshot, share and choose the translator for quick translations. Not have to open the translator app after having taken a screenshot, find said screenshot, and then open it up to be translated. SCREENSHOT> SHARE>TRANSLATE - that's way more intuitive."

"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be the best app on my phone. Now after the update camera stopped working unless I install Google Lens. How about giving users the ability to revert back to a version WITHOUT need of Installing additional software? Worse case I suggest everyone to forcefully downgrade to an alder APK version and block the autoupdate feature.

So by the time I read properly it takes a lot of time and I don't understand a lot.. I take my text book pics and this app reads it aloud for me ... What else do I need as a student? Beautiful creation.. thank you Google you made my day
"May 12, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Giving two star because there is no Pashto to English translation in voice version. And wished to help them with some of my knowledge bit there are only questions to answers of that in correct and incorrect. It will be better to the people a chance to type their own language and translate in English to make it more better. But....
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap-to-translate icon doesn't work as a pop-up icon anymore in android 10 with the latest version of the app. It is very inconvenient to use the phone with the translate icon always on the screen.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest Update made App wortless. I used to be able to take a photo, them with Finger select what should be translated. The next I could then also copy. Today 90% of written words are found which makes most sentences incomplete.."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i can't use translator in offline mode because can not download any language file. most of them are only 40-45mgb in size, i have 29GB free space but each time i get message to free up the space for downloading! all other functions work great but i need it in offline also. asking google to do a favor in solving this!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Translations are letters and characters in random order. The app does not provide readable translations. I deleted it and downloaded it a second time. It still wouldn't work.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Before the latest update, Keyboard language was changing automatically when the writing language changed (if the GBord is being used). Now it takes longer to type special letters. Maybe one of the most useful tools for a new language learner is gone."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tap To Translate floating icon is not good since last some updates. It's was good before. But now it's not opening automatically when we copy a sentence Now we have open that when we want to translate then we have to copy the sentence that is not good We need old option that is good
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can no longer use the camera features since a update, app tells me to update the Google app, but I can't update that because the play store tells me, the app isn't compatible with my phone and I have to use Google go. Updating Google Go does nothing obviously."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very nice app. Only issue is it's not working properly on other apps, Example if we enable translation on other apps while we copy any word in pdf, and pressing on translater icon it showing nothing. Please fix this issue"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new version looks good but not convenient to use, especially tap to translate. It is difficult now every time I need to tap and change language to translate."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The most effective translating app I have come across so far. so simple to use, friendly appearance, instant transactions with numerous worldwide languages. Also works offline - perfectly for on the go."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for certain languages. I was so happy when Yorùbá was added as a language, but the more I try to use it the more I realize that Google translate does not actually know Yorùbá. It's absolutely useless with regard to the Yorùbá language. Please learn Yorùbá and improve this function. Also, Google recognizes Hindu but does not translate it into English at all."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app. I would give it 5 stars, but all the languages do not have speech output or the written translation. Like Persian has only their language not the American translation or speech output. This way we could learn the language better."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Does a really nice job with Mandarin. Would be great to include Cantonese.
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Need to be improved in translating into/from languages having different structure in grammar - for instance, Korean. But for the rest, it's just amazing! Must-have app! :)"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Improve the translator app to display ""Sinhala"" characters when typing in ""Singlish"". It is already works that way on the Google Translate website. It is very useful. Therefore, improve the Google translator app as well."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No offline translate anymore, even with the translate on (for instant translation with other app) is not working!! I can't even see ""downloaded languages"", all ""available languages"" in the settings! And it tells me ""you are offline"" as well as a message ""this language is not available offline"" no matter what language I tried!! I don't want to uninstall and install again as this will makes me lose my translated date that I need and there is no way to save it before and retrieve it later!!!"
"May 12, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"unnecessarily complicated. the old one can show me all of the stuff i needed quickly. now, u click something, new window pop up. history is there somewhere but you have to search for it. wasting time."
"May 12, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use. Very helpful when you live in a foreign country and don't know the language!! 😉
"May 12, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I do love this app. It's great. but when translating from English to Spanish it's mainly non-feminine words. I talk to mostly females all day. They tend to look at me funny when I say something I learned but they correct me because they know I'm not fluent. Is it possible to put an option in for when you are talking to a female and a male?
