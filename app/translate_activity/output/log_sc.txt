['User attempts to copy a translation but has to first hide the keyboard to access the copy function.', 'User frequently copies and pastes translations while conversing with friends in another language, but finds it tedious due to the need to repeatedly hide the keyboard to access the copy function.']The app was superb until the recent update where they completely changed the UI, which now sucks. The most inconvenient part? I've to tap in the typing space to be able to see a small little history symbol on the top left. And what happens when I click on it? They have categorised my history into languages, like wow. And I don't need the typing space to cover my whole screen. Who's the product/UX guy who thought this kind of revamp was a good idea? Keep these in beta and AB tests, not the main v
['Tapping on the typing space to see the history symbol on the top left.', 'Clicking on the history symbol to find the history categorized by languages.', 'Dealing with the typing space covering the whole screen.']I loved this app. Whenever I copied a text, tap to translate would pop up, and I could easily translate. However recently that feature hasn't been working. Tap to translate bubble is always on my screen and won't go away. And when I hide it, I can't use that feature.

The only problem why i give 4 stars is the font. When i change my font and i screenshot a text its not accurate when becomes to scanning text in my screenshots. So please make an option that we can use our own and default font in the app itself for better and accurate scanning text from phone.

Very unintuitive, lots of frustrations. So many obvious improvements, so many obvious flaws. Clearly the developers don't use the app, or else they themselves would know its shortcomings and fix them. Simple things, like taking a picture but forgetting to switch what order the translation is in, having to back out and switch it and takr another picture. This could be automated, as this is an app by Google I don't see how it couldn't be, in the very least be able to flip post photo, with a button

This used to be a really good app, as previous translations could easily be found and seen. Now it seems it has been updated, and All history has disappeared, and recent translations that might be needed again quickly have to be re_input,which is very inconvenient. I am sure things can be saved but there is no menu and no obvious way to do so.not happy

This app was perfect and has been converted to nightmare. Was there no user testing? . Biggest problem is it doesn't always does pinyin if Chinese to English or if using thesaurus (I don't know all the Chinese symbols). Back button doesn't take you to last selection now, it resets the input , so frustrating

What have you DONE and why?? I used this app frequently now I miss some of the features even before a history was listed down now you have to stop writing and hit a button that brings you to another window. To many clicks for a simple translation, history was all listed in one screen during writing. Not my favourite anymore!
