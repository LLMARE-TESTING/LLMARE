You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**Output:** NO

**Reason:**
1. **Reproducibility:** The scenario describes a specific issue (centering text) likely related to a specific widget or feature within the app. This indicates a fixed interface problem which makes it reproducible.
2. **Helpful in Improving App:** The issue mentioned is about the functionality of centering text, which directly impacts the app's usability and user experience, meeting this criterion.
3. **Cross-Application Issue:** The user's comment does not specify whether this problem occurs only in this particular app or across multiple apps. The description is not explicitly tied to a single app, which fails to confirm that it’s not a cross-application issue.

Because the third point is not explicitly addressed, the output is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Unable to trim music within the app and needing to go to Google to trim music.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**Output**: YES

**Reason**:
1. **Reproducible Scenario**: The scenario describes a specific feature within the app (music trimming) and the user's inability to perform this function within the app itself. This is a fixed aspect of the app that can be checked by navigating to the music trimming feature. The user’s complaint is about the absence of this feature rather than a randomly occurring issue.

2. **Feature Improvement**: Trimming music directly within the app is a functional feature that can significantly enhance user experience and convenience. This is a usability issue rather than a content-related problem.

3. **Cross-Application Issue**: The scenario does not involve cross-application functionality. The issue arises within the context of using the app normally and not in a background or floating window state. The problem specified is about needing to leave the app to perform a task that users expect to be able to perform within the app.

Given that all three criteria are met, the output is **YES**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Cut the clip in half while editing and observe that the background music is also cut, causing a gap in the middle of the edit.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario meets some but not all of the required points.  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario is likely reproducible as it describes a specific feature (clip editing) within a specific application (presumably a video editing app). The issue occurs during a typical editing task, which is a fixed interface feature and not a randomly appearing one.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue described relates to functionality (background music being cut) rather than content-related issues, indicating that fixing this problem could enhance user experience and improve application functions.

3. **Cross-application**: The scenario seems to be app-specific and likely does not involve cross-application processes. 

However, the mentioned conditions about app states (small window, background, etc.) are not clearly addressed. Therefore, we cannot definitively state this scenario only occurs under "normally started" conditions without additional context, preventing a clear fulfillment of all points.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario describes a specific issue related to the "cut" feature and background music handling during the editing and saving process within the app, indicating it is a fixed interface and feature of the app and not random. There is no mention of needing new features, implying these functionalities are currently part of the app.  
2. The issue addresses the functionality related to playing and saving edited videos, which is crucial for improving the app's usability and enhancing the user experience. It is not related to content issues like ads or content accuracy.  
3. The scenario is contained within the app's functionality and does not imply cross-application issues or occur under minimized or background conditions. It happens during the normal operation of the app after editing and saving a video.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not meet the third point. It mentions that the "auto velocity feature doesn't function properly," which is not necessarily limited to a specific application or app interface. Without further specific details about the application (e.g., name, version, environment), it cannot be determined that it is not a cross-application issue. Additionally, the description suggests a possibly inconsistent behavior ("causing a glitch on a frame"), which may not be reproducible consistently across all devices and app states.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Using sounds found on TikTok within the app due to the integration with TikTok.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario mentions using sounds found on TikTok within the app due to integration. It does not describe a specific application page or widget/feature that is consistently available and not randomly appearing, nor does it confirm that the feature currently exists, suggesting it could be a feature requested by the user.  
2. The feature described relates to app functionality and user experience enhancement but it's not specified if this functionality is currently part of the app.  
3. The scenario seems to involve cross-application interaction between the app in question and TikTok, meaning it might depend on external factors and processes not confined to the standalone app.  

Thus, not all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves sounds "moving away" when tapped while making a video, which seems to imply either an unusual or non-existent feature or a misunderstanding of how the app is intended to work. The description does not specify a fixed interface or a specific feature that is consistently reproducible across different uses of the app. Furthermore, the feature described seems vague and may not be a common, intended functionality of a video-making app. Hence, it does not fully meet the first point of being a fixed, specific scenario that can be reproduced consistently.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

   - This describes a specific feature and functionality within the "CapCut" app—the sound editing or importing feature.
   - It does not appear to suggest a feature that does not currently exist, but rather an issue with an existing function.

2. **Improving Application Functions and User Experience:**
   - The scenario is about a technical problem (glitches and pauses) that affects a core function of the app (importing and handling sound files multiple times).
   - Addressing such issues would directly improve the performance and usability of the application's sound editing capabilities, thus enhancing user experience.

3. **Cross-application Constraint:**
   - The scenario specifically related to CapCut and does not involve interactions with other apps, except for the initial condition where the sound is first played on the phone. However, the problem specifically arises within the CapCut app after sound import.
   - It is understood that the issue surfaces after CapCut is started normally and is not related to the app running in a small window or background.

Based on the analysis, all three points are met in this scenario. 

Output:

YES

Reason: The scenario describes an issue with an existing feature of CapCut (importing sounds multiple times) that is reproducible, relates directly to app functionality (not a content or ad-related issue), and the problem occurs within the CapCut app in a normal usage state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario "Experience problems with the effects in the app" is quite vague and does not describe a specific application page or feature. Without further details, it is not clear whether this issue is reproducible or tied to a specific interface of the application. For a scenario to be considered reproducible under your criteria, it needs to pinpoint a particular part of the application consistently, which this comment does not provide.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "The app crashes when trying to apply changes" does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature. It is a vague scenario without context about where or what kind of changes are being applied, making it difficult to determine if it's a fixed interface scenario. Additionally, while the issue is potentially related to app functionality and user experience, the lack of specificity means it is not guaranteed to be non-random or reproducible across all instances without further details.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario of the app crashing and restarting from the beginning does not describe a specific application page or a specific feature/widget, which makes it challenging to reproduce consistently and verify. The description is too general and could apply to any part of the app, thus not meeting the first criterion that requires a fixed interface of the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**Output: NO**

**Reason:**
1. The scenario describes looking for the 'Wobbly Project' text animation in the text animation options, which seems to refer to a specific feature of an application. However, it is not clear if 'Wobbly Project' is a text animation option that currently exists in the app or if it’s a feature the user is suggesting for addition. If it's a suggested feature, then it doesn't currently exist in the app.

2. While verifying if the text animation options are effective and enhance user experience is helpful, this scenario directly pertains to the existence of a specific feature rather than operational or usability issues.

3. The scenario seems to be an in-app activity and does not occur cross-application. However, based on the point made in the first reason, if the feature mentioned is a user suggestion and does not currently exist, it fails to meet the criteria.

Therefore, due to the uncertainty about whether 'Wobbly Project' is already an existing feature or a user's suggestion for enhancement, the scenario does not firmly meet all three points. Hence, the output is 'NO'.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not specify a particular application page or feature in a manner that is clear and fixed, as it only mentions the 'Wobbly Project' text animation being available in a loop animation option. The description lacks specificity about where this option is located within the app or its usage context, which makes it difficult to confirm if it is a fixed feature or a variable one. Moreover, the scenario is potentially suggesting that more animation options might be preferable, indicating a feature suggestion rather than an existing app issue. There is also no mention of an app-specific interface or situation that ensures consistent presence of the described behavior, failing to meet the criteria of being reproducible.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a cache-clearing action that deletes voiceovers, affecting all projects. This suggests that the scenario is tied to a specific feature of the app and is not a result of randomness or user-suggested features. However, without more context or knowledge about whether this feature of deleting voiceovers upon cache clearing is implemented across all scenarios, it's inconclusive if this issue can occur consistently due to a fixed interface or feature. Furthermore, the scenario might be specific to this app, thus not cross-application, and doesn't mention content-related issues or inappropriate app states like when it's in a small window or background. Given the information, not all criteria are confidently met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the given scenario, let's evaluate it against the three points:

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario "Application only works in Wi-Fi" is likely reproducible because it describes a specific issue related to connectivity. It doesn't mention a specific application page, widget, or feature, but rather a condition (Wi-Fi connectivity), which may be consistently tested. This suggests a reproducible scenario given the app has connectivity-based functionality.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue of the app only working with Wi-Fi can significantly impact application functionality and user experience. Users generally expect apps to work on both Wi-Fi and mobile data, so addressing this scenario can improve app functionality.

3. **Not Cross-Application Issue**: The issue described is related to the app itself and not the way it interacts with other applications. The problem occurs during normal usage (after the app is launched) and is not related to the app being in a small window, in the background, or in a floating status.

Since all three points are met, the output should be:

YES  
Reason: The scenario is reproducible as it relates to a consistent connectivity condition, it impacts the app's functionality rather than content issues, and it occurs during normal app usage without involving other applications.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: While the scenario describes a specific issue that occurs when the app is opened (a black screen followed by the app closing), it does not provide details about a specific application page, widget, or feature beyond the app's initial launch. Therefore, it doesn't meet the first point of being tied to a specific fixed interface beyond the general app opening process. Additionally, since the issue occurs upon opening the app, it may not be tied to a specific feature intended to enhance user experience aside from the general functionality of opening an app, which does not meet the criteria of the second point. Lastly, it doesn't clearly indicate that the issue only occurs after the app is started normally and not in other statuses like small window or background, thus partially contradicting the third point.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**
**Reason:** The scenario "Export the video in the app, but it crashes every time" does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature in detail. The description is vague and lacks specificity regarding where or how the exporting feature is accessed or used within the app, which makes it less straightforward to reproduce. Additionally, it's unclear if this is a persistent issue across all users or devices, which could suggest it might be a random occurrence based on specific user configurations or conditions.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "Make videos quickly using the app templates" does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature. It broadly mentions using templates to create videos quickly, which may or may not be a predefined feature in the app. The scenario lacks specificity and thus cannot be firmly identified as reproducible based on a fixed interface. Moreover, the scenario may imply a suggestion for improvement rather than describing an existing feature, making it unclear if the feature currently exists within the app as described.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not clearly reproducible as it describes a general issue ("no internet connection") without specifying a particular application page, widget, or feature. This makes it difficult to reproduce consistently across different environments or devices.  
2. While resolving a "no internet connection" issue could help improve user experience, the scenario lacks specific context or functionality information to be considered a feature improvement. It appears to be more of a connectivity issue rather than a functional deficiency or enhancement need.  
3. The scenario, focusing on a connectivity error, does not necessarily imply cross-application status, but without more precise application context, it's difficult to assess fully the in-app behavior when started normally. The description does not give enough clarity on whether the scenario strictly adheres to non-random, fixed interface conditions.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described as "The app glitches frequently" is too vague and non-specific. It does not identify a specific application page, widget, or feature where the issue occurs. Without detailing a fixed interface or a consistent condition under which the problem appears, there's no concrete basis to reproduce the scenario effectively. Moreover, the description lacks information on how the glitch affects the application functionality, making it difficult to determine if it genuinely enhances user experience or improves app functions.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the scenario provided:

1. **Reproducibility**: 
   - The scenario specifically mentions "using the tracking button after it has been fixed." There is a specific feature mentioned (tracking button), which implies that the action of using this button should have a fixed interface and not appear randomly. No additional features suggested by the user for addition are mentioned.
  
2. **Helpful for Improvement**:
   - The issue relates to a functional aspect of the app (tracking button), which is crucial for improving app functionalities and enhancing user experience. It does not mention content-related issues such as ads or inaccurate content.

3. **Cross-application and App Status**:
   - The scenario is about a feature within a specific app (tracking button), suggesting it is not cross-application. Additionally, it implies normal operation of the app, not affected by being in a small window, background, or floating status.

Based on the above analysis, all three points are satisfied:

YES  
Reason: The scenario describes a specific, reproducible feature (tracking button), is relevant to app functionality improvement, and is contained within the application's normal operational context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario's description, "Unable to edit videos correctly to match music because the video stops right before where the clip is split/changed," does meet some criteria but fails others. 

1. The scenario describes a specific application feature (video editing) and seems to be related to a fixed interface of the application.
2. The feature described, proper functioning of video editing when matching videos to music, is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience.
3. However, the scenario description does not provide explicit information on whether the issue occurs only when the app is started normally or also in other states (small window, background, etc.).

Without clear evidence that the scenario does not occur when the app is in small window, background, or floating status and occurs only when the app is started normally, the criteria cannot be fully validated. Therefore, the answer is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
1) NO
Reason: 

The scenario described partially meets your criteria but fails the very first point:

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The user comment specifically describes trying to add texts for subtitles or overlays to a video that is 1 minute or longer, resulting in the application freezing. The scenario describes using specific features (adding text for subtitles or overlays) within a fixed interface of the application, and it does not appear to mention features suggested for addition. Therefore, it meets the reproducibility and specificity criteria.

2. **Helpful for Improving Application Functions**: The scenario mentions a functional issue (app freezing while adding subtitles or overlays) which is definitely a problem tied to app performance. Fixing this would undoubtedly improve the user experience as it would make the app more stable and reliable.

3. **Non-Cross-Application**: The scenario occurs within the CapCut app when it is started normally, and does not refer to any other application or mention small-window, background, or floating statuses. 

However, considering the criteria that all three points must be met for a "YES":

- "1 minute or longer" does not specify if this issue might sporadically occur in other circumstances or whether it’s deterministic and bound to only 1-minute-long videos. Therefore, the description lacks precision regarding the exact scenario where the bug can be consistently reproduced.

Due to the slight ambiguity in point 1 regarding reproducibility specifics for different video lengths around the 1-minute mark, the most cautious decision is:

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario, let's evaluate it according to the criteria given:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario mentions "unexpected lags that cause the user to get kicked out of the app." This is a performance issue that could be tied to specific actions or pages within an app, but the description is vague and does not specify any particular page, widget, or feature. It is described as an "unexpected" occurrence, which suggests it may be intermittent or random rather than consistently reproducible on a specific interface.

2. **Feature Impact**: The described issue is related to app functionality and performance (lagging and crashes), which are aspects critical to user experience improvement. Therefore, it is considered a functional issue rather than a content-related one.

3. **Cross-application & Operational Status**: The scenario mentions the issue occurs after the app is started normally and does not specify any cross-application involvement or status issues (like running in the background or in a floating window).

Given these points, the key reason for not meeting all criteria is the lack of specificity in reproducibility concerning a fixed interface or feature, as it describes an unexpected and unspecified situation.

**Output**:  
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an unexpected performance issue without specifying a reproducible interface or feature.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Split a video, but it doesn't work correctly, can be fixed by exiting out and going back in.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  

1. The scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific feature or functionality of the app, which is the ability to split a video. This feature is expected to be a consistent part of the app's interface and is not described as random or dependent on suggested improvements.

2. The issue with the video splitting not working correctly and the workaround of exiting and re-entering the app pertains to improving the application's functionality and enhancing user experience. It does not involve content-related issues like ads or inaccurate content.

3. The scenario is contained within the app itself and does not reference any cross-application behavior. It also specifies that the issue occurs when the app is started normally, ruling out problems related to the app running in the background or in a floating status.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason:
While the scenario described seems specific and relates to a particular feature (editing a video and exporting a photo or video within the edit), it does not necessarily confirm that the issue isn't content-related or ad-related. The description provided by the user focuses on a functional problem (crashing during export), but doesn't rule out the possibility of ads or content-related issues interfering with the process. The requirement specified for the feature to "improve application functions and enhancing user experience" appears to be met, but due to the absence of information confirming that the problem isn't caused by extraneous factors like ads or content inaccuracies, the criteria are not wholly fulfilled.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a missing feature, which indicates that it does not currently exist in the app, thus failing the reproducibility requirement. Additionally, the scenario appears to hinge on a specific feature's absence rather than describing a fixed interface or page.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario provided is: "Open the app after a phone update, and the app crashes then closes." 

While the scenario is specific and seems reproducible, it does not describe an interaction with a specific application page or widget/feature. Crashes upon opening the app after a phone update can vary widely depending on numerous factors, such as different phone models, OS versions, and configurations. This crash scenario may not necessarily result from a fixed interface or specific feature within the app itself, but rather might be tied to compatibility issues related to the phone update.

Hence, it does not meet the first criterion, which requires the scenario to describe a specific application page or widget/feature and to be related to a fixed interface of the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempting to reopen the app, but it crashes every time.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described ("Attempting to reopen the app, but it crashes every time") does not specify a particular interface or feature within the app. It describes a general issue related to the app crashing upon reopening, which is not tied to a specific page or widget. This indicates that it might not be a fixed interface issue and could be related to various factors such as device configuration or app version, which are outside the scope of fixed interface problems. Hence, it does not meet the first criterion for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described ("Learning to edit videos effectively after understanding the app's functionalities") is too vague and does not specify a particular feature, interface, or widget of the app. There is no indication of a specific page or tool within the application that is part of a fixed interface, which makes it difficult to determine if it's a reproducible issue. Additionally, the scenario does not specify a particular problem or improvement area within the application's existing functionality but rather hints at a learning curve, which could be subjective and varies from user to user.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:

Reason:...
**YES**  
Reason: 

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario is reproducible as it describes a specific action ("press the full screen button") on a specific type of content ("16/9 videos") in a specific environment (Android). This indicates a fixed interface and not a random occurrence.
   
2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue of the full screen button not working properly is related to application functionality. Improving this feature would enhance the user experience by ensuring that the app works as expected when users try to view videos in full screen.
   
3. **Application-Specific**: The scenario is specific to the described app's feature (full screen mode for 16/9 videos) and does not involve interactions with other applications.

Reason: The scenario described in the user comment partially meets the conditions. It identifies a specific feature issue (templates not working and being prompted to update) that can be reproduced in a normal app-startup environment and is not related to in-app content or cross-application issues. However, it lacks explicit details about a specific application page or widget interface, as it vaguely mentions "Some templates" without identifying which ones or where in the app they are located.

### Scenario Analysis:
#### User Comment Scenario: "When I put a sticker on my wallpaper, an error message appears."

#### Analysis Breakdown:

1. **Reproducibility**:
   - The scenario mentions a specific action performed on a specific feature (`put a sticker on my wallpaper`), and it seems to describe a fixed interface within the application. There is no indication that this scenario appears randomly.
   
2. **Feature Relevance**:
   - The problem is related to a functionality (`put a sticker on my wallpaper`) which is part of the application's feature set and not content-related issues like ads or content accuracy.
   
3. **Application Context**:
   - The scenario describes an issue that occurs during normal operation of the app (`when the app is started normally`) and not when the app is in a small window or in the background.

Based on the given criteria:

1) **Reproducibility**: YES, because the scenario describes a specific action in a specific feature of the app and does not appear to be random.
2) **Feature Relevance**: YES, because the described scenario involves a feature of the app and aims to improve user experience.
3) **Application Context**: YES, because the issue occurs during normal operation of the app.

Therefore, all three criteria are met.

### Output:
```plaintext
YES
Reason: The scenario is reproducible, related to a specific application feature that enhances user experience, and occurs during normal application use.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario might not be reproducible as it involves attempting to freeze a video clip and save it to the device gallery, which may depend on user-specific settings or circumstances. Additionally, it does not mention a specific page, feature, or widget within the CapCut app, making it unclear whether this is a consistent, fixed interface issue. Furthermore, the description does not clarify whether the video freezing feature is currently available in the app or is a suggested feature.

2. Saving video clips to the gallery is certainly a useful feature for users, as it enables further editing in different apps and enhances the overall user experience of the application. Therefore, the issue, if present, would be relevant in terms of app functionality rather than content-related problems.

3. The scenario doesn't clearly specify any cross-application context or occur in the minimized/background state of the app, as it focuses on saving within the app itself. However, without consistent reproducibility based on the description, it is difficult to fully ascertain the validity of this point.  

Due to the lack of clarity regarding specific app interface elements and whether the feature exists or is a user suggestion, the scenario does not satisfy all the necessary criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**Output: NO**

**Reason:**

1. **Reproducibility:**
   - Yes, it is a reproducible scenario. The user describes specific steps: exporting an unfinished edit, taking a screenshot from the device gallery, editing the image on another app, and then returning to CapCut. This sequence can be executed by any user following the instructions.

2. **Helpful for Enhancing User Experience:**
   - The scenario does describe a way in which user experience can be improved by highlighting the lack of a "freeze save" feature in CapCut. This information is useful for developers to know what features users find lacking or inconvenient.

3. **Cross-Application Scenario:**
   - The scenario involves using two different mobile apps: CapCut and another app for image editing. This violates the condition that the scenario cannot be cross-application. The issue arises from the limitation in one app (CapCut) being mitigated by using another app.

**Conclusion:**
- Since the scenario involves the use of two applications, it does not meet the third point. Therefore, the answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described is too vague and lacks specificity. It mentions that "the app has bugs which is frustrating for the user when playing Zepeto and needing to use the app." This does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature where the issue occurs. It also does not confirm that the issue appears consistently or is tied to a fixed interface of the application.

NO
Reason: The scenario "Text animation is quite glitchy" could potentially be reproducible and relevant to improving application functions and enhancing user experience. However, the description provided lacks specificity regarding the application page, widget, or feature involved. It does not specify whether the glitchy text animation happens on a particular screen or throughout the entire application, making it difficult to determine if the glitch is a fixed interface issue or appears randomly.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To evaluate the scenario based on the conditions you've provided, let's go through each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario does not describe any specific user scenario related to app features. It mentions that "No specific continuous user scenarios related to app features are described." Therefore, it doesn't describe a specific application page or widget/feature. Since there is no specific feature or page mentioned, we cannot determine if it is a fixed interface or appears randomly. Moreover, there are no user-suggested features mentioned that would indicate the absence of current features in the app.

2. **Helpfulness in improving app functions**: Since no specific features or scenarios are described, there is no information on whether the scenario could help improve application functions or enhance user experience. The scenario doesn’t mention any features, whether content-related or otherwise, thus there's no basis for assessing helpfulness.

3. **App-specific Scenario**: As there's no specific scenario or feature described, it's not possible to confirm that the issue is isolated to within one app and not affected by interactions with other apps. 

Based on the above assessment:

NO
Reason: The scenario does not describe any app-specific page, widget, or feature, making it non-reproducible and unhelpful for improving application functions. It lacks the specificity needed to meet each of the three criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The music search function is unable to find or sort any locally stored sound or song.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a problem with the music search function not finding or sorting locally stored sounds or songs. The user might be suggesting that the app does not currently have this feature or it is not functioning as expected. However, it's unclear if this is a fixed issue or a random occurrence, and the comment does not provide specific details about whether it's related to a specific application page or widget. Additionally, the absence of this functionality could imply a feature request rather than a reproducible problem. Therefore, not all the points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The in-app file explorer's search function doesn't work at all.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario mentions that the in-app file explorer's search function doesn't work. This meets the requirements for a specific application page and widget (in-app file explorer with search function), and it's a fixed interface that does not appear randomly. It addresses a functional issue that can help improve the app and enhance user experience, rather than content-related issues or advertisement-related complaints. The situation is also specific to this app and does not require cross-application checking. Lastly, it does not mention occurring in a small window or background status, implying it occurs after the app is started normally.

However, there is one consideration missing: we need to ensure that this functionality (an in-app file explorer with a search function) already exists in the app and is not a suggested feature for addition by the user. Since this critical detail is not confirmed based on the provided comment, we cannot be sure if the feature actually exists in the app.

Therefore, without this confirmation, we cannot fully meet the requirement that the feature described in the scenario should not be a user-suggested addition, leading to the overall judgment: NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The songs that can be found aren't sorted in any meaningful way (alphabetical or otherwise).Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The issue of songs not being sorted is a feature-related concern that can occur on a specific page or widget within the app related to song browsing or playlists, so it could be reproducible.  
2. The scenario is relevant to improving application functions and enhancing user experience, as sorting songs can make navigation easier for users.  
3. However, it is unclear whether this is a cross-application scenario without more details about which app is being referenced. Additionally, the issue isn't caused by the app's status (small window, in the background, etc.).  

Since it's not evident whether this applies directly to a specific app without cross-application context, the criterion on cross-application scenarios is not satisfied.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Make impressive videos using CAPCUT by applying personal preferences, music, and text to promote a brand.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**YES/NO**

**Reason:**

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity:**
   The scenario describes using CAPCUT to make impressive videos by applying personal preferences, music, and text. This indicates the use of specific features within the app rather than suggesting new ones that do not currently exist. Video editing features, applying music, and adding text are fundamental parts of CAPCUT, and these features are not randomly appearing or disappearing. They are typical functionalities of a video editing app, making the scenario reproducible.

2. **Feature Enhancement and User Experience:**
   The scenario involves creating videos to promote a brand, which is inherently linked to improving the app's functions and enhancing the user experience. Adding personal preferences, music, and text are core functions of video editing, which are critical for promoting brands and creating content. Thus, it fits the criteria of features that improve functionality and user experience.

3. **App-Specific Scenario:**
   The scenario occurs within CAPCUT, detailing the use of its features to make videos. There’s no mention of using it in a background, small window, or floating status, and it requires the app to be started normally. It is not reliant on cross-application functionality.

Thus, this scenario meets all three points.

**YES**
**Reason:** The scenario is reproducible, involves features that enhance the application’s functions and user experience, and is specific to the CAPCUT app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Exported videos sometimes have glitches, and the only solution is to recreate the project.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**

**Reason:**
1. **Reproducibility**: The user's problem scenario of "exported videos sometimes have glitches" implies that the glitches may occur randomly and are not specific to a fixed interface or a specific application page or widget/feature. The term "sometimes" suggests inconsistency, making it potentially hard to reproducibly trigger the issue.
 
2. **Feature Description**: The scenario does describe an issue with a feature that is directly related to the video's functionality (exporting videos), which is essential for the app's primary use and thus improves the user's experience. This point is met.

3. **Cross-Application**: The scenario does not mention any cross-application behavior and assumes the app is operating normally, which is in line with this point's requirements.

Since the first point about reproducibility is not clearly satisfied due to the randomness described ("sometimes have glitches"), the final judgment is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario described mentions changes in font/animation positions from time to time or from version to version, which indicates that the behavior may not be consistent or fixed and might vary across different versions of the app. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that the scenario can be consistently reproduced. Additionally, the comment does not specifically mention a particular application page or widget, which makes it less clear if this problem consistently applies to a single, fixed interface.

Reason: The scenario described relates to a transition speed restriction of one second, making it fast and unattractive. However, it does not specify a particular application page or widget/feature where this transition occurs.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  

1. The scenario is potentially reproducible because it describes specific actions (editing a long video) on specific features/pages of the app (video editing feature/timeline), indicating a fixed user interface scenario rather than a random occurrence. The scenario does not suggest new features but mentions issues with existing functionality.  

2. The issue described (app freezing or timeline not moving during video editing) relates to app functionality and user experience, as it directly affects the primary purpose of the application without involving content-related issues or advertisements.  

3. The scenario explicitly addresses a function that seems integral to the app's core features and occurs after the app is normally started, suggesting the problem is contained within the app itself and not dependent on cross-application interactions or different app states like minimized or floating.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue that seems potentially related to the network configuration specific to the user's country, where TikTok is banned. This might not be easily reproducible in a different country where access to TikTok is not barred. The blocking of TikTok might be affecting CapCut due to cross-application dependencies or shared services between the apps, such as authentication or network checks. The issue appears to be more of a cross-application or country-specific network issue rather than something that can be pinpointed to a specific page or widget within CapCut itself. The scenario does not describe a specific application page or feature malfunction within CapCut independently of the network situation specific to that user's region.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario does not specify a specific application page, widget, or feature where the text-centering issue occurs. It simply states a general problem with centering text after an update, without enough detail to identify if it's tied to a fixed interface or a particular section of the app. Thus, it lacks the necessary specificity to confirm that the issue occurs consistently within a non-random interface of the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario involves cross-application functionality between TikTok and CapCut, which violates point 3. The issue described pertains to the integration between two separate applications, which is not limited to CapCut alone. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement that the scenario be confined to a single application's interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario describes a specific functionality (transferring saved audio) between two apps (TikTok and CapCut), which implies a cross-application interaction. This violates point 3, as it is not a fixed interface of a single application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific feature (editing sound) within the CapCut application that is likely a fixed interface and not random. It mentions a specific issue where the sound cuts off in the last few seconds, indicating a potential bug in the editing feature rather than a feature suggestion.  
2. This feature is related to the core functionality of CapCut, which is video editing. Improving this feature would enhance user experience by ensuring that users can accurately work with their audio tracks, thus it is not a content-related issue.  
3. The scenario is specific to CapCut and does not involve cross-application issues. It only occurs when the app is used normally, and not in minimized or background status.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempting to position the sounds where desired, but the sounds do not align or go to the intended position.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user comment seems to be related to a feature of positioning sounds in the app. It may be reproducible if positioning sounds is a fixed feature of the application interface. However, there is insufficient information to determine whether this is a specific, non-randomly appearing feature without more context about the app. Additionally, the scenario seems to primarily focus on a functional issue rather than a content-related problem, which would help improve user experience. The information provided does not indicate cross-application issues, nor does it pertain to problems arising when the app is run in small window, background, or floating status. Nevertheless, due to the lack of information, especially regarding whether the scenario occurs consistently across specific pages or widgets, all three points cannot be conclusively met. Thus, the output is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Experiencing the app sometimes freezing while in use.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario described ("Experiencing the app sometimes freezing while in use") does not meet all three points. Specifically:

1. The scenario does not describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature. It mentions that the app "sometimes freezes" while in use, which suggests the issue occurs randomly and not in a fixed interface of the application.
   
2. The scenario is about the app freezing, which is indeed a performance issue and helpful in improving application functions and user experience. It is not a content-related issue.

3. The scenario description does not suggest that it occurs in a cross-application context or when the app is in a small window, background, or floating status. However, due to the vague nature of the description and its indication of random occurrence, it is not possible to confirm the exact conditions under which the app freezes consistently.

Thus, because point 1 is not satisfied due to lack of specificity and randomness of the issue, the answer is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Pro subscription kept requiring age verification, and the age verification process is broken and has instructions in Chinese.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario describes encountering issues with a Pro subscription requiring age verification and the age verification process having instructions in Chinese, which seems reproducible and specific to a particular feature of the application. This meets the criteria for reproducibility and improving user experience (points 1 and 2). However, the scenario might not inherently imply that the issue is cross-application or dependent on certain app states. Given the broad nature of potential subscription-related issues and nuances that could appear in different app states (like pop-ups or specific subscription pages), it is not explicitly clear that all conditions in point 3 are met. Therefore, based on available information, it doesn't conclusively meet all criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue ("freezes the screen") related to a specific interaction with the app ("click on animations"), suggesting it may be a fixed interface issue and not random. It focuses on app functionality, potentially affecting user experience. However, without knowing if clicking on "animations" is a built-in feature or interface within the app, we can't confirm its reproducibility. Since the task requires all three points, and reproducibility is uncertain, it doesn't fully meet the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

2. The feature described (editing functionality) is essential for improving application functions and enhancing user experience as it is a key interactive feature.
3. The scenario is specific to the app itself and does not involve interactions with or issues caused by other applications. It occurs when the app is started normally and not in a minimized or background state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described (user frustration with many features costing money) is too general and does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature. It does not meet the criterion of being a fixed interface that can be specifically identified and reproduced. Additionally, the scenario could be broadly related to various aspects of the app and does not describe a function that can directly be improved for user experience enhancement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario, let's evaluate the conditions:

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: 
   - The scenario describes a specific problem occurring with the Chrome browser update process on a Moto G Stylus device. This involves pressing the update button, the update starting and stopping, and the update button reappearing in a cycle. This is a specific functionality issue related to the update feature of the Chrome app.
   - The problem interface described (update mechanism) is a fixed feature of the application that is consistently available and should not appear randomly. Therefore, it is potentially reproducible if the issue persists under the same conditions.

2. **Improvement of Application Functions**:
   - The described scenario affects the functionality of the app as it relates to updates. Ensuring smooth updates is crucial for both app performance and user satisfaction. This is indeed a functional issue rather than a content-related issue (like ads or content accuracy).

3. **Cross-application Issues**: 
   - The scenario is specific to the Chrome app on a Moto G Stylus and does not mention involvement of any other applications, so it does not involve cross-application functionality.

Considering all points are met, the scenario meets the specified criteria.

Output:

YES  
Reason: The scenario describes a specific, reproducible issue with the update feature of the Chrome app that affects application functionality without involving cross-application issues.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: The scenario involves actions related to the Chrome app (force-stopping and disabling it) to resolve an update issue. This indicates a cross-application scenario involving interactions between the mobile app and the Chrome app. The issue mentioned is not isolated to a single specific application page or widget/feature, and managing updates by force-stopping and disabling another app is not a built-in feature of the original mobile app being maintained. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of not being cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario describes "navigating through multiple automatic groups that the user did not create," which implies a potential feature or behavior of the app. However, it lacks specificity about whether these groups are a fixed interface or feature that consistently appears, and doesn't concern user-suggested features. It also doesn't explicitly state the context within the app where this occurs, such as a specific page or widget. Therefore, it doesn't fully meet all criteria for reproducibility as a fixed part of the interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario mentions "encounters a teensy, non-flowable font size with words and icons half the cell phone width," which suggests a consistent interface display issue. However, it does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature of the app where this issue consistently appears, making it unclear if the scenario is reproducible across different situations or upon restarting the app.

2. The description points to a display issue, which is indeed relevant for improving user experience as it affects readability and usability. However, since point 1 is not clearly met, this doesn't solely meet all criteria.

3. The scenario does not mention anything about operating in a small window, background, or floating state versus normal startup, so it doesn't violate the conditions given.  

Despite addressing points 2 and 3 to a certain extent, the lack of clarity regarding the specific interface or feature makes it uncertain if this issue is reproducible across all intended scenarios. Therefore, the output is 'NO'.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: 
1. The scenario does not mention a specific application page, widget, or feature that consistently triggers the issue, nor does it describe a fixed interface. It is unclear if this occurs under specific circumstances or conditions within a particular app.
2. The scenario involves a potentially intrusive location setting rather than a functional improvement or enhancement to the user experience, making it more of a privacy or control issue rather than an enhancement of app functionality.
3. The scenario exhibits a behavior that seems to stem from system-level pop-up prompts from Google services, which can appear across different applications. This suggests a cross-application issue rather than an issue isolated to a single app interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario mentioned involves the "Open in new tab in group" option, which indicates the user is suggesting a feature that is currently missing from the application. Since the feature does not exist in the app at present, it does not meet the criterion that the scenario should describe a specific application widget/feature that exists and is not merely a user suggestion for addition. Therefore, the scenario is not reproducible.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: The scenario described — "Using Chrome and it automatically shuts down or closes during use" — lacks specific details regarding a particular application page or widget that leads to the shutdown. It describes a random and non-specific behavior, making it not reliably reproducible. Additionally, the issue might be due to cross-application interactions, for instance, interference with system processes, which violates point 3. As a result, not all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To determine whether the given scenario meets all the specified points, let's analyze each one:

1. **Is the scenario reproducible?**  
   The scenario describes a specific action: opening the Google widget bar on the home page, with a specific consequence: it automatically closes after opening. This suggests a fixed interface of the application (the Google widget bar), which is not affected by random factors. It is not a new feature suggestion but rather a description of what happens when you perform a certain action with an existing feature. Therefore, this point is met.

2. **Is the feature described helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience?**  
   Automatically closing a widget bar after opening it can impair user experience, especially if it's not intended behavior. Addressing this issue could enhance the app's usability and stability, thus improving user experience. It's not content-related or about ads, so this point is also met.

3. **Is the scenario restricted to a single application and not cross-application?**  
   The scenario involves the Google widget bar, likely specific to a particular app or home screen functionality. It does not involve interactions beyond the scope of one application. The issue is described to happen when the app is started normally, and there's no mention of multi-window or floating windows affecting the behavior. Therefore, this point is also met.

Given that all three criteria are satisfied, the output will be:

```
YES
Reason: The scenario is specific, reproducible, improves usability by addressing a functional issue, and is restricted to a single app's functionality without involving cross-app interaction.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario "Updates not installed in the mobile Chrome application" is not reproducible in the sense of a specific page or feature within the application. It describes a general issue related to app updates, which could be a result of various factors outside of the application's immediate UI, such as device settings or internet connection.  
2. While ensuring updates are installed is a critical function, the scenario itself is not a direct feature within the app but rather a process managed by the app store or device, thus not improving the direct user-function interaction or experience within the app's specific UI components.  
3. The issue is not strictly within the app itself and involves external or cross-application processes, as updates could be related to app store behavior or device settings rather than the Chrome app's interface or functionalities.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:After the update, when opening a link on an Android phone, the page now opens on the same tab instead of in a separate tab as it did before. The user cannot find a way to return to the previous tab grid settings.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is describing behavior that appears to be tied to the change in functionality after an update, specifically the page opening in the same tab instead of a new one. This change is an issue with the way the app handles links, rather than a fixed interface or a widget. The issue described isn't a permanent, unchanging feature of the app, but rather a change that occurred with the update. So, it doesn't fit the criteria of a fixed interface that doesn't appear randomly.  

2. The feature described here (opening links in a separate tab) seems to be more of a behavior or preference, not necessarily a core enhancement to the app’s functionality. While it can impact user experience, it doesn’t directly improve core functionality or features in a substantial way. It’s more about how the app handles navigation, which could be a preference or usability issue rather than a major functional enhancement.

3. The issue described seems to be app-specific rather than involving any cross-application issues. It seems tied to a specific behavior within the app itself, but the scenario isn't addressing interactions between multiple apps. However, it involves the app's behavior when starting up normally, not when in small windows or in the background. Therefore, it is consistent with the app's usual operation.

I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The app crashes continuously within a second of opening it, despite restarting the phone and disabling and re-enabling the app.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a crash occurring "continuously within a second of opening" the app. However, it doesn't specify any particular page or feature of the app where this happens. It could be occurring randomly, depending on various factors like app state, device performance, or network conditions. Therefore, the scenario does not describe a fixed interface or specific feature.
   
2. **Feature relevance**: The issue described is related to a crash, which is a functional problem that impacts user experience, and not related to content like "inaccurate content" or "too many ads." This point is met.

3. **Cross-application issue**: The scenario is app-specific since it describes a crash that happens when the app is launched and does not specify conditions related to being in a small window or background, which suggests it is happening during normal app operation. This point is met.

Because point 1 is not fully satisfied (lack of specific interface or feature mentioned), the answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not explicitly describe a specific application page or widget/feature with a fixed interface that appears consistently. The mention of a "user interface similar to that of a PC's Chrome browser" is vague and does not specify a particular feature or page within the app. Additionally, the scenario lacks sufficient detail to assess whether the interface is a fixed part of the application versus something that occurs randomly or is unintended. Therefore, it does not fulfill the criteria to judge if the scenario is reproducible or specific enough based on the points outlined.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Log into social media while using incognito mode in Chrome, leave to use another app, come back to Chrome, and find that the user is logged out.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario is related to using incognito mode in Chrome. Incognito mode is designed to not retain session information once the user navigates away from the browser or closes it. Hence, this behavior of being logged out is expected and is not an issue within Chrome or the social media application itself. It is a feature of incognito mode.

2. **Feature Usefulness**: The scenario does not describe a feature within a specific application but is instead related to browser behavior, specifically the functionality of incognito mode. Adjusting this behavior would involve changing how incognito mode works, which is unlikely because it would defeat its purpose of privacy.

3. **Cross-Application**: This scenario involves both a social media app and the Chrome browser, meaning it inherently involves multiple applications. It violates the condition that scenarios cannot be cross-application, as logging in and session management for most apps are separate from how incognito mode functions in the browser. 

Therefore, the scenario does not meet all three criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a user's preference for a feature that is not currently available in the app, specifically the ability to use a browsing mode that does not require clearing history regularly. This suggests that the scenario is based on a feature request rather than an existing issue with a specific feature or page. Since the feature is not currently part of the app, it cannot be reproduced in its current form, which does not meet the first criteria for being reproducible based on a fixed interface. Additionally, the scenario involves a feature suggestion, which rules it out from meeting the specified requirements.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described includes the interaction between two different applications—Chrome and the keyboard app. Cross-application issues do not meet the criteria for being specific to a single application's interface, widget, feature, or functionality.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not describe a fixed interface or specific feature of the application; instead, it relates to the keyboard, which is a system-level feature or separate app and not part of the specific app being reviewed. Therefore, the problem scenario might not be reproducible within the confines of the specific app itself. Additionally, the issue described (keyboard crashing) seems to be related to a cross-application problem rather than an in-app problem, as it involves the interaction between the app and the keyboard rather than a feature within the app itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario describes a general issue with accessing help options resulting in going in circles and not resolving the issue. It does not specify a particular application page or a distinct widget/feature, making it less reproducible. Furthermore, the issue seems related to navigation or user interface design, rather than a unique, identifiable feature of the app. Additionally, the complaint is about navigation inefficiency within general app functions rather than a content-related issue.

NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a user's request for a new feature (a settings option for displaying all page titles and descriptions), which implies it is not currently present in the app. Therefore, the scenario is not reproducible as it suggests a feature addition, not an existing issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Google Chrome opens web pages that the user did not intend to visit.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility and specificity**: The scenario described ("Google Chrome opens web pages that the user did not intend to visit") is not specific enough to confirm reproducibility. There is no clear description of which page or feature is causing this, and it could be an issue that occurs randomly or under certain conditions, making it difficult to determine if it is a fixed, repeatable scenario.
  
2. **Helpfulness for improving functionality**: This issue does describe a behavior that is potentially problematic for users, but it doesn’t provide actionable insights on how to improve the functionality of the app. It focuses on a vague behavior (unexpected web pages opening) rather than providing concrete details that would lead to better user experience or specific improvements.

3. **Cross-application issue**: The problem could potentially involve external factors, such as interaction with background apps, settings, or external links. The scenario doesn’t clarify whether this issue is unique to Chrome or involves cross-application behavior, which makes it harder to pinpoint the problem to Chrome alone.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "Google Chrome pops up content (unspecified) unexpectedly" does not describe a specific application page or feature within Google Chrome. It is a vague description that does not specify what content is being popped up, making it difficult to reproduce consistently. Additionally, this could potentially be a cross-application issue, where another app or system feature is causing Chrome to open unexpectedly, rather than an issue that occurs strictly within the normal usage of Chrome itself. Since it does not meet all the conditions for a fixed, reproducible scenario, the output is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario described is not sufficiently specific. It mentions that "music plays through the user's earbuds without their action," but does not clarify if this issue occurs consistently or on a specific page or feature of the app. Without more context, it's unclear if this happens in a fixed interface or is a random occurrence.  
   
2. **Feature Helpful for User Experience**: The scenario mentions an unintended behavior (music playing without the user's action), which is more of a bug or malfunction rather than a feature that would improve the user experience. This issue relates to app behavior rather than a new or useful feature.

3. **Cross-Application**: The scenario might not necessarily be related to cross-application behavior but instead refers to how the app functions when actively used. Without more details, it’s uncertain whether the issue is app-specific or involves interactions with other apps (e.g., audio players, system features).I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility & Specific Application Interface:** The scenario described involves Chrome crashing shortly after launch, which suggests it is a reproducible issue upon starting the app. However, it doesn't describe a specific feature or widget within the app but rather the overall app's behavior, which may be more general and potentially not fixed to a specific interface or page. Since the description is about the app as a whole (Chrome), it doesn't necessarily point to a specific application page or widget, which is required for a fixed interface.

2. **Feature Helpfulness:** The issue described here is related to an app crash, which impacts app functionality and user experience, but the issue described is a performance/technical problem (app crash), not an enhancement or content-related issue. This part is met, as app crashes directly affect the user experience and app's reliability.

3. **Cross-application Issue:** The scenario specifies Chrome crashing, so this issue likely pertains to the Chrome app specifically. It doesn’t indicate cross-application behavior, as it is a problem with a particular app (Chrome), not with multiple apps. Therefore, this point is met.

Since the first point is not fully met (as it doesn’t describe a specific feature or page), the answer is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Difficulty accessing bookmarks and passwords due to the Chrome browser crashing every 7 to 10 seconds.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario is not specific to a fixed application page or feature. The issue involves the Chrome browser crashing intermittently, not a particular feature within a specific app, which makes it more general. The user experience described here pertains to Chrome crashing every 7 to 10 seconds, but it is not tied to a specific in-app interface or widget.
  
2. **Functionality vs. Content**: The scenario does mention a functional problem (browser crashing), which affects the user's ability to access bookmarks and passwords. However, this issue is tied to the behavior of the browser itself (Chrome), rather than a specific feature of the app. Therefore, it does not fall within the app’s scope, making it more of a browser-related issue rather than an app feature issue.

3. **Cross-application issue**: The problem is described as being related to the Chrome browser, so this issue might not be confined to the specific app. Therefore, it could potentially be a cross-application issue if it affects how Chrome operates with different apps or in different scenarios.

Since the problem is related to Chrome crashing, rather than a specific app feature, and is not confined to one app's functionality, the scenario does not meet the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Every time the user searches for a Google affiliate app, they cannot find their card information, are sent back to the login screen, and receive a message that cookies are not active.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario appears to describe an issue related to cookies and login functionality, which suggests it may occur on specific app pages, but the problem seems to happen in a dynamic, recurring loop, which may not be fixed to one interface. It could happen randomly, depending on session states.  
2) The feature described—cookies not being active despite settings—does improve user experience by ensuring smoother functionality, so it isn't content-related.  
3) This issue likely occurs within a single app and isn’t cross-application related, but it is triggered by the app's interaction with web services, so it may not be isolated entirely to one app feature.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user comment does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature within an app that can be reproduced. Instead, it refers to a general issue of unwanted billing that could involve multiple applications and services, such as Google Music or other sites. This makes it a cross-application issue. Additionally, the description does not suggest a specific user interface or interaction within a single app that leads directly to the issue, thus failing to meet the criteria for reproducibility in a fixed interface. The focus on monetary transactions also does not suggest a functionality improvement or enhancement of user experience directly tied to the app's design or features; it's more about user account and transaction management outside the app's core features.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario does not clearly describe a specific application page, widget, or feature. It refers to "any website" or "Google search," which suggests the issue could be external to the app or linked to web browsing behavior rather than a fixed part of the app's interface.
2. **Feature impact**: The described behavior (page refreshing itself) doesn't appear to describe a feature aimed at improving the app's functionality or user experience but rather an issue with page interaction. This doesn't seem to be related to improving core app functionality.
3. **Cross-application**: The issue involves web browsing or a Google search, which indicates that the issue may not be confined to the app itself, but rather an issue that could also occur when the app interacts with external web content. This could be cross-application behavior if the app uses a browser or web view component. 

Therefore, the scenario does not meet the specified criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The app crashes continuously when attempting to perform a search or google something.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:
1. The scenario describes a specific feature of the application (performing a search) that is likely a fixed interface, which may make it reproducible under the right conditions. However, without more information about the app's design or whether this issue occurs in specific versions, it's uncertain if it's consistently reproducible. 

2. The feature described is indeed helpful for enhancing user experience since performing searches is typically a core function in many applications, and ensuring it works correctly is important for usability.

3. The scenario can potentially be cross-application since the action of "googling something" might imply using an external application (like a web browser), which could introduce variability in the problem's appearance, affecting its reproducibility.

Given the uncertainty of reproducibility and potential cross-application implications, the scenario does not meet all three points.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Request for a pure black theme for the app interface and web pages for eye comfort that works across all sites.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario describes a request for a "pure black theme" feature, which suggests that the app does not currently include this feature. Therefore, it is not a reproducible issue since it involves a desired feature addition rather than an existing problem with the current application interface.

2. While the addition of a pure black theme could indeed enhance user experience by providing more eye comfort, the scenario does not fulfill the requirement of describing a current feature or issue.

3. The scenario is specific to the app itself and does not involve cross-application issues. However, since point 1 is not met, this does not affect the final decision.

Since point 1 is not satisfied, the overall output is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario describes an issue with the appearance of icons on the home page after an update. However, it does not specify a fixed application page or feature and doesn't provide enough context to confirm whether the described issue happens consistently on the home page or with particular icons. This could be an isolated problem or related to specific device configurations or updates, making it difficult to claim reproducibility across all users.  
2. The scenario refers to a visual appearance issue, which might be considered more of a design flaw rather than a functional issue. It's more of a content-related issue in the form of dissatisfaction with the design, rather than enhancing the app's core functionality.  
3. The scenario does not describe an issue that can occur across multiple apps or when the app is in the background, so this point is fine. However, the lack of clarity about the reproducibility and the nature of the issue regarding design makes this scenario not fully aligned with the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described does not indicate a specific application page, widget, or feature, and it refers to a general design element – rounded UI elements – rather than a fixed interface or a particular app function. Without specifying where these elements appear or their context, it is difficult to reproduce the issue consistently. Additionally, the scenario focuses on the aesthetic aspect of the app, which may be subjective and less directly tied to functional improvements or enhancements to user experience.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario involves trying to clear cookies on ASDA's page while using the app, but it does not specify a particular app feature or option for clearing cookies that exists in the app at the moment. The problem could be content-related or involve the device's browser settings rather than the app itself, and the user may be suggesting a feature addition. The description does not sufficiently specify the widget or feature intended for this action, nor does it explicitly confirm that it is a fixed interface of the app, hence it does not fully meet the first criteria for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario mentions an attempt to clear data from ASDA's page but does not specify the exact widget or interface element involved (e.g., a button, menu, or setting). The scenario is vague, and it doesn't describe a fixed, repeatable issue in a specific application feature or page. The action of clearing data seems to be a general function, which could potentially vary based on the app's design or state. Therefore, it's unclear if this is a consistent, reproducible issue.
   
2. **Feature Improvement**: The scenario appears to describe a problem with an existing feature (the ability to clear data), which is important for functionality rather than content. However, since it's unclear if the issue pertains to a feature that is already present or if it involves an issue with an existing feature, this point is not fully met.

3. **Non-Cross Application**: The scenario specifically relates to the ASDA app and its functionality, so it does not appear to involve cross-application behavior. This point is met.

Based on the above, the scenario lacks enough detail to clearly meet the criteria for reproducibility, making the answer "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario does not provide enough specific information about a particular application page, widget, or feature to determine if it is reproducible. The comment mentions being "locked out of passwords" and requiring a "passphrase without prior warning or the use of a thumbprint," but it does not detail a specific app feature or interface that can be consistently tested. Furthermore, it is unclear if the scenario occurs with a fixed interface or if it is a randomly occurring issue. Without these specifics, it is challenging to reproduce and consequently improve or maintain application features based on this scenario.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario involves uncertainty about the system to which the passphrase applies, which could cross multiple applications or systems (Android, Chrome browser, or Google account) and does not specify a particular application page or widget. It may also involve settings or features that extend beyond a single app, making it not solely related to the app's internal interface. Additionally, this scenario does not clearly mention a fixed interface issue that appears consistently within the app itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves receiving repeated notifications indicating that the app is unsafe after each update. This does not specify a particular application page or widget/feature but is rather an issue related to notifications that could be considered a broader system interaction or an external security assessment, rather than a fixed interface of the application itself. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for being a fixed interface. Additionally, the problem might pertain to the app's interaction with the mobile operating system's security features rather than a specific functional feature of the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: This scenario does not provide specific details about what is malfunctioning in the app, making it difficult to reproduce. Without specific information about which part of the app is not working or what feature is affected, it is challenging to determine a fixed interface or feature where the issue occurs. Additionally, the scenario does not describe a situation that enhances application functions or user experience since the problem is vague. Therefore, not all points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario's reproducibility depends on the specific functionality of the app and its handling of notifications. While turning off an app might temporarily resolve some issues, the persistence of notifications could be a system-level feature not directly tied to the app's user interface or functionality. Without details on whether these notifications are specifically from the app or part of the device's update prompt, it cannot be assumed to be reproducible as a fixed interface feature.

2. While resolving persistent notifications can certainly improve the user experience, simply turning off the app isn't a feature enhancement - it seems more like a user workaround. The scenario involves notifications, which are not clearly described as a part of the application's internal widget or user interface, making it problematic to judge if improving this aspect would significantly enhance functionality.

3. The scenario describes behavior when the app is turned off, not when it's started normally. Problems persisting after the app is off don't align with the requirement that the scenario occurs when the app is started normally. This contrasts with the user experience focus of analyzing app performance during its intended operational state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario is not fully reproducible in the context of the app's interface as described. The text disappearing from the search bar when switching tabs could be related to specific app behavior, but it lacks clarity on whether it's a fixed or random issue. The scenario mentions switching tabs and text disappearing, but there is no clear indication that it is a consistent problem on a particular page or widget within the app.
2) The issue described relates to the functionality of the app's search bar, which is a core feature that affects user experience. However, this is a specific behavior (text disappearing) that may be seen as a bug, not a feature improvement, but it could still enhance usability if resolved.
3) The scenario could potentially occur in the app, but it is not described as a cross-application issue. It seems specific to the app itself. However, it's not clear whether this issue occurs only when the app is in normal use, as there are no details about the app's behavior in other states like background or floating.

The lack of clear, consistent description and the ambiguity in the scenario's context leads to a "NO" judgment.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described indicates a problem with the search bar refreshing and erasing text when navigating to a different tab or viewing open tabs. This scenario appears to be related to a specific feature within the app and seems reproducible as it mentions a consistent behavior when performing specific actions. It is likely helpful to address this issue as it would enhance user experience by preserving user input when switching tabs. However, there's no explicit mention that this behavior is not occurring in the app's specific modes (e.g., small window, background, pop-up), and the scenario needs to confirm such conditions are not affecting the issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario described ("Google Chrome navigating to web pages that the user did not access intentionally") is not specific to a particular application page, widget, or feature. The issue seems to refer to an undesired action (auto-navigation or misdirection) in the app, but the scenario doesn't detail a fixed interface or specific feature, and it may appear randomly or under certain conditions rather than consistently.
   
2. **Feature Enhancement**: The scenario describes an issue with unintended behavior rather than a feature that could improve user experience. The described issue (involuntary navigation) could negatively impact the experience rather than enhance it, and it's not related to improving functionality.

3. **Cross-Application**: The scenario could be cross-application if it’s related to interactions with background apps, notifications, or other system-level issues that may trigger such behavior in Chrome. It’s not necessarily contained within the app itself.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves unexpected content or pop-ups appearing without user initiation, which suggests that the issue may not be tied to a specific application page or widget. This indicates that it might occur randomly or be dependent on certain conditions rather than being a fixed interface feature. Additionally, the nature of this issue seems related to content disruptions, such as ads or other intrusive elements, rather than a feature that enhances functionality or user experience. Therefore, it does not meet the first and second criteria outlined.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario described—"Music or audio playing through earbuds that the user did not start"—appears to be a **random occurrence**, and is not tied to a specific page, widget, or fixed interface of the app. The scenario is described as an unexpected behavior, which suggests that it may not be reproducible in a specific or consistent manner, making it unlikely to be tied to a fixed interface or specific feature of the app.

2) The scenario does not directly describe a **helpful feature** of the app for improving functionality or enhancing user experience. Rather, it describes an issue of unexpected audio playback, which falls under the category of **bug** or **unwanted behavior**, not a functional enhancement.

3) The scenario **could potentially be cross-application**, since there is no indication that the issue is specific to one app. The problem of unexpected audio playing could be caused by other apps or system settings affecting the audio output.

Thus, all three points are not met, leading to a "NO" answer.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility of the Scenario**: The scenario described – where the latest Chrome and recent rebrands lock up the Android device – lacks specific details needed to reproduce it. The comment does not mention a specific application page, widget, feature, or conditions under which the lockup occurs. Without this information, it cannot be verified as a fixed interface issue rather than a random occurrence.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The scenario appears to be a performance or compatibility issue rather than a feature enhancement. It describes a negative experience (device lockup) rather than suggesting a feature that improves functionality or user experience.

3. **Cross-Application Issue**: The issue involves multiple applications (Chrome-based browsers and switching to Firefox), suggesting a broader system or compatibility issue rather than a problem isolated to a specific application or feature within an app.

Considering these points, the criteria for reproducibility and feature relevance in improving application functions are not met. Hence, the output is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue (Chrome freezing on an S9+ device) that seems to be specific and potentially reproducible. However, it does not provide sufficient detail to pinpoint a specific application page or a specific feature/widget of Chrome that causes the problem. The scenario is also potentially cross-application, as the issue occurs with Chrome on a specific device model, and it's unclear if the problem is with the Chrome app itself or the interaction between the app and the device (Samsung S9+). Additionally, while addressing such freezes can enhance user experience, the scenario lacks detail on whether this issue emerges consistently or randomly. Thus, not all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a condition where developer mode is enabled and the screen is set to flash when apps post notifications without a valid channel. This is a specific setting that can be activated and verified, so it can be considered reproducible. However, the scenario involves a particular behavior of Chrome which may depend on dynamic factors like updates and configuration, rather than a fixed interface element that is consistently reproducible. Therefore, the variability in Chrome's implementation of notification channels might cause the behavior to not be consistently reproducible as described.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The described scenario relates to a technical issue (posting notifications without a valid channel) which can potentially improve user experience by ensuring notifications are handled correctly. It does not involve content-related issues like inaccurate content or excessive ads. Therefore, this point is met.

3. **Cross-Application Scenario**: The problem involves Chrome's behavior under specific conditions, not any cross-application interference since it describes an issue within how Chrome manages notifications. However, it doesn't specify that this behavior does not occur when the app is in small window, background, or floating status, as the problem is related to notification posting. The scenario does not clearly meet this condition as required because it's unclear under which exact conditions (foreground or background) the issue occurs.

Due to these assessments, the conditions are not completely satisfied for a "YES" output, hence the answer is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a fixed UI layout issue where duet buttons are now separated between the top and bottom of the screen, making them hard to reach on a 6-inch phone. This could be reproducible if the app maintains a static interface design, but it isn't clear if this is a consistent issue or if it's specific to the user's phone or app version. The review does not provide enough information about whether this is a recurring issue on the app's interface or a random event.

2. **Feature Description**: The scenario does describe a UI issue related to the layout of duet buttons, which is a fixed feature of the app. It discusses the difficulty of interacting with the UI due to the separation of the buttons. This is not a content-related issue like "inaccurate content" or "too many ads," so this criterion is met.

3. **Cross-application**: The issue is described in the context of the app's user interface (UI) and doesn't seem to occur in a cross-application context or when the app is in the background or a small window. The review only mentions normal use of the app, so this point is met.

However, the first point (reproducibility) is ambiguous. Without confirmation that this layout issue happens consistently for all users (or if it's fixed to the UI), it cannot be guaranteed that this issue would be reproducible in all scenarios, and therefore it doesn't fully meet the required criteria. Hence, the answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described (the app deleting phone numbers) is not specific enough to determine if it corresponds to a fixed feature or interface of the app. It lacks detail about the app's page or widget where this issue occurs.  
2. The issue described is more of a technical or bug-related issue (deletion of phone numbers), which is not a feature that enhances user experience or improves app functionality.  
3. The scenario could potentially involve interactions between other apps or system-level issues (e.g., syncing contacts across apps), which makes it possible to cross-application. 

Therefore, the scenario does not fully meet all three points.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Clicking on the shopping tab, changing the search, and the app getting stuck in the shopping category with the option to select All, Images, etc., removed, requiring the user to open a new tab.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not fully reproducible based on the provided information. The issue seems to involve the app getting "stuck" in the shopping category with missing options (All, Images, etc.), but the specific steps or conditions leading to this issue are not described clearly. Additionally, there's ambiguity about whether this is related to a specific part of the app interface or a widget that would lead to a fixed, repeatable problem. Without more details on how this occurs consistently, it's not clear if it would happen every time in the same way.

2. The feature described is not necessarily improving functionality or enhancing the user experience. The issue centers on the disappearance of interface options (All, Images, etc.), which would be more about fixing a problem in the app's navigation and layout, rather than a deliberate feature designed to improve the app.

3. The scenario could potentially be tied to a specific interaction in the app's UI, making it unlikely to occur across different apps. However, the description does not make it clear whether this problem would happen consistently in a normal session after opening the app.

Hence, the scenario does not fully meet the required conditions.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Google Chrome users are able to provide feedback and opinions by doing short surveys based on their experiences.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario mentions Google Chrome users providing feedback via surveys, but it doesn't specify a fixed interface or feature within the app. It lacks detail on a specific page or widget and might be a general feature, not a consistent or reproducible experience. Additionally, this scenario could potentially occur across other apps or platforms, making it cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
**Reason**:  
- **Point 1**: The scenario does not describe a specific application page or widget but mentions the general use of the "Gemini A.I. (Artificial Intelligence)" feature without providing details about where or how it's accessed. It's unclear whether this feature is always accessible from a fixed location or page, which makes it ambiguous.
- **Point 2**: The scenario focuses on the use of the "Gemini A.I." feature but does not provide details on how this contributes to improving the app's functionality or user experience. The description is general and lacks specifics on whether the feature is beneficial in the way it's used.
- **Point 3**: The scenario could be cross-application since it doesn't clearly state that the app is behaving in a way that is unique to its primary operation. The mention of the "Gemini A.I." feature is vague and could apply in a broader context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Clearing cache is not enough to reduce app data size.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not specify a particular application page or widget/feature where the issue occurs. It generally refers to the app data size being large even after clearing the cache, which is not tied to a specific, reproducible interface or feature within the app. Additionally, the scenario is more about app behavior in managing data rather than a specific user interface issue that can be easily reproduced.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempting to update the app but being unable to do so because the update is not being accepted by the app.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves difficulty in updating the app, but it does not mention a specific application page or feature where this issue occurs. Without specifying a fixed interface element, such as a button or update page, it is difficult to ascertain if the issue can be consistently reproduced under controlled conditions. Additionally, the scenario is more related to the app update process rather than an in-app feature that enhances functionality or user experience directly. There is also no indication that this issue occurs after the app has started normally.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described as "an automatic creation of a clone app" seems more like a system-level issue or potentially a security issue related to the operating system or device settings, rather than a problem that can be reproduced consistently through a specific feature or interface within the app itself. Furthermore, it doesn't explicitly mention a specific application page or widget where this behavior occurs, and it appears to suggest an unexpected or malfunctioning behavior, not a pre-existing feature or fixed interface. It also doesn't specifically describe how this improves user experience or functions in a positive way.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Instant app and links keep opening even though everything is switched off.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described does not meet all three points. Specifically, the description is not specific enough about the app interface or widget/feature involved. It mentions "instant app and links keep opening" but does not clarify whether this refers to a specific app page, widget, or feature that is a fixed part of the app. The mention of "instant app" could indicate a cross-application issue, as it involves external or linked apps or services, which goes against the third requirement that the issue should not be cross-application. Additionally, this scenario seems to be about unwanted behavior (links opening when they shouldn’t), rather than an enhancement or a feature designed to improve functionality. Therefore, it doesn’t fully meet the given criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not clearly reproducible based purely on the information provided. The comment does not specify which application page or widget/feature is causing the problem, making it difficult to consistently replicate the issue without more context.  
2. While the feature regarding notifications is potentially helpful in improving user experience by reducing unnecessary alerts, the comment alone doesn't give enough specifics to address this through development changes.  
3. The scenario could potentially relate to cross-application interactions, such as the interaction between the Google sign-in service and the target app’s notification settings, which is not confined to a single app's operation. The detail regarding "Google sign-in" might indicate cross-app interactions, violating the requirement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "Links do not work as expected" does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the application, making it unclear whether it is a fixed interface issue or something that appears randomly. Without specifics, it cannot be determined if the problem is reproducible. Additionally, the comment does not specify any cross-application behavior or indicate that the issue arises due to the app's minimized or background state. The lack of detail prevents a comprehensive analysis for meeting the listed criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario is not entirely clear or detailed enough to ensure reproducibility as it does not specify the exact conditions or steps taken before searching for "kicrisoft rewards," such as the app version, device type, or any intermediary actions. While it involves a specific action—searching and attempting to open a website—it's unclear if the issue consistently reoccurs under the same conditions. Furthermore, the redirection issue might be due to network or content-related issues rather than app functionality. Therefore, it does not meet all the criteria for reproducibility and function improvement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario lacks specificity about a particular application page or widget, making it difficult to determine if it is a fixed interface issue. While it relates to a feature that can enhance user experience, the description is too broad and could stem from content-related issues such as "inaccurate content." Additionally, without more details, it is not clear if the issue is cross-application or exclusive to the normal startup status, as required by the guidelines.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user comment does not mention a specific feature, page, or widget of the Chrome browser that consistently leads to a problem. It refers to a general dissatisfaction with the app being described as "trash," without pinpointing a reproducible issue. Thus, it does not meet the first criterion of describing a specific application interface or feature in a non-random manner.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
Reason: The scenario described in the user review mentions the issue arising after an **Android 12 update**, specifically affecting a phone's functionality or usability, rather than an issue related to a specific feature or widget within a particular app. This suggests a system-level issue rather than one that is reproducible through a particular app interface or functionality. Furthermore, the description doesn't focus on a feature of the app that could be directly tested, but rather on an OS update causing a malfunction. Therefore, the scenario is not tied to the behavior of the app itself but rather to an external factor (Android 12 update) that might impact the device as a whole. This means the issue is **cross-application** and not confined to a fixed app interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario mentioned, "Using Chrome as a mobile browser, experiencing smooth and fast performance even on slow internet," does not satisfy the criteria for the following reasons:

1. The scenario is not specific to a particular application page, widget, or feature. It describes a general experience with Chrome as a mobile browser and not a specific feature of an application within the browser.
   
2. The scenario is more about the performance of Chrome as a browser on slow internet, which does not directly improve the functions or user experience of an application developed by other developers. It is also not a request for an additional feature.

3. There is a cross-application element involved since it talks about the performance of a browser (Chrome) rather than a specific application. Additionally, the scenario is not limited to instances where an app is opened normally; it describes general browsing with Chrome.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not meet the first point because it compares the performance of Chrome to other browsers (Opera Mini and Firefox) in terms of freezing and buggy behavior, but does not describe a specific feature or interface within the Chrome app. It seems to be a general complaint about performance across different browsers rather than a specific issue with a fixed interface or feature in Chrome. Additionally, the issue described appears to be related to app performance across multiple browsers, which is not app-specific to Chrome alone.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**

**Reason:**

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario describes a situation where the user searches on Chrome while not signed in, and receives YouTube video recommendations based on that search, even though the YouTube account signed in is not theirs. However, the scenario is cross-application (involves both Chrome and YouTube). This violates the condition that the feature should not involve cross-application interaction. Additionally, it doesn't describe a specific interface or feature within either Chrome or YouTube, but rather a behavior that spans both apps. 

2. **Improvement to Functionality/User Experience**: The scenario could indicate an issue with user privacy or cross-app data synchronization, but it does not directly suggest an improvement to functionality or user experience in the traditional sense. It’s more of a behavioral issue that could be perceived as a flaw, especially in terms of privacy concerns, rather than a feature enhancement.

3. **Cross-Application**: This scenario involves two apps (Chrome and YouTube), and the behavior described spans both apps. The requirement is that the issue should not be cross-application, so this condition is violated.

Since the scenario violates the cross-application condition and doesn’t describe a clear, reproducible feature in one specific app, the answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described involves a cross-application process where actions taken on Amazon (searching for a product and adding it to the cart) are followed by actions on YouTube (looking up reviews). The change in product price on Amazon as a result of actions taken on YouTube implies external influences not controlled by the Amazon app itself. Therefore, the scenario is not contained within a single application, violating point 3. Additionally, the scenario involves the interaction between two different applications (Amazon and YouTube), which explicitly indicates a cross-application scenario.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario "It is not showing me how to update it" does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature of the application interface, which makes it difficult to reproduce. It broadly points to an update process without detailing the steps or interface elements involved, so it doesn't meet the criterion of being a "fixed interface of the application." Additionally, it's unclear which specific feature or function of the app is in question since "how to update" could relate to many different aspects depending on the context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario involves interoperability between two applications (Google Chrome and DoorDash), which violates point 3 that states the scenario cannot be cross-application. Additionally, the scenario is vague and does not specify a particular feature or page in the apps, which is required to determine if it is a reproducible issue per point 1. There's no clear indication that a specific, non-random interface or feature of DoorDash through Chrome encounters an issue, nor is there a suggestion for a new feature that doesn't already exist.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves cross-application behavior, where updating the Chrome app leads to malfunctions or restarts of other active applications. This suggests an issue that affects multiple apps rather than being isolated within a specific part of the Chrome app itself. Furthermore, the description does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the Chrome app that might trigger the problem, making it difficult to reproduce the scenario consistently. Additionally, the issue specified is not an enhancement to functionality or user experience within the app, but rather a technical malfunction affecting other apps.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the scenario provided, here's the analysis:

1. **Reproducibility of the Scenario**:
   - The issue described is with the Google Lens feature not performing as well as the original image search function and being frequently buggy.
   - Google Lens is a specific feature that is embedded within many Google-related applications, so it's generally a fixed interface and not something that appears randomly.
   - The scenario does not describe a requested feature addition, indicating that Google Lens is currently present in the app, aligning with the criteria for reproducibility.

2. **Nature of the Issue**:
   - The problem is related to the functionality of a feature (Google Lens) that impacts how well the app performs, therefore, it aligns with functional issues and enhancement of user experience. It does not pertain to content-related issues like inaccurate content or ad-related complaints.

3. **Cross-application Scenario**:
   - The issue does not suggest or imply that it spans across multiple applications. The problematic feature, Google Lens, is confined to the application in question where the issue is being observed.
   - The scenario occurs during the normal usage of the app, not when it's minimized, in the background, or in a floating window status, as suggested by the situation described.

Considering these points:
- The scenario meets all three specified criteria: it is reproducible, it is a functional improvement area, and it is not a cross-application problem.

Therefore, the output is:
 
YES
Reason: The problem is related to a specific feature (Google Lens) within the app, which can be consistently accessed and evaluated. It is a functional issue rather than a content-related one and is confined to the app, not spanning across multiple apps.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves a user wanting to opt out of AI-generated search results, indicating a feature request rather than a current feature issue. This suggests that the application does not currently have an opt-out option for AI search results, meaning not all the points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not describe a specific page or feature, but rather a general functionality related to language settings. It is not mentioned if the issue is occurring on a specific page of the application or with a particular widget/feature. Additionally, while the scenario is important for user experience, it is more related to a general functionality issue rather than specific application interface problems. Therefore, the first criterion is not fully met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario is not reproducible in the sense of a specific, fixed application page or feature. The user is describing a process (account recovery with verification) that may vary in implementation across different versions of the app or due to other factors (e.g., specific user accounts, security settings, etc.). The feature (account recovery process) is not a fixed interface and may change depending on the context or user account.  
2) The feature mentioned (difficulty in account verification and the user's request for a simpler verification method) is more about user frustration rather than a direct improvement to the app's core functionality. The request for a simpler method (e.g., captcha) is the user's suggestion, not something the app currently includes.  
3) The scenario seems to describe an account recovery process which is typically application-specific and doesn’t cross between apps. However, as the scenario is tied to a process (account recovery), it does not seem to describe a standalone or fixed feature of the app but rather a situation where the process failed or was difficult to navigate.  

Thus, the scenario does not meet all three points required for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario described ("Google and Chrome are not working and show 'you are offline' despite Play Store and YouTube working fine") does not refer to a specific application feature or interface within the app in question. It sounds more like a network issue affecting multiple apps (Google, Chrome), which may not be reproducible in a consistent or fixed manner within a specific app or interface.

2. **Feature improvement**: The scenario is related to a network connectivity issue (Google and Chrome apps showing offline errors), which could be a general system or connectivity problem, not a feature of the app itself. It doesn’t describe a feature of the app that would improve the user experience or functionality; it’s an external issue involving the network, not an app feature.

3. **Cross-application issue**: This is a cross-application issue, as it involves the behavior of Google, Chrome, Play Store, and YouTube across different apps, which means the problem is not isolated to a single app or feature.

Thus, the scenario does not meet the criteria for reproducibility, relevance to the app's features, or being app-specific.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario describes a **request for an additional feature** (support for extensions in Android's Chrome browser), which is a suggestion rather than an issue with the app's current functionality. The scenario does not describe a problem with the current version or interface of the app; rather, it outlines a feature that the user wants to be added. This means the scenario does not meet the condition of being a **reproducible issue** with a specific feature of the app.
   
2. The scenario is **content-related** in the sense that it involves a feature request and not a bug or functional issue (such as "not working" or "crashing"), which goes against the requirement for improving app functionality rather than just content-related problems.

3. The scenario is **cross-application** because it refers to a feature of the Android operating system (Chrome browser) and not an issue within a specific app's environment. It doesn't happen within the app itself, but rather in a broader context involving Chrome on Android.  

Therefore, the scenario does not meet the criteria outlined, leading to the answer "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves the app freezing or showing a blank screen on startup, which is a stochastic issue rather than one tied to a specific interface or feature within the app. Therefore, it does not meet the first criterion. The problem does not specify a particular application page or fixed interface and appears randomly, making it difficult to consistently reproduce. Additionally, while addressing this issue could certainly improve user experience, the basis for NO rests on the failure to meet the first point related to reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature that leads to the slowdown; hence, it lacks specificity for reproducibility. Additionally, the problem described is a general performance issue rather than a specific feature or function that could directly enhance user experience. Moreover, the scenario could potentially affect the entire phone beyond the app itself, implying a cross-application effect. Therefore, it does not meet all three points.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario, let's evaluate it against the three points:

1. **Is the scenario reproducible?**
   - The scenario describes turning off the "AI overview feature" in the Chrome app and not being able to find a way to do so. Firstly, as of the last available information, Chrome does not have a feature explicitly named "AI overview feature." This indicates that this feature may not exist or is not named as such, which suggests that it might be a misunderstanding by the user. Therefore, this specific scenario may not be reproducible due to a lack of clarity regarding what the "AI overview feature" precisely refers to.

2. **Is the issue content-related?**
   - The scenario is not about content issues such as "inaccurate content" or "ads." It is about a user interface feature (or lack thereof) and the user's inability to find a setting or option. This point is satisfied.

3. **Is the scenario cross-application or related to the app's status?**
   - The scenario appears to be specific to the Chrome app and does not involve interaction with another application. There is no mention of the scenario occurring due to the app being in a small window, background, or floating status. It is assumed to occur when the app is used normally, which satisfies this point.

In summary, while points 2 and 3 are met, the first point is not satisfied because the mentioned feature does not appear to be an existing, identifiable, or reproducible feature known in the Chrome app.

Output:

```
NO
Reason: The scenario is not reproducible due to the lack of clarity regarding the existence of the "AI overview feature" in the Chrome app.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described—"When the user opens the Chrome app on their mobile phone, it automatically closes"—appears to be a random occurrence rather than a specific, repeatable issue tied to a particular page, widget, or feature in the app. The scenario does not provide enough details to confirm if the issue is fixed to one specific part of the app or happens under specific conditions. Additionally, there is no indication that this is a deliberate feature or function of the app. It sounds more like a technical problem, possibly involving the app's stability or compatibility, rather than a design feature that could enhance user experience. Furthermore, the issue could be related to device or configuration settings, so it could potentially be cross-application or device-specific. Therefore, it doesn't meet all the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user comment is not reproducible in a fixed and predictable manner because it mentions that the mobile browser "does not display many mobile sites correctly and crashes frequently." This indicates that the issue is not tied to a specific application page or widget but rather to a broader, potentially random behavior when interacting with various mobile sites. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being reproducible in a fixed interface and fails the first point.

Reason: The scenario described, "Attempt to block sharing ('Sharon') of the device," seems to suggest a feature that might not exist within the app. If "block sharing" is not an existing feature of the application, then it would fall under a feature suggested by the user for addition. This indicates that the app does not currently include this feature. Hence, it does not meet the first point outlined in the criteria.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario of attempting to block all cookies on every app is not reproducible within a specific application since it involves a cross-application feature. The scenario appears to concern a system-wide or privacy-related feature that is generally managed at the operating system level or through browser settings, rather than being specific to a single app or an interface fixed within a single app. Additionally, cookie management is a privacy control feature, which might involve settings outside the application's specific features. Therefore, the scenario does not meet the criteria of being specific to a single fixed app interface and not being cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The user is forced to use the new app version after the update, which overrides their preference for manual updates and prevents them from reverting to an earlier version or uninstalling the update.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. Is the scenario reproducible?  
   - The scenario involves the app forcing an update and preventing reversion, which may relate to an app's general settings or update mechanism but does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the app's interface. Thus, this does not guarantee a reproducible UI/UX interface scenario.  

2. Feature Description:  
   - The issue primarily pertains to user control over app updates and doesn’t directly relate to enhancing a functional or experiential aspect of the app like navigation, user interface, etc. Instead, it involves app update policy, which is more of an administrative feature rather than a functionality enhancement or user experience improvement.  
  
3. Cross-Application Scenario:  
   - While the scenario pertains to app updates, it does not inherently involve actions across multiple applications. Still, the issue arises due to application settings controlled at the system level (like update policies), which could cause interaction across system settings, thereby potentially making this consideration adjacent.  

Overall, the scenario does not precisely meet the criteria laid out for all three points; hence, the output is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described is about the app's interface being "horrible," "awkward," and "inelegant," which does not provide specific details about a particular page, widget, or feature of the application. Without specific details, it is difficult to determine if the scenario is reproducible or related to a fixed part of the interface. Additionally, the issues mentioned are related to user interface design rather than functional enhancements or new features that could improve user experience. Therefore, the scenario does not clearly meet the criteria outlined in the problem statement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario mentions an issue with resetting to a manual update preference, which is specific and likely tied to a fixed interface or setting within the app. However, without more detailed information about the exact steps to reproduce or the exact page/widget, it is unclear if this is a reproducible scenario under specific conditions.

2. The inability to reset to a manual update preference is a functional issue that affects the user experience as it pertains to application settings, not content-related issues like advertisements.

3. The scenario description does not indicate that the issue occurs across applications or in states such as small window, background, or floating status. The issue seems to arise within the normal operation of the app.

Therefore, based on the lack of specific detail to confirm reproducibility, the answer is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The PC version of Chrome crashes or closes on its own every few minutes.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario provided ("The PC version of Chrome crashes or closes on its own every few minutes") does not specify a fixed interface of the application, such as a specific application page or widget/feature. The crashing issue appears to be random and not tied to any specific part of the application, making it difficult to reproduce consistently as it does not describe a reproducible scenario that developers can easily isolate and address.

2. The issue described is related to the stability and performance of the application (i.e., crashing), which is indeed a functional problem that can impact user experience. Therefore, this aspect would be helpful in enhancing application functions and improving user satisfaction if resolved.

3. Since the scenario is referring to the PC version of Chrome, it is not an issue with a mobile app. Therefore, this would be a cross-application issue if considered in the context of reproducing problems for mobile applications, which is not applicable here. 

Ultimately, due to the lack of specificity and the cross-application nature, the scenario does not meet all the necessary points for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described does not meet all three criteria for reproducibility. The statement "Chrome app crashes intermittently while using it" is too vague and lacks specific details about which part of the app or which features trigger the crash. The lack of specific information about an application page or feature means it cannot be considered a fixed, reproducible issue. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the issue is content-related or a bug. Additionally, the scenario could be cross-application if it is related to system-level crashes that affect other apps as well.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario involves updating an app (Chrome) via an external platform (Google Play Store). This is a cross-application issue as it involves interactions between two different applications, which doesn't meet the third criteria. Additionally, the problem described does not relate to any specific application page or feature within the Chrome app itself but rather the update process via the Play Store.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**: The scenario mentions that the update button is not showing up in the Google Play Store, but it does not specify if this occurs within the app itself (Chrome app) or when accessing the Play Store through a web or Play Store app. The context is ambiguous and lacks clarity on the page or widget where this issue happens. Therefore, it cannot be considered a fixed interface issue for the Chrome app.

2. **Helpfulness of Feature**: The issue of the update button not showing up in the Play Store is more related to the functioning of the Google Play Store, not the core function of the Chrome app itself. It's a potential store-related issue, not a feature directly impacting the Chrome app's core functionality or user experience.

3. **Cross-application Issue**: The problem likely occurs in the Google Play Store app (which is a separate app from Chrome), making it a cross-application issue. This contradicts the requirement for it to be specific to the Chrome app's normal interface. 

Thus, the scenario does not meet the required criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The provided scenario does not describe a specific feature, page, or interface in the app. The user only provides an overall evaluation of the app, stating it is "useful for everyone in every place or location," but this is not a detailed description of a feature or a reproducible scenario. It does not meet the criteria of describing a fixed application feature or interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario mentioned is not specific to a particular page, widget, or feature within the Chrome application. Instead, it describes a general issue of Chrome showing a "not responding" message, which could occur randomly rather than at a fixed interface. This makes it challenging to consistently reproduce the scenario.  
2. While addressing the "Chrome not responding" issue could enhance user experience, this is a broad performance-related concern, not related to a functional or content-specific feature.  
3. The scenario relates solely to the Chrome app and does not suggest any cross-application interaction. Nevertheless, the main issue is the lack of specificity and predictable conditions under which the problem occurs, making it difficult to reproduce systematically.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the Chrome app that consistently reproduces the issue. It simply mentions "excessive memory usage," which can occur under various circumstances and is not tied to a fixed interface or feature.  

2. While managing memory usage can enhance user experience, this scenario is more about performance optimization rather than a functional feature that can be directly adjusted or improved upon within the application's interface.  

3. The scenario might involve interaction with system-level functions (e.g., app updates) beyond just the Chrome app's functionality. The issue seems linked to external factors (app updates) interacting with Chrome's performance rather than something occurring solely within the Chrome app when opened normally.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "Chrome's high memory usage causes other apps to malfunction" involves cross-application behavior, as it describes an issue affecting multiple applications, not just Chrome. This scenario does not pertain to a specific page, widget, or feature within Chrome itself but refers to its broader impact on the device's functioning. Additionally, the scenario goes beyond the interface of the Chrome application and does not exclusively occur when the app is started normally; the problem is related to how Chrome interacts with system resources while other apps are running. Thus, it does not meet the requirement of being limited to the described application without cross-application influence.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario "The help page for troubleshooting is not helpful" does not meet all three points. While it does describe a specific application page (the help page), it is too vague to be a reproducible scenario as it does not specify what makes the page unhelpful nor does it point to a fixed interface issue. The second point concerning improving application functions is also not fully met, as it mentions a content issue (help page content) rather than a functional one. Finally, while the scenario does not necessarily imply cross-application behavior, it lacks sufficient details to guide specific improvements or actions by developers.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described is too vague to be considered fully reproducible. It does not specify a particular feature, page, or widget within Google Chrome that is causing the problem. Without this specific information, it's challenging to reproduce the issue consistently. Moreover, while app crashes can indeed impact functionality and user experience, they are not related to content issues, so the second point is satisfied. However, as the scenario does not detail the exact trigger or context of the crash, it fails to fully meet the criteria for a reproducible problem scenario as outlined in point 1. The third point is met as it appears the issue is related specifically to Google Chrome and occurs after a normal start, not in cross-application or minimized states.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario is potentially reproducible because it's a common issue that users might face with app updates. However, the issue described does not pertain to a specific application page, widget, or feature within Chrome itself. It relates more to the interaction between the app and the app store or the installation process. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria that the scenario must be a fixed interface of the application.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue described is not related to a specific feature within the app that could be improved but rather to a maintenance issue related to updates. While resolving this issue can enhance the user experience by ensuring users have the latest features and security updates, it does not relate to adding or improving a feature within the app's interface or functionality.

3. **Cross-Application Scenario**: The problem described seems to involve not just the Chrome app, but also the system’s app store since updating typically uses the store's services. This makes it cross-application, disqualifying the scenario under the given criteria.

Therefore, the combined assessment of these criteria leads to the conclusion that this scenario does not satisfy all the conditions set forth in the task.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a crash upon opening the app that results in a white screen, but it does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature being accessed. While this suggests a start-up process issue, the lack of specificity makes it challenging to determine if the issue is reproducible with consistent steps, as crashes can sometimes be influenced by varied factors or occur randomly.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue of the app crashing with a white screen can indeed affect user experience by preventing access to the app. However, the description does not include information about any specific features or functions that could be directly improved, but rather a fundamental stability issue which is more technical rather than a functional feature that enhances user experience.

3. **Cross-Application Verification**: The comment does not mention behavior that varies based on app states (like being in a small window, background, or pop-up status) or interactions with other applications, so this criterion is met. However, failure in the other two criteria already results in a 'NO' conclusion.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario "Brightness reduces on its own within the app" does not specify a particular application page or feature. It describes a behavior that could occur universally across the application, but the lack of specifics makes it difficult to reproduce consistently. There is no indication that the issue is limited to a fixed interface rather than being random.

2. While adjusting brightness automatically can affect user experience, the scenario does not provide enough context to determine if it's intended behavior or a bug. Without clear ties to functionality enhancement, it is hard to assess this against content-related issues.

3. The scenario can potentially overlap with cross-application settings. Automatic brightness adjustments could be due to device settings outside of the app, rather than being isolated to the app itself. Thus, it is not clearly an in-app only issue.

Consequently, the lack of specificity and clear isolation within the app context leads to not meeting the outlined points for reproducibility and relevance.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The internet browser feature in Chrome is not working.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario does not describe a specific application page, widget, or a fixed interface. It simply mentions that the "internet browser feature in Chrome is not working," which is vague and does not pinpoint a particular feature, widget, or page. The problem could be related to multiple areas of the app (e.g., browser settings, network connectivity, or the browser’s overall functionality).
2. The issue described does not seem to be about improving the app’s functions or user experience. The problem appears to be related to the core functionality of the app (the browser feature not working), which could be more of a technical issue rather than a design improvement.
3. The scenario might be cross-application because the issue could be related to the mobile device's network or operating system, affecting Chrome as a browser app but not necessarily pointing directly to an issue within the app itself. 

Thus, the scenario does not fully meet the criteria to be reproducible in a controlled environment.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:User has dropped multiple emails regarding these issues.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To evaluate if the scenario meets all three points, let's analyze each aspect:

1. **Reproducibility:** 
   - The user has mentioned "dropped multiple emails regarding these issues," but there is no specific mention of an application page or feature that leads to these issues. Without detailed information on which specific part of the app is problematic, it's unclear if this is tied to a fixed interface. Therefore, the scenario's reproducibility is questionable.

2. **Feature Improvement and User Experience:** 
   - The comment does not specify what issues were raised in the emails, so we can't assess if they pertain to enhancing application functionality or user experience. If they are related to content issues or ad-related concerns, they would not count.

3. **Cross-Application Nature:** 
   - The issue's description is too vague to determine whether it could be related to interactions with other applications. However, since the user refers to issues within the app, we will assume they are app-specific unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the lack of specificity, particularly regarding reproducibility and feature improvement, it is difficult to conclude that all points are met.

**Output:** NO  
**Reason:** The scenario lacks specificity about the application interface or feature, making reproducibility evaluation difficult. Additionally, without details, it's unclear if it pertains to app functionality enhancement or user experience improvement issues.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The app is being hacked multiple times.  Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario of "the app being hacked multiple times" does not describe a specific application page, widget, or feature. It is not a fixed interface of the application and does not pertain to a reproducible app functionality or interface issue. Instead, it suggests a security concern that is more related to app vulnerabilities, which does not fulfill the criteria of being a specific, reproducible feature or scenario within the app. Additionally, this issue might involve factors outside of the app itself, such as user security practices or external hacking attempts, which are not within the scope of a typical app feature or experience improvement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:User requests suggestions for fixing the issue.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To determine if the scenario described in the user comment meets all the criteria outlined and to provide an appropriate response, let's evaluate each condition:

1. **Reproducible Scenario:** The scenario must describe a specific application page, widget, or feature that is a fixed part of the application interface and does not appear randomly. Additionally, it should not involve features that the user is suggesting to be added.
   
   - If the scenario describes a known application page or feature that can be accessed consistently by following set steps within the app, it is considered reproducible.

2. **Feature Improvement and User Experience:** The feature described in the scenario should contribute to improving the application's functions and enhancing the user experience. It should not pertain to content-related issues such as inaccurate content or issues with advertisements.

   - If the scenario outlines a technical or usability issue that, when addressed, would enhance the app's functionality or user experience, it meets this criterion.

3. **Not Cross-Application and Normal App State:** The scenario must occur when the app is started normally and not when the app is in a minimized, background, or floating state. It also must pertain to issues within the app itself, not those that are cross-application.

   - If the scenario describes an issue that occurs during normal use of the app, it meets this condition.

Based on these points, if the scenario described in the comment fulfills all three conditions, we output "YES." If any condition is not met, we output "NO" and specify which condition(s) failed.

Since the scenario specifics from the user comment are not provided here, let’s hypothetically address these points:

1. **Reproducibility:** Assume the user describes a consistent issue occurring on a specific page or with a specific feature, and no new feature requests are included.

2. **User Experience Improvement:** Assume the issue described affects usability or functionality, not content issues.

3. **Normal App State:** Assume the scenario occurs during standard app use and pertains solely to the app in question.

If all assumptions align with these conditions, the scenario satisfies the criteria.

Now providing a hypothetical conclusion:

**YES**
Reason: The scenario describes a specific, reproducible issue affecting a known feature in the application, is related to improving user experience, and occurs in normal app usage without involving other applications or minimized states.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described ("The Google site crashes after the recent update") is too vague to determine if it is reproducible. It does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature, nor does it mention a fixed interface. It simply describes a crash after an update, which could be caused by a variety of non-specific and variable factors. Additionally, the issue could involve cross-application interactions if the comment refers to a crash when interacting with content from the Google site within the app. Furthermore, there is no indication that reproducing this scenario would contribute to improving app functions or enhancing the user experience since crashes could be due to reasons unrelated to core app functionality or user interface improvements.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described seems to involve an issue with opening other websites or apps from the homescreen when they require Google Chrome. However, this seems to be a system-level issue with the device's ability to link to external applications and not a specific fixed interface of a single app. It may involve multiple applications (cross-application) which also goes against the criteria provided. Since it isn't tied to a specific app's page or feature and involves external factors related to Chrome or system settings, it does not meet the requirement of being a scenario occurring within a singular application. Additionally, it's not focused on improving the core functionality of the indicated application itself, but rather the interaction with other apps, which could involve OS or browser-level settings outside single app control.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario involves cross-application interaction, as it affects the process of opening related apps or websites and prompts to use Google Chrome, which is an external application. This violates point 3, as the scenario cannot be cross-application. Additionally, the scenario does not specify if it concerns a specific application page or widget/feature within a single app, which makes it unclear whether it is a fixed interface or could occur randomly, impacting point 1.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Open the Google app; the app closes automatically after 2 seconds and does not stay open.  

Explanation: The user describes a continuous issue where they open the Google app, and it closes within 2 seconds. This involves a specific feature of the app and can be reproduced as described. Other parts of the comment (e.g., date reference or evaluation) do not describe specific app functionality.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly?

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is reproducible as it describes a specific, consistent behavior of the Google app closing automatically after 2 seconds when opened. This behavior is not dependent on any random interface and does not involve features suggested for addition.  
2. This scenario involves functionality issues with the app that, once resolved, would enhance the user experience by allowing them to use the app as intended. It does not involve content-related issues like ads.  
3. The issue is specific to the Google app starting in a normal manner and does not involve interactions with other applications or occur in a miniaturized or background state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves a cross-application issue, as it mentions Google Search opening Chrome and displaying a blank page or a strobe effect. Since it involves interaction between multiple applications (Google Search and Chrome), it does not meet the requirement of being a non-cross-application scenario. Furthermore, the description does not specify that the issue occurs on a fixed interface within the app itself, which adds another layer of uncertainty regarding reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario mentions a problem related to pages opening differently in Firefox and Chrome, which implies it may concern a web application rather than a mobile app. Additionally, the scenario does not specify a particular page or feature within a specific mobile app, and it involves cross-application behavior between different browsers. Consequently, it does not meet all three points outlined:
1. The scenario is not restricted to a specific application page or widget of a mobile app.
2. The discrepancy between browser behavior is more technical and may not directly enhance the user experience in the context of a single mobile app.
3. The scenario involves cross-application behavior between Firefox and Chrome rather than staying within a single mobile app context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario involves using Google Chrome to search for information, which is a cross-application action. It does not focus on a specific application page or widget within a single app, and the scenario involves content retrieval through a browser rather than enhancing the app's specific functionalities. Additionally, the scenario does not specify a unique feature that should be reproduced within a particular mobile app itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. Reproducibility: The scenario described involves using Chrome for web searching, which does not tie to a specific or fixed interface of Chrome. The search results being irrelevant or in a different language could be influenced by various factors such as search query, user settings, region-specific Google behavior, cache/cookies, and network issues. Therefore, this scenario may not be consistently reproducible as it’s not a fixed interface issue.

2. Feature Improvement: The scenario concerns search results not being relevant or being in a different language, which points to a content-related issue rather than a functional issue within the application itself. While it can affect user experience, it does not suggest a feature or functionality that can be improved within the Chrome app itself but could be more about search algorithms or personalized settings.

3. Cross-application Scenario: Since the issue arises in Chrome but involves content retrieved from the web, it cannot be isolated to just the application of Chrome itself. The results depend on Google's back-end systems interacting with Chrome for the search query. Thus, it’s not strictly a single-application scenario as per the criteria.

Overall, given the content-centered nature and cross-application aspects of the scenario, and its potential non-reproducibility due to variable external factors, the answer is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario description lacks specificity regarding the exact application page or widget/feature being used. It mentions sending feedback through Chrome, which suggests the app integrates with a browser or web view, but it's not clear if this is a consistent feature across all uses of the app. Therefore, it is not certain if the scenario describes a fixed interface.  
2. While improving search result relevance is beneficial for user experience, the issue described relates to the perceived ineffectiveness of feedback in impacting the search results rather than a specific app feature malfunctioning.  
3. The scenario involves cross-application interaction as it mentions sending feedback through Chrome, which is a different application, violating the criteria of scenario occurrence strictly within the app itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue with updating the app where a "no storage space available" error occurs despite having sufficient storage space, which appears to be an anomaly rather than a fixed interface or specific feature of the application. It likely involves the device's operating system or app store behavior rather than the application itself. Therefore, it does not strictly adhere to a specific application page or widget as required by point 1. Additionally, this scenario involves interactions that may not necessarily be reproducible solely within the app environment, which further undermines point 3.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO

Reason: The scenario described does not provide specific details about a particular application page, widget, or feature that is reproducible within a fixed interface of the application. The issue of "unnecessary websites appearing" suggests an unexpected behavior or possibly external interference, rather than a specific app feature or page. Additionally, the problem seems to relate to content-related issues rather than a functional feature of the application itself. Since there is no clear description of a specific feature or interface to test, the scenario does not meet the criteria for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The unwanted websites keep popping up on the user's homescreen, making it difficult for their mobile to function properly.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature. It describes a general issue of unwanted websites appearing on the user's homescreen, which suggests a problem possibly related to adware, malware, or device settings rather than a specific feature of the app.  
2. The issue described is related to unwanted content (unwanted websites popping up), which falls under a content-related issue that might not necessarily be addressed by improving application functions and enhancing user experience.  
3. The scenario does not provide information on whether it occurs within a specific app or cross-application environment, which makes it difficult to determine if it is limited to the normal operation of a single app or if it occurs when multiple applications are involved.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario of "Fast browsing within the app" is not specific to a certain application page, feature, or widget that can be distinctly identified and tested by developers. It is a general user experience feedback rather than a specific, reproducible scenario. Additionally, it does not describe a fixed interface or feature that is consistently present and does not suggest a specific issue or bug that could be directly addressed. It is more likely a user suggestion for improvement rather than a scenario that can be directly reproduced and tested.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Fast browsing using the app for external (out of app) browsing.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described, "Fast browsing using the app for external (out of app) browsing," is not specific enough to determine if it is reproducible. It lacks details regarding a specific application page or widget/feature that consistently appears when using the app. Additionally, this scenario might imply a user suggestion for improvement rather than a current feature, meaning it might not exist in the app. The description does not provide sufficient clarity to ensure that all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Utilize the web page zoom feature after it has been reinstated.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described mentions utilizing the "web page zoom feature after it has been reinstated." This suggests a feature that may not currently exist in the app, as it implies reinstatement or addition, which aligns with point 1's criteria for user-suggested features. Additionally, there is no specific information about the application page where this feature should be used, which would be required for reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
**Reason:**  
1. The scenario describes applying a "dark theme to web pages." This suggests a feature request rather than an existing feature in the app. If the feature is not already implemented in the app, the scenario cannot be reproduced.  
2. While the feature could improve user experience, it appears to be a user-suggested addition rather than an issue with the current functionality.  
3. The scenario does not provide sufficient detail about a specific interface or page within the app, making it unclear if this issue is tied to a fixed interface or appears randomly.  

Since the first criterion is not met, the output is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The browser crashes almost daily on the Pixel 8 device.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user comment does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature that consistently causes the browser to crash. The issue appears to occur randomly without a clear set of steps to replicate it, making it difficult to guarantee reproducibility. Additionally, the scenario describes a technical performance issue (crashing) rather than a functional feature, which limits the ability to directly influence application function improvement or user experience enhancement within the scope defined.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Running other apps that interfere with Chrome, especially "dodge apps," which may cause issues with its performance.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario described involves running other apps that interfere with Chrome. This inherently makes it a cross-application issue since it involves interactions between Chrome and other applications (referred to as "dodge apps"). It is not limited to a specific application page or widget within a single app.

2. While the issue may relate to performance, which could impact user experience, the scenario is not exclusively about a feature within Chrome that can be improved without considering other apps. It's about interaction with external apps, which is out of the scope of a single app's feature improvement.

3. The scenario involves issues that occur due to other apps, not due to the state (small window, background, etc.) of Chrome itself. However, these issues are not constrained to a scenario where they arise strictly from Chrome's front-end operations alone but from interaction with other running apps.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Software from other search engines obscuring Chrome's functionality, requiring deletion to resolve the problem.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario does not describe a specific page, widget, or feature of the app. It mentions "software from other search engines obscuring Chrome's functionality," which implies an external app or third-party software interaction, not an issue confined to the app itself. This makes it less likely to be a fixed interface issue of the app.
2. **Feature improvement**: The issue described is related to interference from external software (other search engines), not a core feature or functionality of the app itself. It doesn't seem to be something the app itself can directly resolve through its own features, hence it doesn't fit into improving the app's functionality or user experience within the app.
3. **Cross-application issue**: The problem involves external software impacting Chrome, which makes it a cross-application issue. It’s not confined to the app being reviewed, thus violating the third condition that the issue should not be cross-application.

Therefore, the scenario does not meet all three points and is not reproducible as described.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Closing all tabs causes the Chrome application to automatically shut down.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a specific application behavior (closing all tabs causes the Chrome app to shut down) and refers to a fixed feature (tabs management) of the Chrome application, which should be consistently reproducible if it occurs. However, without testing in various environments and configurations, it cannot be definitively confirmed as reproducible purely from the given description.

2. **Improvement Potential**: The scenario highlights a potential usability issue. If closing all tabs unintentionally causes the Chrome app to shut down, it may indicate a bug or a design flaw that could be addressed to improve user experience. This aligns with the improving application function criterion.

3. **Single-Application**: The described issue pertains specifically to the Chrome application and does not involve cross-application interactions, meeting the single-application requirement.

Despite meeting criteria 2 and 3, due to the potential variability and dependency on specific conditions for the issue to occur, there's ambiguity about the reproducibility aspect, leading to a 'NO' judgement for point 1.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The setting "Turn Off Secure DNS" in Chrome version 93 has no effect, potentially indicating a bug or broken feature.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES

Reason:
1. The scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific setting option ("Turn Off Secure DNS") in a specific version of the Chrome app (version 93). This setting is a fixed feature of the Chrome browser and is not random or suggested for addition by the user, as Secure DNS is an existing feature in Chrome.
   
2. The feature described relates to a functional issue (the setting not having an effect), which is relevant for improving the app's functionality and enhancing user experience. It is not a content-related issue like ads or inaccurate content.

3. The issue is specific to the Chrome app and does not require interaction with other applications, nor is it related to the app running in a small window, background, or popup/floating status. The problem occurs when the app is started and used normally.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a general behavior of the DNS function in Chrome version 77 and its Webview, which is not a specific application page, widget, or fixed interface feature. Therefore, it does not meet point 1. Additionally, the scenario does not specify a feature that can be directly associated with improving user experience within the app itself, as it pertains more to network behavior rather than a feature enhancement within an application. It is also a cross-application scenario because it involves the interaction between Chrome/Webview and an Android firewall, which does not fulfill point 3.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:When opening the app, it freezes on a blank grey page and doesn't progress until the app is completely closed and reopened.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario and criteria, let's evaluate the points:

1. **Reproducibility:** The scenario describes that the app freezes on a blank grey page upon opening. This seems to be related to the app's launch process, which is a specific and fixed interface of an application. It is not described as a random occurrence, and it doesn’t involve user-suggested features. Thus, this part seems to be met.

2. **Improvement of Application Functions:** The issue of the app freezing on a blank grey page is directly related to the app's functionality and user experience. It is not a content-related issue and does not involve ads. Therefore, addressing this problem could improve the app's performance and user satisfaction. This point is also met.

3. **Cross-application Occurrence:** The scenario specifically mentions that it occurs in a normal app start situation, implying that it does not happen when the app is in a small window, background, or popping up/floating status. Thus, it appears to be a problem within this specific app when started normally, and not a cross-application issue. This point is also met.

Given that all three points are satisfied, the output should be:

YES

Reason: The scenario describes a reproducible issue with a specific app interface, it relates to improving app functionality and user experience, and it doesn't occur in cross-application contexts or windowed/background modes.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described ("The group tabs won't show up when zooming out or touching down") does not provide specific information about an application page or a fixed interface of the application. It lacks detail about when or where exactly within the app these group tabs are supposed to appear, indicating that it might not be a universally reproducible issue across all users or app interfaces. Additionally, while it may indicate a potential user experience improvement, the lack of specificity makes it difficult to ascertain if it genuinely enhances functionality.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves the app updating itself despite the user turning off auto-update. While this issue relates to functionality, it typically involves settings or actions external to the app itself, such as device or app store settings, rather than a specific page or feature within the app. Therefore, it may not be directly reproducible or specific to the interface of the application. Additionally, this issue might relate to how the app interacts with the operating system or app store settings and not a feature to be improved directly within the app itself. This scenario also might involve cross-application behavior regarding how system updates are handled.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario does not describe a specific application page, widget, or feature and is too vague to determine whether it is a fixed interface of the application. It simply states that the app crashes for no apparent reason, which does not provide enough detail to reproduce the issue consistently. It also fails to specify the conditions or context under which the crashes occur, making it impossible to determine if it’s related to a specific aspect of the app that can be addressed. Additionally, it doesn’t indicate whether the app behavior is specific to one app or across multiple apps.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: 
1. The scenario is reproducible as it describes a fixed interface issue with the tabs for saved open pages showing only about 10 letters of the page name. This is a specific feature and is not suggested for addition, indicating the feature is currently present in the app.
2. The issue is related to the app's functionality in displaying tab names and can significantly enhance user experience if improved, as it relates to the interface design rather than content-related issues.
3. The scenario is specific to the application in question and does not involve cross-application behavior. It describes an issue that occurs when the app is used normally, not influenced by screen size or background activity.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Without confirmation that this issue is fixed and occurs every time, it cannot be definitively judged as reproducible.  
   
2. **Feature Description**: The issue described relates to a lack of visual elements (pictures) on tabs, which affects usability and user experience. While this is a functional issue (affecting navigation), it's not clear whether this was intended behavior or an actual bug. There's a possibility it could be a content display issue or a visual rendering problem, which seems to fall under a usability issue rather than a missing feature. Therefore, this point might be argued as borderline.  
  
3. **Cross-application**: The scenario seems specific to a single app, as it describes an issue with tabs, a feature likely unique to the app's UI. However, without more context, it's unclear if this issue occurs only in one app or across different apps.

Therefore, the scenario is not fully clear on reproducibility, and could be more specific to an app’s display or rendering problems rather than a feature issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Loss of text in search results and websites on Moto G54 with Android 13, which can temporarily be resolved by clearing cache, disabling/enabling, or forcing stop.
Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) **Reproducibility**: The scenario involves a problem that happens on search results and websites, but does not specify a particular application or page within the app, or a consistent interface. It seems to describe a more generalized issue, which could occur intermittently or based on specific conditions (e.g., device configuration, app cache state, etc.). Therefore, it does not seem like a reproducible, fixed issue based on the description.  
2) **Improvement of User Experience**: The described issue is related to a technical problem (text loss in search results), which impacts user experience, but the scenario focuses on a bug that causes errors rather than a feature that enhances functionality.  
3) **Cross-application**: This issue might not be app-specific, as it mentions "websites" in addition to the app’s search results. The problem might be linked to interactions between the app and websites, which makes it more likely to be cross-application, especially if the web content is rendered within the app.  

Therefore, the scenario does not fully meet the requirements for being a reproducible, non-cross-application issue that improves app functionality.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Some images appear normally while others do not.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described, "some images appear normally while others do not," does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature. It seems to be a general display issue rather than being tied to a fixed interface or specific part of the app. Additionally, while the issue may affect the user experience, it doesn't provide clear guidance on a specific app feature or interface to be improved. Therefore, the first point is not met, and the second point is not clearly addressed as it's not specifically tied to functional enhancement but rather a potential bug or performance issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Reverting back to a previous version of the app resolves the issue of text loss and image display inconsistencies.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves reverting to a previous version to resolve issues, which suggests that the problem may not be tied to a specific application page or feature and might not be consistently reproducible in the current version. Moreover, the text loss and image display inconsistencies could potentially result from random or version-specific glitches rather than a fixed app interface. Additionally, while addressing image and text display issues can be crucial for enhancing user experience, the scenario's focus on reverting versions leans towards a version-specific issue rather than an inherent feature improvement. Thus, not all criteria are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Perform a web search on Chrome and receive irrelevant search results, with the top 10 results appearing in languages other than the search query. Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility:** The scenario of receiving irrelevant search results with the top 10 results in languages other than the search query may be caused by multiple factors such as search engine algorithm behavior, user settings, or network issues, and is not necessarily a fixed interface or feature of the Chrome app. This does not meet the criteria for a specific application page or feature with a fixed interface.  
2. **Content-Related Issue:** The issue described is primarily a content-related issue ("irrelevant search results" and language mismatches), which falls under "inaccurate content," and not a feature-related issue that would directly improve app functionality or user experience.  
3. **Cross-Application:** The scenario involves a web search, which can be influenced by factors outside the application itself, such as how search engines process queries. This indicates the possibility of cross-application interaction, though the scenario does not clearly occur due to the app functioning in the background or in a non-full-screen mode.  

Since it does not fully satisfy point 1 and fails point 2, the output is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves sending feedback through Chrome and not seeing improvements in search result relevance. This scenario does not describe a specific application page or a specific widget/feature of the Chrome application itself; instead, it is about user feedback and the resulting change (or lack thereof) in search relevance, which is not a fixed interface or inherent feature of an application. Furthermore, this is a content-related issue as it concerns the accuracy and relevance of search results, rather than a specific functional feature related to the Chrome app. Additionally, since the problem involves both Chrome and a search functionality presumably external to it (e.g., a search engine), the issue could be cross-application, involving how feedback impacts external search algorithms, not just Chrome itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To evaluate whether the scenario meets all three points, let's analyze each criteria:

1. **Is the scenario reproducible?**  
   The scenario describes issues with two features: the "tabs feature" and the "new folder system". These are specific application features that are likely part of the fixed interface of the app, assuming the app in question has these features and hasn't removed them since the user's comment. The scenario doesn't suggest adding these features, implying they already exist in the app.

2. **Is the feature helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience?**  
   Yes, addressing issues with the tabs feature and the folder system could enhance navigation and organization within the app. These are functional aspects rather than content-related issues. Improving these features could directly enhance user experience by making the app more intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Is the scenario cross-application or occurring only when the app is in a minimized, background, or floating state?**  
   The scenario is focused on the app's internal features (tabs and folder system) and not cross-application. It specifies issues that occur within the normal use of the app, implying it occurs when the app is started and used normally, not in a minimized or background state.

Given this analysis, the scenario meets all three points.

**YES**
Reason: The scenario is reproducible with fixed features (tabs and folder system) within the app, it relates to improving app functionality and user experience, and it does not involve cross-application issues or occur in minimized/background status.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Tap and hold a URL link on a page and encounter a pop-up window change that is disliked.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not specify a particular application page or a fixed interface; it merely describes a general interaction with a URL link. Additionally, there is no indication that this pop-up window change is a part of a fixed application feature—it could be something affected by other application-specific or device-specific behaviors. Therefore, the scenario isn't specific enough to determine it as reproducible under controlled conditions.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario and criteria, let's analyze each point:

1. **Reproducibility of the Scenario**: 
   - The scenario mentions using the "Search page function" to find results, which suggests a specific application feature related to searching within the app. It involves scrolling through long pages, indicating a consistent user interface behavior rather than a random occurrence. Therefore, this scenario describes a reproducible interaction with a fixed interface or feature of the application.

2. **Feature Utility and Experience Enhancement**:
   - The scenario pertains to a functional aspect of the app (search and navigation) rather than content-related issues like inaccurate content or advertisements. Improving the performance of the search feature to avoid slow scrolling would enhance the user experience, thus meeting the criteria for being a functional issue.

3. **Application Specificity and Normal Operation**:
   - The scenario does not mention any cross-application operations or conditions where the app is in a small window, background, or has a floating status. It describes a situation that occurs after the app is started normally.

Given that all three points are satisfied:

1. The scenario is tied to a specific and reproducible app feature ("Search page function").
2. The issue relates to app function and user experience improvement, not content-related issues.
3. The scenario is specific to one application and occurs during normal app operation.

Therefore, the answer is:

YES  
Reason: The scenario describes a reproducible issue with a specific application feature that, if addressed, could enhance user experience, and it occurs under normal app operation.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Every time opening the app, it goes black.  Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the information provided, let's evaluate the scenario against the criteria:

1. **Reproducibility**: The user states that "every time opening the app, it goes black." This indicates a specific issue that can be reproduced simply by launching the app. The scenario pertains to the application's launch interface, which is a fixed element, not appearing randomly.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The problem described—a black screen on launch—relates to the app's functionality and significantly affects user experience. It does not pertain to content-related issues like "inaccurate content" or problems related to advertisements.

3. **Cross-Application & App States**: The issue occurs when the app is started normally, not in a small window, background, or floating status. Furthermore, it is specific to this particular app and not related to other applications.

Given these considerations:

YES

Reason: The scenario is reproducible as it consistently occurs upon opening the app, thereby affecting a specific application page (the launch screen). It is a functionality issue rather than a content-related one and does not involve cross-application behavior.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario does not specify a particular page, feature, or interface within the app that experiences performance issues. It only mentions a general degradation of performance after an update, which may not be consistently reproducible as it lacks specificity.

2. The scenario is vague and doesn't clearly describe a feature that directly improves app functions or enhances user experience. It merely states that performance worsens, which is not inherently related to improving existing features.

3. The comment does not indicate whether the issue occurs within this specific application context or if it might be related to cross-application behavior. The performance issue is described in a very general sense without mentioning when or where it occurs within the app's lifecycle beyond being post-update.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue where "words have been disappearing," which seems to be a content-related issue rather than a functionality or feature-related problem. Content issues (such as disappearing words) are not typically considered part of core functionality improvement unless they affect usability, but the description does not make it clear that this is directly related to how the app functions as a feature. Additionally, the problem is temporary and is resolved by disabling the app in settings, which may suggest it's more related to app behavior or bugs rather than a fixed feature/interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:
1. The scenario "The top of the page starts glitching when scrolling" does not specify a particular application page or widget/feature, which makes it difficult to consider the problem reproducible as a specific, consistent issue.
2. The scenario described is related to the app's function (potentially involving scrolling and rendering issues), which, if present, could enhance user experience if resolved, and is not content-related like ads or content accuracy.
3. The scenario specifies a glitch when the app is used normally, thus meeting the condition that it not occur in small window, background, or floating status. However, without specificity in point 1, it cannot be fully verified as reproducible across all app contexts.
As point 1 is not fully satisfied, the output is 'NO'.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
Reason:  
- The scenario does not specify a particular page or feature of the app where the issue occurs. The description of "the page continues to refresh when searching" is vague and lacks detail on which page or element within the app is involved. This makes it difficult to confirm whether the issue happens on a fixed interface or is random.
- The scenario does mention the search feature but does not clarify whether this is an existing feature or a suggestion for an addition. If it's a suggestion for an addition, it would not be relevant to the current functionality of the app.
- The description does not provide enough information to determine whether this issue occurs specifically after starting the app normally, and whether it is relevant to the primary app interface or happens when the app is in a minimized or background state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described, "images and words clipping into each other," does not provide specific information about whether it occurs on a specific application page, widget, or feature. This makes it difficult to determine if it's a fixed interface issue that can be easily reproduced. Without more context, it's possible that the issue might happen under certain conditions like specific screen sizes or orientations, but that isn't clear from the description. Additionally, while the issue might impact user experience, the lack of specificity prevents a conclusion about its consistent reproducibility across relevant scenarios.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario describes the app randomly flipping between light and dark mode for no reason. It does not specify a specific page or feature of the application where this problem occurs, so it seems random rather than a fixed interface issue. 

2. The scenario described is related to the user interface and could impact the user's experience by causing confusion or discomfort, so it is indeed a functional issue rather than a content-related one. 

3. The scenario happens within the application itself and does not indicate cross-application influences. Also, the fact that it occurs after the app has started normally is consistent with the scenario described.

However, due to the first point regarding the lack of specifics in the scenario, it fails to meet all three points together.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario described suggests that the app is missing from the homescreen after an update, and the user cannot drag and drop it even though a search finds it. This seems like an issue related to the app's behavior on the homescreen, which could depend on specific device configurations or settings (e.g., launcher settings or home screen configuration). It's not a fixed interface problem of the app itself, and could be linked to external factors like OS or launcher settings, making it harder to reproduce consistently across devices.
  
2. **Feature Description**: The scenario does not describe a feature of the app but rather an issue with the app's visibility and interaction with the homescreen. It is not related to a feature enhancement but rather a malfunction or bug. So, it does not meet the requirement for a helpful feature aimed at improving the app's function or user experience.

3. **Cross-application Issues**: The problem described in the scenario seems to be device-specific, potentially related to how the app interacts with the launcher or OS, rather than an issue strictly within the app itself. Therefore, it might not be confined to a single app, which makes it potentially cross-application (depending on the system or launcher used). 

This leads to the conclusion that the scenario is not reproducible consistently within the app's own context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves the app disappearing from the user's Google folder, which is likely an issue related to the organization of apps on the user's device rather than a specific application page or feature. This scenario is not about a specific feature or interface of the app itself and could potentially be a user-specific or device-specific issue. Additionally, it might not be directly related to the functionality of the app but rather how apps are managed on the user's device, which does not meet the criteria for being a fixed interface scenario within the app. Moreover, this scenario is not about enhancing or improving the app's functionality or user experience but rather a problem related to app organization on the device. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions outlined in the problem statement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The user experiences changes in the "duet" feature and feels frustrated with inconsistent modifications over time.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario mentions changes in the "duet" feature and inconsistent modifications, but it does not specify how or where these changes manifest within the app. Without a specific application page or widget being identified, it may be difficult to reproduce the scenario consistently.  
2. While the "duet" feature is likely a functional aspect of the app, the complaint about inconsistent modifications over time does not directly relate to a typical functional enhancement or user experience feature. It rather suggests a content-related or potentially interface consistency issue, which can be interpreted differently by users.   
3. The scenario, as presented, focuses on a specific feature of a single app and does not mention any cross-application activity or issues. However, the description lacks clarity on whether the feature concern is tied to a specific version or configuration.   
Overall, the ambiguity and lack of specificity in the scenario make it less likely to be reproducible in a controlled manner.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario is not specific enough to determine if it is reproducible. The description of "changes in the 'home' feature" and "inconsistent modifications over time" is vague and does not specify any particular aspect of the home feature, such as specific buttons or widgets being changed. Additionally, the frustration mentioned could relate to content-related issues, such as unexpected content placement or potential interface design changes rather than functionality improvements. Without specific details, it is challenging to verify if this scenario consistently appears in a fixed manner within the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility of the Scenario**: The scenario does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the Payjustnow app. It only mentions that the app does not work in Chrome, but does not provide details on what part of the app or functionality is not working, making it unclear whether this is a fixed issue or a random one. Without knowing the specific functionality or behavior in the app, we cannot confirm if the problem is reproducible in a fixed context.  
2. **Helpful Feature Description**: The scenario describes a failure (the app not working in Chrome), but it does not describe a feature or functionality that is intended to enhance the user experience or improve the app's functions. Instead, it reports a bug or issue.  
3. **Cross-Application Issue**: The issue specifically mentions the app not working in Chrome, which suggests it could be related to the browser rather than the app itself. This may involve external factors such as browser compatibility, making it cross-application and not exclusive to the app.  

Given these points, the scenario does not meet the criteria to be considered reproducible or as a helpful feature description.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described ("Switching tabs is delayed") does not specify a particular application page or specific widget/feature. It is a general issue that can arise due to various reasons such as device performance, app version, or network conditions, making it potentially random rather than a fixed interface issue. While the scenario could be considered helpful for improving user experience by enhancing app performance, it lacks specificity in terms of reproducibility on a consistent interface, as required by the first point.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: While the delay in pressing the new tab button can be a reproducible scenario specific to the app's interface, meeting point 1, it does not necessarily enhance functionality or improve user experience as much as it addresses a performance issue, failing point 2. Also, it is contextually based on the app's normal operational state, meeting point 3. However, since point 2 is not clearly met, the overall response is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario "Opening the tab switcher is delayed" is not fully reproducible based on the provided criteria. Although it pertains to a specific feature within an application (the tab switcher), which suggests a fixed interface, it's unclear whether this delay is a consistent and reproducible issue. The description does not guarantee that it does not appear randomly, and therefore might not meet the criterion for a fixed interface scenario. Additionally, the issue's reproducibility cannot be assessed without further information on the context in which the delay occurs.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario describes the action of attempting to remove the search bar from the home screen, which pertains to application functionality and user experience. However, it is not made clear if this is a fixed feature across all users or if different versions or settings might affect its presence on the home screen. Furthermore, the scenario does not specify if this action is available in the app’s settings or interface, and it could be a suggestion by the user if the app does not inherently have the capability to remove the search bar. Thus, without confirmation that the app should allow for this modification as a feature, the scenario does not meet all the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
**Reason:** The scenario described is somewhat vague and lacks specificity. The user mentions that the "page is unresponsive" and "shows again and again in the browser on the laptop," but this does not describe a specific application page, feature, or widget. The issue also seems to be related to the browser environment rather than a fixed interface of the app itself, which makes it appear more like a cross-application issue. Furthermore, the description does not indicate the behavior of a particular app feature but seems to focus on a general performance issue in a browser context, which does not fulfill the requirement of describing a fixed application behavior.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**

Reason:
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a specific situation (watching movies in fullscreen mode) and an issue with the navigation bar appearing when it shouldn't. While this can be reproducible if the movie app has this fullscreen mode functionality, the review doesn't specify whether this is a fixed behavior or occurs randomly. The description is not specific enough to confirm that it's consistently a problem in that mode, and could vary based on the app or device configuration. Hence, it's unclear if the scenario is reproducible in a controlled manner.
  
2. **Helpfulness for improving app functions**: The scenario seems more related to UI behavior (how the navigation bar interacts with fullscreen mode), which could enhance the user experience by ensuring a cleaner interface while watching videos. This could be considered helpful in improving the app's user interface, but the review doesn’t clarify if it's an issue in terms of the app functionality itself, nor does it provide actionable feedback for enhancement. It could be seen as a minor usability issue, but not a critical functionality improvement.

3. **Cross-application issue**: The scenario is specific to the app in question. The review mentions the issue occurring only when the app is in fullscreen mode, not in any other status (e.g., windowed or background). Therefore, this does not appear to be a cross-application issue. 

Because point 1 about reproducibility is not fully clear, and the rest of the points are somewhat ambiguous, the answer is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a specific issue where Chrome cancels the action, minimizes the keyboard, and displays a "viewing live page" message. While this describes a specific interaction, it may not be consistently reproducible as it could be influenced by the state of the browser, network conditions, or particular settings. This event does not clearly describe a consistent feature of the application but rather seems to reflect an unusual behavior or bug.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The scenario seems to be describing a malfunction (automatically cancelling typing and minimizing the keyboard) rather than a feature that enhances functionality or user experience. Addressing this may improve user experience by fixing a bug, but it isn't a feature enhancement or addition.

3. **Cross-Application**: The scenario appears to specifically address the behavior within a single app (Chrome) and isn't an issue of integration or cross-application, which meets this criterion. However, the description of "viewing live page" could imply interaction with a live-update feature or connectivity with a server, which is unclear and makes it ambiguous regarding fixed interface status.

Overall, the scenario does not definitively meet all the criteria to be assessed as an improvement to a specific feature of the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario provided describes opening several pages where each creates a tab. However, it does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature within a fixed interface of a specific app. Without specifying the app's unique elements, it is challenging to confirm if the scenario is reproducible across different instances. The scenario needs more specificity regarding the app in question to confirm that it isn't a cross-application issue or user-suggested feature. Additionally, the description lacks details on whether this feature directly enhances user experience or improves app functions.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described does not clearly specify a particular page or feature within the application. While it mentions "close a tab," it is not clear whether this refers to a specific part of the app, such as a browser-style tab or some other UI component. The absence of this specificity makes it unclear whether this is a fixed interface issue or a random occurrence.
   
2. The feature described does not seem to directly enhance the functionality or user experience. It sounds more like a UI glitch (a visual issue when closing a tab) rather than an intentional feature to improve user interaction. This would be more of a bug fix rather than a feature enhancement.

3. The scenario could potentially apply to different types of applications (e.g., browsers, messaging apps, or any app with a tab-based UI). This indicates the issue may not be confined to a specific app or interface, suggesting it might be cross-application. The description does not rule out this possibility.

Therefore, the scenario does not meet all the required conditions for a "YES."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario is not fully reproducible because it describes a vague investigation ("Investigate the current version of Chrome to identify new features") rather than a specific issue or bug with a clear, reproducible behavior. It doesn't point to a fixed interface, page, or widget, nor does it describe an existing feature that can be directly tested or confirmed as part of the app’s functionality. Additionally, the scenario seems more like a request for discovering new features (potentially related to Samsung and/or Google), rather than reporting an actual bug or problem with the app's performance or usability. Therefore, the scenario fails to meet the first condition of being a reproducible, specific issue in the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Since the dark theme feature is not currently available, it does not meet the criteria of describing a specific, reproducible application feature or issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The editor suggests using Gboard for GIF support.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: The scenario does not meet the first point because it suggests using Gboard for GIF support, which indicates that the app does not currently have built-in GIF support and relies on an external solution (Gboard). This implies that the issue mentioned is more about a missing feature rather than something that is reproducible within the app itself. Additionally, the comment appears to be a suggestion for a feature addition, not a description of an existing feature or issue with the current functionality of the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The voice messaging feature can be found in the search bar appearing as a microphone.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario describes a specific feature, the voice messaging feature, being located in a specific place, the search bar as a microphone. This suggests that it is a fixed interface element in the application, and since it is not suggested for addition, it indicates that the app currently includes this feature.  
2. The voice messaging feature is a functional enhancement that improves user interaction by allowing users to send messages using their voice, which enhances usability and user experience. It is not related to content issues or ad-related problems.  
3. The scenario is contained within a single application and directly relates to its interface once the app is started normally, not in a minimized or background state. Hence, it is not cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Reach a URL site but no information appears and the site is unusable as interactive. Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To evaluate the scenario against the specified criteria, let's analyze each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: 
   - The scenario involves reaching a URL site where no information appears. This suggests a specific occurrence related to the way the app interacts with certain websites or URLs. Assuming this is a consistent issue with a particular feature of the app (e.g., an in-app browser loading external URLs), the issue seems tied to a fixed interface and not random.
   - Since the scenario doesn't mention anything about features suggested for addition, it appears to relate to existing features.

2. **Non-content related improvement**:
   - The scenario focuses on functionality — namely, the display and usability of a URL within the app. This is related to improving the app's interactive function and user experience, rather than content issues or ads.

3. **Non-cross-application**:
   - The description implies this happens within the app when interacting with a URL. It doesn't suggest that this issue is occurring due to interactions with other apps or when the app is minimized or in a floating status.

Given these points, the criteria seem to be met. Therefore, the output is:

YES
Reason: The issue is related to a specific feature (URL loading) within the app, is not linked to content-related complaints like ads, and does not involve cross-application behavior or scenarios when the app is minimized or not in active use.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:After uninstalling the latest version, web searches work.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario involves uninstalling an app to resolve an issue with web searches. This suggests that the problem may be related to conflicts or interactions between the app and the device's system or other apps, making it cross-application in nature. Additionally, the scenario does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within the app itself that can be tested or reproduced directly. As a result, it fails to meet the requirement of being a fixed interface within the application and not being cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To determine whether the scenario meets the given criteria, let's evaluate each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes an action — attempting to pull a video track forward, which is typically a specific feature in video or media player apps. Since this action relates to the functionality of a video track bar, it is likely a fixed part of the application's interface. Therefore, this scenario is likely reproducible within the app if the described feature exists in the app.

2. **Feature Utility**: The scenario highlights an issue with the video track bar disappearing and the video pausing when the user attempts to pull the track forward. This is related to app functionality, not content-related issues. Fixing this issue would enhance user experience by ensuring smoother interaction with media playback features.

3. **Cross-Application and App State**: The scenario does not suggest that it occurs across multiple applications or in a minimized/backgrounded state. It appears to happen during normal app usage after starting the app.

Since all the points are met, the output is:

YES  
Reason: The scenario describes a reproducible issue with a specific feature (video track bar) in the app that impacts functionality and user experience. It does not involve cross-application issues or issues with the app's minimized state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: Although the scenario involves a specific feature (making reels) and describes an error encountered (the "something went wrong" message), it does not specify if this occurs on a specific application page or fixed interface. Additionally, the error could potentially be random, not fixed to a specific interaction or interface. The problem described is also not inherently cross-application or content-related. However, since the specific conditions required to reproduce the issue are not detailed explicitly, it does not satisfy the requirement for a fixed interface scenario.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To judge whether the scenario "Sending support tickets to report the issue" meets the criteria, let's evaluate it against each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: 
   - The scenario mentions a feature where users can send support tickets. This implies a specific feature or interface within the app that allows users to report issues. If this is a standard feature of the app (e.g., accessible through a help or support section), it would likely be a fixed interface and reproducible.

2. **Improving Application Functions and User Experience**:
   - Sending support tickets is a feature that allows users to communicate issues or feedback directly to developers, which is crucial for maintenance and enhancement of the app. This feature contributes positively to user experience as it provides a direct channel for users to report their problems.

3. **Scenario Applicability**:
   - The scenario does not suggest it happens in a cross-application context or under non-standard conditions like minimizing the app. It is a normal functionality accessed when the app is used regularly.

Considering the above evaluations:

1) YES  
Reason: The scenario "Sending support tickets to report the issue" meets all three criteria. It describes a reproducible feature within the app, is helpful for improving the application and user experience, and is a scenario expected to occur when the application is started normally, without involving cross-application elements.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Couldn't refresh any content on the app.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario "Couldn't refresh any content on the app" lacks specificity about a particular application page, widget, or feature. Without details on which part of the app is affected, it's not possible to determine if the issue is with a fixed interface and not a random occurrence.  
2. The scenario itself does not describe a specific feature that can be improved; it is a general issue related to content refresh failure. Without additional details, it's unclear if addressing this would enhance functionality or user experience.  
3. The scenario is described in a manner that could potentially happen in various applications, as content refresh issues are common and not necessarily unique to a particular app, thus it could potentially be cross-application.  

Overall, the lack of specificity and detail in the scenario prevents it from meeting the outlined criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To determine whether the scenario is reproducible according to the criteria provided, let's evaluate it against each of the specified points:

1. **Is the scenario reproducible and specific?**
   - The scenario mentions an "unexpected error message" when trying to log in. This describes a specific application page or feature—the login page or login functionality. It seems to be a fixed interface of the application rather than appearing randomly.

2. **Is the feature described helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience?**
   - Yes, the ability to log in is a fundamental feature of most apps that require user authentication. Ensuring users can log in without encountering errors is crucial to improving application functionality and user experience. It is not related to content issues like ads or inaccurate content.

3. **Does the scenario occur within one application and not in a small window, background, or floating status?**
   - The scenario involves attempting to log in, which would typically be done in the foreground of the application after it has been started normally. There is no indication that this occurs in a multi-app environment or when the app is in an unusual state like a small window or floating status.

Given this analysis, all three points appear to be met for the scenario:

1) YES
Reason: The login issue is a specific, reproducible feature scenario within the application, crucial to user experience, and occurs in a standard app state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario mentioned appears to be specific and related to a feature within the application (resizing stories), which addresses point 1. This feature is relevant for improving functionality and user experience, meeting point 2. However, point 3 is not necessarily applicable based on the provided scenario alone. There's no explicit mention that would guarantee this issue only occurs under normal app operation and cannot occur in other app states like small window or background modes. Therefore, without additional information explicitly confirming adherence to point 3, the condition is not fully satisfied.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described can potentially be an issue across multiple video-playing applications, not tied to a specific application page or widget. This issue occurs when users attempt to skip parts of a video and encounter restrictions, a common functionality across various apps. Also, it is unclear if any particular app interface always restricts skipping, as the problem might only appear under certain conditions (e.g. specific video content requirements or permissions set by the content provider), making it not a fixed interface scenario. Furthermore, the complaint relates to video functionality, which could be content-related, depending on the platform's rules regarding skippable segments, and the scenario could occur in different applications. There is no indication of a problem occurring only after starting the app normally.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Recent algorithm changes have reduced the reach of the user's posts by more than 90%.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a change in the algorithm that affects the reach of users' posts, which is not a specific, reproducible sequence of user actions or interaction with a specific application page or widget. It is more related to backend processing and not a fixed interface that users interact with directly. Additionally, this scenario involves content distribution, which might be related to content issues, and it does not mention a specific feature or page within the app that can be consistently tested or reproduced.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility:** The scenario described—"Instagram is not letting the user open any of their accounts"—is vague and does not refer to a specific page, widget, or feature of the app. It lacks detail about where in the app the issue occurs, making it difficult to determine if it is a fixed interface problem or something that happens randomly.
2. **Feature Impact:** The scenario does not describe a feature of the app that would directly improve app functionality or user experience. It points to a problem (accounts not opening), but it doesn't specify a feature that could be enhanced or improved; instead, it describes a failure or issue with existing functionality.
3. **Cross-application issue:** The scenario does not appear to be cross-application, but it also doesn't mention whether the issue occurs under normal app conditions or only in specific circumstances, making it harder to judge its occurrence in a specific context.

Thus, the scenario is not clear or specific enough to meet all the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described mentions a specific issue with Instagram's story feature, where stories are not visible in chat, and there is a message prompting the user to use the latest version of the app. This scenario could be version-specific, as it suggests updating app versions to resolve the issue. Furthermore, while the scenario does involve a specific feature (Instagram Stories within chat), the problem could be related to app updates rather than a fixed interface issue. It is also related to a generic feature that may be affected by app versioning and not just a specific app functionality issue. Additionally, it might not be entirely clear if the scenario is consistently reproducible, as it may depend on using an outdated app version.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not specific to a fixed interface or feature of a particular app; it mentions "issues with the Android system," which implies a problem possibly not tied to a single app but rather the broader Android operating system or video playback behavior across multiple apps.  
2. The scenario does suggest a feature (video rewind or forward) that is typically related to enhancing user experience in controlling video playback. However, as it describes a potential Android system issue, it may not relate directly to a specific app's feature improvement.  
3. Since the scenario seems linked to the Android system, it is a cross-application issue and not confined to one specific app.  

Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being reproducible within a single specific app context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario states user dissatisfaction with the "reels" feature, which is a specific feature of an app and thus satisfies the first condition about reproducibility. However, the scenario is centered around dissatisfaction, which does not inherently contribute to improving app functionality or user experience if it's simply about expressing displeasure without any contextual issues related to app functions (e.g., bugs, performance). Since the comment does not provide specific functional issues or improvements related to the feature, it does not fully satisfy condition two. The third condition is likely met since it is a feature within a specific app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:User expresses dissatisfaction with the "HDR videos" feature.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario does not describe a specific page, widget, or interface element of the app. The user simply mentions dissatisfaction with the "HDR videos" feature without giving context about where or how the feature is used within the app. It is unclear if this feature is part of a fixed, specific interface or if it appears randomly.  
2. The issue described in the comment appears to be related to the feature's performance (dissatisfaction with "HDR videos"), which could be seen as a content-related issue rather than a functional problem (i.e., it doesn't explain an app bug or failure).  
3. There's no information about the scenario being tied to the app's normal state or a specific interface—it only references a general dissatisfaction with a feature, and doesn't address app interaction in a regular mode.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:User requests the option to disable certain features such as "reels" and "HDR videos".Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario described involves a request for the option to disable certain features ("reels" and "HDR videos"). This indicates that these options do not currently exist in the application, meaning the scenario is not currently reproducible within the app's existing interface. The user is suggesting an enhancement rather than reporting an existing feature interaction.

2. The request to disable "reels" and "HDR videos" is more likely related to user experience and functionality improvement rather than content-related issues. So this point is met.

3. The scenario does not mention cross-application behavior, nor does it specify issues related to window size or the app being in the background. The scenario describes a feature request that is relevant to the app when used normally.

Overall, since the first point is not satisfied, the output is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:When attempting to control the duration of a reel using the scroll duration bar, the video becomes stuck.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not fully reproducible because it does not mention a specific page or widget in the app. It only references a "scroll duration bar" and doesn't clarify where or how the user interacts with it in the app. Without clear identification of the specific feature or interface, it's difficult to confirm if the problem occurs in a fixed interface of the app.  
2. The feature described (scroll duration bar) is indeed related to the app's functionality and could improve user experience by controlling video duration. However, this doesn’t necessarily imply it’s a fixed feature of the app. The scenario could describe a feature that isn't universally available or may depend on other conditions not outlined in the review.
3. The scenario appears to describe a specific issue with the app’s video controls, which is not cross-application. However, since the details about the interface and where the issue occurs are not clear enough, we cannot fully confirm this based on the available description.

Thus, due to insufficient clarity regarding the specific interface and feature, the scenario cannot be conclusively deemed reproducible based on the provided information.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The app force closes when attempting to control the duration of a reel using the scroll duration bar.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is reproducible because it involves a specific feature of the app, which is the "scroll duration bar" for controlling the duration of a reel. This is a defined interface element and not a random occurrence. It is not a suggested feature to be added by the user; therefore, it indicates an existing function that can be directly tested.  
2. The issue described is related to the app's functionality, namely, the app force closing during interaction with a functional element. Fixing this problem would enhance user experience by ensuring smoother app operation and reliability when using this feature. It is not related to content issues like inaccurate content or excessive ads.  
3. The problem is isolated to this specific app feature and occurs during normal app usage, not when the app is in a secondary or minimized state. Therefore, it does not involve scenarios such as the app being in a small window or background state, making it unlikely to be a cross-application issue.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES

Reason: 
1. The scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific issue with navigating from the notification list to a particular feature within the app (photo versus comments), implying a consistent interface behavior.
2. The feature described (navigating to the correct photo when clicking on reactions) is directly related to enhancing user experience, as it pertains to usability and convenience within the app's UI.
3. The scenario is confined to a single app and its standard operation (after being started normally), not affected by it being in a smaller window, background state, or when floated.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**

Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario described does not appear to involve a fixed interface or a specific feature that can be reliably reproduced. The description "No issue occurs with reels when clicking on the reactions in the notification list" suggests that the issue is tied to a user action (clicking on reactions) but doesn't provide clear information about a specific feature that would trigger a consistent, reproducible issue. This seems more like a description of normal behavior (i.e., no issue occurs) rather than an error or bug scenario, so it is unclear whether it is a reproducible issue.
   
2. **Impact on functionality and user experience**: The description focuses on the absence of an issue (no problem with reactions when clicking on notifications), which does not directly highlight a potential functional improvement or enhancement. It doesn't indicate a missing feature or problem in the app's core functionalities.

3. **Cross-application issue**: The scenario appears specific to an app feature (the reels and notification reactions), so it doesn't seem like a cross-application issue. However, the ambiguity of the description makes it harder to confirm whether this is solely app-dependent.

Hence, it doesn't meet the required conditions for reproducibility and addressing an issue that impacts functionality, so the answer is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Cannot see comments on Reels.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario "Cannot see comments on Reels" seems to describe an issue with the display of comments within the Reels feature. However, it does not explicitly mention a specific page or widget in the app, which is necessary to confirm it as a fixed interface. It’s unclear whether this issue is occurring randomly or consistently across the app.
2. The scenario is about functionality (seeing comments), which is relevant for improving user experience. However, there is some ambiguity regarding whether this issue is related to app settings, user permissions, or other content-related factors that might cause the issue (e.g., comments not loaded or visibility settings).
3. This scenario is specific to the Reels feature and the display of comments, so it is an app-specific issue. However, there is no indication that it relates to a cross-application scenario (e.g., interaction with other apps or processes).I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO
Reason: 

1. The scenario of "cannot see profile and cannot access the saved option" does not specify whether these issues occur on a specific application page or a specific widget/feature. Without knowing if these are fixed interface components, it is unclear if the scenario is reproducible.

2. Although being able to access profile and saved options are helpful features, the scenario description does not provide a detailed context for these issues making it difficult to assess if they are indeed functional improvements as opposed to user errors or temporary glitches.

3. The scenario description does not indicate it is related to issues occurring when using the app in a small window, background, or floating status. However, it meets the condition of the issue not being cross-application but this alone does not fulfill all criteria required for a "YES" response.

Since not all points are clearly met, the answer is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described pertains to logging out and logging back into the account, which does not specify a fixed interface or widget; it could potentially involve different screens or widgets related to login/logout features, making it difficult to reproduce under controlled conditions without additional context. Furthermore, while the issue may affect usability, the description itself does not clarify if it's due to a specific application feature, and it remains ambiguous without more specific details on the login process. Lastly, the scenario does not specify if the issue happens solely within the app itself and whether other external factors contribute to the problem.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario **does not describe a fixed interface** or a specific widget, as the user simply mentions the ability to pause reels, but does not clarify whether this applies to a specific page or feature. The description lacks specificity about the page or interface element affected (e.g., whether this issue occurs only on the Reels page or on certain devices). Therefore, it's not clear if this is reproducible in a consistent manner.  
2) The feature described (the ability to pause reels) is functional, but it's not explicitly mentioned as improving the app's overall functionality. While this feature may improve user experience, the description of the issue doesn't necessarily imply that it's a core feature that's critical for the app's functionality.  
3) The scenario appears **not to be cross-application**, but there is no indication that the problem occurs in the main app interface rather than possibly in smaller windows, pop-ups, or background status (the user's comment is too vague on this point).

Thus, the scenario doesn't meet all the criteria clearly enough to be classified as reproducible.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES

Reason: The scenario described in the user comment meets all three points:

1. Reproducibility: The scenario describes a specific feature, the "NOTES option," which was initially available in the beta version of the app and then lost after an update. This suggests the feature is part of the app's fixed interface and not a randomly appearing element, making the scenario reproducible for developers who can test the app before and after the update.

2. Feature Improvement: The "NOTES option" is a functional feature of the app, and its availability or unavailability directly impacts the user experience by enhancing the app's utility. Restoring or maintaining access to this feature could improve user satisfaction and app usefulness.

3. Single Application Focus: The scenario is limited to the issue within the beta version of the app and does not involve any cross-application interactions or issues that arise from using the app in a minimized or altered state. The problem occurs with the app running normally, as described.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario does not mention a specific application page or widget other than a generic "message" and "home page," which might suggest it is not fixed across different app configurations or user actions. Without more detail, it is unclear if this is a consistent and specific scenario. Additionally, the described issue primarily revolves around app functionality (navigation behavior), which could potentially enhance user experience if fixed, but there's insufficient detail to ascertain if it's a cross-application issue. However, the lack of granularity in the scenario's description does not guarantee consistent reproducibility or clarity on customizing app functions for a better user experience.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a general issue ("Reels and videos in posts take forever to buffer") without specifying a particular page or widget in the app. It also does not describe a fixed interface or specific feature. The problem seems to occur across different content (Reels and videos), which suggests it might be a performance issue rather than a fixed feature-related bug. Therefore, it is not a fixed or specific feature of the app.  
2) **Helpful for improving functions**: While the described issue might be related to performance (slow buffering), it is more related to content delivery or network performance rather than a core function of the app. Therefore, it could be argued that this scenario does not directly improve or enhance the app's functional features.  
3) **Cross-application**: The issue described is app-specific (related to buffering of media within the app). However, the scenario does not mention whether it occurs in other apps or situations, but buffering issues are often linked to network conditions or app-specific infrastructure and not necessarily cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: The scenario describes the removal of a feature ("share to story") which is a change in the app's functionality rather than a specific reproducible issue. It does not mention a specific application page or widget where the problem occurs, so it does not meet the first point of being a fixed interface issue that can be reproduced. Additionally, the removal of a feature is not typically a bug or a problem with the app's performance but rather a change in design decisions, thus it doesn't directly enhance or improve application functions according to the second point. Finally, the scenario is specific to one app and doesn't mention cross-application issues.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**YES**

Reason:
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario is clearly reproducible. The issue involves the absence of the "unpin" option in a menu, which is a specific function that can be checked on a particular app page (likely the feeds or post list). This appears to be a fixed interface that should consistently be available, unless the function is not working correctly.
  
2. **Feature Relevance**: The described issue involves a feature that is part of the core app functionality — the ability to unpin posts. This is an interaction with an existing function, not a suggestion for an additional feature. It affects user experience directly as users expect to manage their pinned posts.

3. **Not Cross-application**: The issue seems tied to a specific feature (the "unpin" option) within the application, not something that happens across different apps. There is no mention of background or multi-window issues, so it seems like a scenario that happens when the app is functioning normally.

Thus, all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES

Reason: 
1. The scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific application feature (skimming reels) and does not mention any random occurrence. The user explicitly mentions trying to skim reels, indicating a fixed interface of the application.
2. The feature described (skimming reels) is related to app functionality and user experience, as it relates to the usability of navigating reels, not content-related issues like ads or inaccurate content.
3. The scenario is specific to the app in question and does not involve cross-application behavior. It discusses the freezing issue after normal app startup, not in a small window, background, or floating status.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Issue with watching video – not being able to scrub and experiencing freezes.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1) The scenario describes an issue with video playback, which seems to be related to a specific feature of the app (watching video), but it is not clear if the issue occurs on a fixed interface or page within the app. The review does not provide enough detail to determine if the problem happens consistently or randomly. The lack of specificity in terms of app page or feature makes it hard to confirm if the scenario is reproducible in a controlled way.
  
2) The issue described (inability to scrub and experiencing freezes) is a functional problem related to video playback, which fits the criteria of improving app functions and user experience. This is not a content-related issue.

3) The scenario does not indicate whether the issue occurs in cross-application scenarios or in non-standard app states (small window, background, etc.), making it unclear if the issue is app-specific or influenced by these factors.

Therefore, the scenario does not fully meet the requirements for a YES response.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: The scenario describes a situation where audio from old videos has been deleted or lost by Instagram, leading to playback issues. This issue appears to involve content that is no longer available, rather than a fixed interface or a specific feature issue within a reproducible scenario. The problem may be related to data retention or content management policies of Instagram, which are not part of core app functionalities that can be experimented with or reproduced within the app's standard features. As such, this makes it non-reproducible as it is dependent on specific content availability, rather than an app functionality or interface issue. Additionally, the scenario might not consistently occur since it involves specific old videos, further supporting the non-reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is specifically related to the action of moving the time scale of a reel, which suggests it is tied to a specific feature or widget of the video functionality in the app. This is not a random occurrence or a user-suggested feature, indicating it is part of the app's fixed interface.  
2. The issue of the video freezing when interacting with the time scale is related to the app's functionality and performance, so addressing it could improve the application functions and enhance user experience.  
3. The scenario is specific to this application and does not mention any cross-application functionality. It is stated to occur when the app is started normally, excluding cases when the app is not properly open (e.g., in a small window or background).I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario of user comments getting deleted is not specific to a fixed interface, page, or widget within the application. It does not describe a specific feature or functionality of the app that can be isolated and tested consistently. The issue seems related to content moderation or technical glitches, which do not pertain to a specific app feature interface. Additionally, this could be a platform-level issue or due to app policies rather than a feature intended to improve user experience. Furthermore, this issue does not involve any cross-application context, but it remains too general and lacks a concrete feature-based scenario.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:User randomly gets logged out from all accounts and can no longer log back in through the app.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**

**Reason:**  
1. **Reproducibility & Specificity**: The scenario described is a *random* issue ("User randomly gets logged out from all accounts"), which implies it doesn't follow a fixed pattern or occur on a specific page or widget. This randomness suggests it may be harder to reproduce and not tied to a specific feature of the app. The scenario isn't describing a specific app page, widget, or interface, so it doesn't meet the criterion of being a fixed, reproducible issue.

2. **Feature Improvement**: While the scenario describes a login/logout issue, it doesn't indicate a suggestion for an added feature; however, it's more about the application's functionality (login process) rather than enhancing user experience through new features. This part is met.

3. **Cross-Application Issue**: The scenario is isolated to the app itself and doesn't suggest that it could be an issue that happens across multiple applications. The focus is on the app's behavior when opened normally.

Thus, the issue appears random and not tied to a specific feature, so the answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described does not provide specific details about an application page or feature within an app. Checking an email and confirming account changes seems to be a cross-application action involving both the email app and the app managing the account. Furthermore, the scenario does not describe a functionality specific to a single application and seems more related to general email and account handling, which could involve more than one app. Without specific mention of a page or widget within a particular app, it does not meet the criteria for a reproducible scenario within a single application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario involves a cross-application issue between the app and the browser, which violates point 3. The user is experiencing a login issue specifically in the app but is able to log in through the browser. This indicates that the scenario involves functionality that spans two different applications, which does not meet the criteria for the scenario being contained within a single app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
**Reason:**  

1. **Specific Application Page/Feature:** The scenario describes an issue with "update features not reflecting," which is too general. It does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature within Instagram. For reproducibility, a specific part of the app must be mentioned.

2. **Feature Improvement:** While updates improving app functionality are helpful, the comment lacks clarity on which features or functions are impacted. Without this detail, it's unclear how addressing the issue would enhance user experience.

3. **Cross-Application Scenario:** The scenario potentially involves external factors, such as the App Store or device cache, impacting updates. This may extend beyond Instagram itself, violating the cross-application rule.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described is not reproducible within a fixed interface of the application. The user is referring to the overall reach and engagement of their reels, which are influenced by various external factors such as content quality, audience behavior, and algorithm changes, rather than a specific app feature or widget.  
2. The issue described relates to content reach and engagement, which are content-related concerns rather than app functionality or user experience enhancements.  
3. Although the scenario doesn't specify cross-application issues, it also doesn't fulfill the first two conditions, making point three irrelevant in this context.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason: 
1. The scenario described ("Observing that other creators gain followers easily, but experiencing poor reach personally") is not specific to a fixed interface or a particular widget/feature of the application. It is a general observation and could be influenced by many external factors such as content quality, engagement strategies, or platform algorithms, and hence is not reproducible based on a fixed app feature or interface.
2. This scenario does not describe a specific app feature that can be adjusted or improved by developers to enhance user experience directly. It pertains to content reach and visibility rather than a functional aspect of the app that developers can modify.
3. The issue is not stated to be dependent on app window size or background operations, but it is also not confined to a particular app, as such experiences can occur across various social media platforms and content-sharing apps.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: The scenario of not being able to change the layout when making stories with multiple pictures as a collage is likely reproducible because it describes a specific feature within the application. This issue is not about content or advertisements, but rather a functionality of the app that directly affects the user experience. It does not suggest a feature for addition, indicating that the app already includes this feature but that it is not working as expected. The issue does not depend on the app being in a minimized or non-active state, and the description is focused within a single application, ensuring the scenario is not cross-application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: 

1. The scenario is reproducible: The comment describes a specific feature of the app (changing the layout while making a collage) which is a fixed interface of the application. This suggests a specific interaction that can be consistently tested to see if the problem occurs. The feature is already present in the app, so it is not a user-suggested addition.

2. The feature described is helpful for improving user experience: Being able to change the layout while making a collage is a core function of a collage-making app. Ensuring this feature works correctly is important for maintaining the app's functionality and enhancing user satisfaction.

3. The scenario does not involve cross-application or specific window states: The issue is described as occurring during normal usage of the app, without mention of small window or background operation. Therefore, it pertains to the standard operation scenario described in the problem statement.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To assess the given scenario "Share pictures" against the criteria provided, let's break it down:

1. **Reproducibility**:  
   - The scenario "Share pictures" implies a feature likely present in many apps such as social media platforms, photo editors, or messaging apps. This suggests it could describe a specific application feature or widget.
   - The ability to share pictures is not phrased as a suggestion for a new feature but rather implies an existing capability that might be having issues. 

2. **Improvement of Application Functions and User Experience**:  
   - Picture sharing is a core functionality for user engagement in many apps, especially those centered around communication or social interaction. Addressing issues related to picture sharing enhances user experience and is considered an improvement to the app's functions.

3. **Cross-Application**:  
   - The scenario does not inherently suggest actions across multiple apps. The issue likely resides within the specific application's picture-sharing feature. 
   - It's assumed to be about the app's internal handling of picture-sharing functionality as the description doesn't suggest otherwise.

Given this analysis, if the scenario meets the conditions outlined, it should be considered specific and relevant for testing within the particular app context.

**Output**:
YES

Reason: The scenario "Share pictures" refers to a specific application feature likely to be reproducible. It's crucial for enhancing user experience, focusing on internal functionality rather than content-related or cross-application issues.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a problem (Instagram app closing automatically upon opening) that could potentially be linked to various factors, such as device-specific issues, OS compatibility, app version, or temporary server problems, which may not be consistently reproducible across different devices or user environments. It does not specify a fixed interface or component of the app that is causing the problem, making reproducibility uncertain.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue is related to app stability rather than adding or improving a specific feature or functionality of the Instagram app. While resolving crashes enhances user experience, the scenario itself does not describe a particular feature enhancement.

3. **Cross-application**: The issue specifically pertains to the Instagram app and does not involve other applications. It occurs when Instagram is opened normally, which aligns with the requirement.

Since the reproducibility aspect is questionable and the scenario does not explicitly describe a feature improvement, the response is "NO".I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:When trying to comment on content, the user is unable to do so because the information is flagged as either misinformation or spam.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO

Reason:  
1. The scenario cannot be conclusively determined to be reproducible based on the given information. It describes a specific functionality issue (commenting being blocked due to content being flagged as misinformation or spam), but it does not specify if this issue consistently occurs on a specific application page or feature interface that does not change randomly. Without knowing whether this scenario always happens in a fixed part of the app, it cannot be confirmed as reproducible.

2. The feature described (commenting being flagged incorrectly) relates to content classification and moderation, which is a content-related issue. Although addressing this could improve user experience, it mainly involves the accuracy of content moderation, which falls under content-related issues, not the core functional enhancement of the application interface.

3. The issue described might occur due to cross-application data sharing or content moderation policies that affect multiple applications, especially if a third-party service is used for content moderation. Therefore, it might not be restricted to a particular app's standalone functioning after being started normally. 

Overall, since all points do not perfectly align, the answer is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario of experiencing global outages and being logged out frequently does not describe a specific application page or widget/feature that can be consistently reproduced. Global outages are external issues that affect the server and are not specific to the app's interface or functionality. Additionally, frequent logouts may be random or dependent on external factors such as network stability or server-side issues, not necessarily a fixed component of the app itself.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Recording moments using Instagram, receiving an "error" message, and losing the recorded content forever.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.
We do not care whether the issues mentioned in the comment actually occur, nor do we care whether the described scenario is related to the app version or the mobile device configuration.
You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described involves receiving an "error" message and losing recorded content on Instagram. However, the details provided are vague and do not specify whether this occurs on a particular page or feature within the Instagram app, such as the Story feature, direct video recording, or the Reels section. Without specific information, it cannot be determined that this is a fixed interface issue rather than a random occurrence, and thus it cannot be confidently reproduced.  

2. While the issue of losing recorded content is related to app functionality and user experience, the lack of specificity hinders direct actionable improvements because it doesn't specify the conditions or steps leading to the error.

3. The scenario is strictly within the Instagram app and doesn't involve interactions with other applications. However, due to insufficient detailed information on specific app interfaces or actions leading to the error, it doesn't fully meet the criteria for reproducibility as required for a "YES" response.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempt to log in repeatedly, but receive an error message stating "an unexpected loging in please try again."Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
To determine whether the problem scenario meets the outlined criteria, let's examine each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes an error message "an unexpected loging in please try again" when attempting to log in repeatedly. This indicates a specific application page (the login page) and a specific feature (the login functionality) which typically has a consistent interface. Therefore, it should be reproducible given that the error appears regularly under specific circumstances.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The issue impacts the application's functionality - specifically the login process. Enhancing login reliability and preventing such errors would significantly improve user experience, as logging in is a core feature of many mobile applications. This is not a content-related issue or about advertisement handling.

3. **Scenario Occurrence**: The scenario describes a login error which happens when the app is normally in use (not in a small window, background, or floating status) since logging in typically occurs when the app is actively in use. It doesn't involve cross-application scenarios.

Based on the assessment above, the scenario meets all three criteria.

Output:

YES  
Reason: The scenario involves reproducible steps on a specific interface (login page), addresses functional issues rather than content-related ones, and occurs when the app is normally active, not in a minimized or background state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Open Saved files and the app displays "Couldn't Refresh feed" continuously for 2 days despite attempts to fix it.Please judge: 1.

Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. It is unclear if the scenario describes a specific application page or feature that consistently leads to the issue. For reproducibility, it should specify whether the problem occurs specifically when accessing "Saved files" rather than being a random occurrence across various app features.  
   
2. The scenario does seem to involve a functional issue ("Couldn't Refresh feed") that is likely helpful to improving the app's functionality and user experience by addressing the problem with feed refreshing. However, the lack of detail about the specific interface involved doesn't sufficiently establish this is a consistent problem area.

3. The information provided does not indicate that the scenario is cross-application nor limited to specific windowing modes of the app, which meets the criteria in part. However, without meeting the first point distinctly, this point alone doesn't suffice for a 'YES.'I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Videos and pictures are not getting saved in certain albums.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario meets points 1 and 2, but fails point 3. The problem of videos and pictures not getting saved in certain albums is related to the app's functionality and user experience enhancement, and it is not about content-related issues. However, the scenario could potentially involve cross-application behavior because saving to albums might involve interactions with the device's file system or gallery app. Therefore, it is not solely dependent on the app itself and thus fails point 3.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Past stories from close friends were missing from the archive.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario and criteria, let's analyze whether all three points are met:

1. **Reproducibility:**
   - The scenario describes a feature/page of the app: The user mentions "past stories from close friends were missing from the archive," which suggests a specific feature related to archives and stories within the app. This is likely a fixed interface feature (archives of stories) and not something that appears randomly.
   - The described feature is not a suggestion for addition: The comment does not suggest adding the archive feature; it implies that the archive feature already exists but is not functioning as expected regarding stories from close friends.

2. **Feature relevance:**
   - The missing stories are likely related to a functional issue rather than a content-related issue like "inaccurate content" or "too many ads." Ensuring that all intended stories are archived correctly is important for the app's function and user experience, particularly for those who value preserving content.

3. **Application Boundaries:**
   - The issue is specific to the internal functionality of the app (archiving stories) and does not require cross-application functionality to test or reproduce.
   - The scenario occurs during normal app usage, not when the app is in a minimized or background state.

Given the evaluation above, the scenario does meet all the requirements.

Output:
YES
Reason: The scenario pertains to a specific feature within the app (missing stories from the archive), is relevant to functionality improvement and user experience (ensuring stories are properly archived), and is confined to the context of a single app functioning normally.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempt to scrub/scroll through a video using the progress bar, but the bar disappears upon interaction and doesn't reappear.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves an issue with the video progress bar disappearing upon interaction, which seems like a specific application feature issue that can potentially be reproducible, fulfilling point 1. It also involves improving user experience by ensuring the video controls function properly, meeting point 2. However, the scenario could potentially occur across different applications that use similar video playback features, which fails point 3, as the issue may not be unique to one specific app. Thus, not all three points are met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: The scenario meets all three points outlined in your criteria:  

1. *Reproducible Scenario*: The issue described involves changing the cover of a highlight within the app, which suggests a specific feature related to user interface operations. It's related to an apparent consistent bug in functionality (making images appear blurry and causing app restart), rather than randomness or a user-suggested feature not currently available.

2. *Helpful for Improvement*: The issue with the feature directly affects user experience by impacting the clarity of chosen images and app stability, both of which are critical for maintaining user satisfaction.

3. *Specific to Main App Interface*: There is no mention of the app being in a small window or background state; the problem appears after the user attempts to perform an action in a standard app session. The issue does not seem cross-application, as it specifically relates to an action taken within the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario appears to be reproducible because it describes a specific application feature—changing the cover of a highlight—and involves a specific issue with the image appearing blurry and causing the app to restart. This suggests a consistent problem with using a particular feature, rather than a random or suggested future function.  

2. This feature is related to application functionality and user experience, not content-related issues such as ads or content accuracy. Improving how app features like highlight covers work directly enhances user engagement and satisfaction.  

3. The scenario occurs during the normal operation of the app when attempting to change a highlight cover, rather than when the app is in a small window, background, or a floating status. This meets the requirement of happening during standard usage of the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described in the user comment is general and lacks specificity. It mentions that the app is "very laggy for Android users" but does not specify a particular application page, feature, or widget where the issue occurs. Without these specifics, it's challenging to reproduce the problem consistently, making it difficult to determine whether it is a fixed interface issue or something that appears randomly. Additionally, no particular feature is mentioned that could be improved for enhancing user experience, so this scenario mostly pertains to performance issues rather than functional improvements.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described, "The app does not send a password change email when requested," is reproducible as it pertains to a specific and fixed feature of the application—namely, the password change request via email. This is a standard feature in most apps and not a suggested feature for addition, hence it meets the criteria of a fixed interface.  
2. The feature of receiving a password change email is indeed helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience as it directly relates to account security and user access, rather than being a content-related issue or relating to advertisements.  
3. The scenario pertains to the app's feature set specifically and does not involve cross-application behavior. It is also presumed to occur when the app is running normally, not in a minimized or background state.  I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario described involves an unusual login behavior that might not be consistently reproducible. It mentions a specific issue related to automatic logout and a message about the password change, but it is unclear if this behavior is fixed and not random, or if it is a system error that occurs under certain conditions. Therefore, it's uncertain if this scenario is reproducible under the same set of operations consistently.

2. The login/logout feature is a critical aspect of the app's user experience, and fixing it would improve the app's functionality. So this point aligns with the scenario's importance in enhancing functionality and user experience.

3. The issue described is specific to Instagram and does not require cross-application interaction. It occurs within the app itself without involvement of another app.

Overall, the main uncertainty lies in the reproducibility of the issue, causing it to not meet all the required criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the scenario provided in the user comment, let's evaluate each point:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a user who is unable to follow anyone despite having verified account settings. This issue appears to occur in a fixed interface of the application related to account settings and following functionalities. The problem seems to persist consistently, not randomly or due to suggested features that the app currently lacks. Therefore, it meets the criteria for being a reproducible scenario.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The scenario describes a functional issue with following other users, which is core to many social media or content-sharing platforms. Fixing or improving this feature would indeed enhance application functions and the overall user experience, as being able to follow others is fundamental to user engagement and content interaction.

3. **Application Scope**: The scenario specifically concerns the functionality within a single application—it does not involve multiple applications. Moreover, the issue arises after the app has been started normally, not when the app is in a minimized, background, or floating state.

Since all three criteria are satisfied by the scenario described in the user review, the answer is:

**YES**

Reason: The scenario is reproducible as it involves a fixed feature (following others) in the application, enhancing core functionality is beneficial for user experience, and the issue is specific to the app when used in its normal state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario and your criteria:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario describes a specific feature—the video control bar used to forward or rewind a reel. This is likely a specific and fixed interface element of a video playing feature within an app, rather than a random occurrence. The user is not suggesting the addition of any feature, indicating that this functionality already exists within the app.

2. **Relevance for Application Improvement**: The described issue of the video hanging and becoming unresponsive when interacting with the video control bar is related to the app's functionality rather than its content. Ensuring that media controls work smoothly is crucial for user experience and thus is relevant for app improvements.

3. **Specificity to One Application**: The scenario is specific to the described functionality in one app, as no mention is made of similar issues occurring across multiple applications. It also specifies that the issue occurs when the app is started normally, not when it's in a minimized or floating state.

Given these evaluations, all three points seem to be met:

YES  
Reason: The scenario is associated with a specific, existing feature (video control bar) within a single application. The problem (video hanging becoming unresponsive) is related to app functionality, not content, and the issue occurs in normal app operation.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Copy a comment from somewhere or write a comment with some hashtags and have it removed immediately, even if it does not break the guidelines.
Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3. The scenario cannot be cross-application.The scenario does not occur when the app is in a small window, in the background or in poping up/floating status, but occurs after the app is started normally.

Reason: The scenario described involves copying a comment and having it removed immediately, suggesting an issue with the app's comment management or moderation feature. However, the scenario lacks specificity regarding a particular application page, widget, or feature, making it challenging to determine if it is a fixed interface of the application and not a random occurrence. Additionally, the removal of comments with hashtags may not necessarily relate to a feature improvement or enhanced user experience, as it could pertain to content moderation policies, which fall under content-related issues. Based on the information provided, it is not clear if this is an isolated incident or if it can be consistently reproduced across all instances of the application. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria outlined.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Experience a continuous pop-up notification about a comment being removed, which prevents the feed from refreshing.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. The scenario described is based on a pop-up notification about a comment being removed, which seems to be a specific issue that might not occur consistently across all devices or user accounts. It is unclear if this occurs on a specific application page or widget, and it may not be a fixed interface issue, suggesting it might appear randomly or under specific conditions not clearly detailed.

2. The feature described doesn't directly suggest improvements to application functions or user experience beyond removing the problematic loop of notifications. Instead, it describes an obstacle to use, which implies that fixing it would enhance the user experience, but the scenario itself is centered on a bug rather than a feature enhancement.

3. The scenario specifically involves reopening the Instagram app, indicating it is app-specific. However, without explicit mention of a fixed interface or consistent reproducibility, this point does not heavily weigh towards the 'YES' criteria.

In conclusion, the lack of specificity about the application's page or interface and whether this issue occurs consistently contributes to the decision.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described involves the subjective experience of the community guidelines process, which may not be tied to a specific, reproducible app feature or page. It is also related to content moderation, which is content-related rather than a functional or user experience feature intended to improve application performance. The scenario is too abstract and not specific enough to be considered a fixed interface of the application.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario could potentially be reproduced as it describes a specific application feature (login process) that occurs when attempting to access the account page. This appears to be a fixed interface of the application and is not random. However, the described scenario involves an error message that might not be specific to the application's interface itself but could be a server-side issue or rate-limiting measure, which makes it harder to determine if it will consistently occur. Furthermore, the scenario described involves an app function, which is not a content-related issue. However, without additional information indicating that this issue is specific to the app in question and not due to network issues or cross-application interactions, it does not fully satisfy all the criteria for being definitively reproducible within the context of the app alone. The issue could also potentially be related to the device or external factors outside the app’s interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:After the latest update, the pan and scan slider for videos is not working anymore.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
Based on the provided scenario and criteria:

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario refers to a specific feature ("pan and scan slider for videos") within a mobile app. It mentions that this feature stopped working after an update. This suggests that it is a specific, fixed interface component of the application and not a randomly appearing one. The feature is not a suggestion for addition but rather an existing component, thus meeting the first point.

2. **Feature Importance**: The ability for a pan and scan slider to work correctly is crucial for video functionality. This feature directly affects the usability and user experience of video content within the app, enhancing the app's overall functionality. It does not pertain to content-related issues like "inaccurate content" or "too many ads," fulfilling the second point.

3. **Cross-Application Scenarios**: The scenario specifically deals with an issue within the app itself, not across multiple apps or when the app is in a minimized or background state. It occurs when the app is started normally, thereby satisfying the third point.

Given that all the points are met, the output will be:

YES
Reason: The scenario describes a specific, existing feature that is not working as intended after an update. This feature is important for the app's functionality and user experience. The issue is confined to the app itself and does not involve interactions with other apps or app states.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario "Connect with friends" is too vague and does not specify a particular page, feature, or interface of the app. It does not describe a fixed element within the app, which makes it difficult to determine if it is reproducible under specific conditions. Furthermore, it could be referring to a feature that the user wishes to be added, rather than an existing feature, which means it may not be an issue the app currently supports.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario "Discover new trends" is too vague and does not specify a particular application page, widget, or feature that can be easily replicated. It could refer to various aspects like a news feed, trending topic section, or a separate feature designed for trend discovery, and without specific details, it cannot be determined if this is a consistent part of the app or if this suggestion reflects a desire for a new feature. Moreover, nothing in the scenario description clearly enhances app functionality or user experience as it stands and does not involve non-content related issues.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves features like "stories and IGTV," which are typically associated with social media applications like Instagram. While these features might be specific and reproducible within such an app, the scenario description lacks context about any particular issue or problem being encountered by the user, making it unclear if there's a specific interface or function failure involved. Additionally, without knowing if the user is suggesting these features for inclusion or talking about existing issues, it's difficult to fully assess if point 1 is met. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot conclusively determine that all three criteria are satisfied.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves an "algorithmic feed," which is a feature that can be found in many mobile applications. However, the term "frustrating" does not provide a specific reproducible action or issue. The description lacks specificity about what exactly makes interacting with the feed frustrating, such as freezing, navigation issues, or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the issue seems to be potentially content-related, which goes against the criteria stated in point 2. The scenario does not explicitly meet the criteria outlined in the three points for it to be a clear, reproducible technical issue aimed at enhancing user experience.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
To assess the given scenario against the criteria, let's go through each point:

1. **Reproducibility and Specificity**:  
   - The scenario is about a user uninstallation and reinstallation followed by encountering an error during login to an existing account. 
   - This scenario is reproducible because it describes a specific sequence of actions (uninstall, reinstall, attempt login).
   - The error notification occurs on the login page, which is a specific interface screen within an application, not a random event and doesn't involve a user-suggested feature.
   - Thus, this aspect is met.

2. **Feature Functionality and User Experience**:  
   - The issue described affects the app’s functionality (ability to log in) directly impacting user experience negatively as it prevents access.
   - It is not related to content inaccuracies or ad issues.
   - Therefore, this criterion is satisfied since it highlights a functional problem, not a content-related one.

3. **Cross-application Relevance**:
   - The scenario is about a workflow (uninstallation, reinstallation, and login) within the same application, so it is not cross-application.
   - The issue occurs upon a normal start of the app (post-reinstallation login attempt), not when it is in background or floating state.

All points have been addressed positively in relation to the criteria provided.

**Output**:
```
YES
Reason: The scenario is reproducible, specific to a fixed interface, and highlights a functional issue. It occurs within the same app after normal launch, and is not related to content or ads.

Reason: The scenario does not meet the first point. The issue described in the scenario seems to be associated with logging into an account on a laptop, which suggests that the scenario may not be related to the specific application on a mobile device or may not describe a fixed interface or feature within the mobile app itself.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario may not be universally reproducible because it doesn't specify if the absence of frequent contacts in the sharing interface is consistent across all users. Different user experiences could be due to varied contact history, app settings, or permissions. Additionally, there's no way to confirm that this feature is a fixed part of the application and not influenced by individual user data or app behavior at a certain time. Without specific context, it cannot be ensured that this feature is intended to function the same way for every user, failing point 1 of the requirements.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: 

1. The scenario is broad and relates to content recommendations, which can vary based on individual user interactions, preferences, and changes in trending topics. It does not describe a fixed interface or a specific feature that consistently behaves in a certain way, making it challenging to reproduce consistently.

2. The scenario primarily deals with content issues (e.g., the types of videos shown — aggressive controversial content, memes, etc.) rather than functional features or enhancements that could improve the app's operation or user interface.

3. The scenario description does not specify a cross-application issue; it appears to be focused on a single app.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility of the scenario**: The scenario described does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature, nor does it indicate a fixed interface where the issue consistently occurs. The phrase "buries individual users' posts and any hashtags" is vague and could imply a broad set of circumstances or problems that may not be easily reproducible in a fixed scenario. Without further detail, it's unclear if the issue happens consistently or under specific conditions.

2. **Feature relevance**: The scenario describes an issue related to how content is displayed, specifically the "burial" of users' posts and hashtags. While this is related to the functionality of the app, it is not a clear enhancement or feature designed to improve the user experience. Instead, it suggests a bug or an undesirable behavior (i.e., hiding content), which is typically considered a content-related problem or a usability issue.

3. **Cross-application**: The scenario does not suggest anything related to multiple apps, and it seems to pertain to a single app's functionality. However, the overall vagueness and lack of specifics prevent a clear determination that it is strictly app-specific. 

Given these factors, the scenario does not fully meet the criteria for reproducibility and relevance to improving the app's function.

Reason: The scenario described does not meet the first criteria entirely. While it mentions a specific application feature (the feed or set of reels), the automatic refresh upon returning to the app might not be a fixed interface behavior and can vary depending on how the app is designed or functions across different scenarios or user interactions. Additionally, the problem could be related to device-specific behaviors or settings, which introduces variability in reproducibility. Therefore, the first point about being a fixed interface that does not appear randomly is not fully satisfied.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario does not specify a particular application page or feature interface within Instagram that consistently displays a pause button. It merely notes a discrepancy when switching accounts, which may not be reproducible across all users or situations.  
2. The issue described is related to the user interface experience, but the lack of a pause button when switching accounts seems to be a functional inconsistency rather than a clear functional enhancement or essential feature to improve user experience.  
3. The description does not imply any cross-application actions or conditions that would invalidate the scenario based on your criteria.  

Overall, the scenario lacks specificity regarding a consistent feature or interface, and the described user experience may vary, making it not entirely reproducible.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempting to log out of an account on Instagram and being asked if the user wants to save their login details; even after selecting 'no,' the app still saves the login details.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly? In addition, the features mentioned in the scenario should not be those suggested by the user for addition, as this indicates that the app does not currently include these features.2. The feature described by the scenario is helpful in improving application functions and enhancing user experience, and are not content-related issues, such as "inaccurate content", "too many ads", "ads cannot be turned off", etc.3.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described, where Instagram asks if the user wants to save their login details and then saves them even after selecting 'no,' is potentially reproducible and refers to a specific function within the app. However, it does not clearly specify if this is a fixed interface issue or a result of random occurrences or bugs. Additionally, while this issue pertains to user experience improvement, it overlaps with being a cross-application situation since saving login details could possibly involve system-level permissions or functions not specific to Instagram alone. Lastly, while the scenario may not relate to the content, ad-related, or visual interface issues, the explanation does not make it explicitly clear that all three outlined conditions are fully met without exception.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Skip to a certain section on a reel without the video freezing.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario appears to be related to a potential issue with the app's video playback feature specifically when skipping to a certain section of a reel. However, the description does not clarify whether this feature is a fixed interface or if it appears randomly. Although skipping within a video is a common feature in many video apps, the comment does not explicitly state that this functionality exists in the app and is malfunctioning, implying it could also be a suggested feature addition. Additionally, it’s unclear whether the freezing occurs due to a device-specific issue or app-specific issue. Since the criteria require that the feature is a fixed interface of the application and not suggested for addition, and these elements are not definitively clear in the scenario, it doesn't fully meet all the criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The layout feature is not working properly after updating Instagram, and it gets blank after selecting images.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario mentions that the layout feature is "not working properly" after updating Instagram and that it "gets blank after selecting images." However, it does not specify a particular page, widget, or feature in a fixed context within the app. The problem described is more of a functional issue, which could potentially occur randomly depending on factors like the image selection process. Therefore, it does not describe a specific, reproducible issue tied to a fixed interface or feature.

2. **Feature relevance**: The issue seems related to the layout functionality, which is a core feature of the app and relevant to its user experience, rather than content-related concerns. This part of the scenario meets the second criterion.

3. **Cross-application context**: The scenario does not mention anything that would suggest it involves behavior from other apps or services, and it clearly describes an issue occurring within Instagram. Hence, this part is satisfied.

Given that point 1 about reproducibility is not fully met, the answer is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The app flags the user's page for showing too much skin, despite similar content from other users not being flagged.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves a content-related issue, specifically the app's flagging system for inappropriate content. This is not directly related to a feature that improves functionality or enhances user experience, but rather concerns content moderation, which is not applicable for the evaluation criteria outlined.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario describes a challenge with linking a Facebook page with an Instagram account, which involves cross-application functionality, as it requires interaction between both the Facebook and Instagram apps. This violates point 3 since the scenario cannot be cross-application for it to be reproducible.  
2. Although linking accounts could enhance user experience by integrating features, the issue in question does not pertain to content-related problems and meets the second point.  
3. There is no indication in the scenario that this issue occurs randomly or involves a feature suggested by users, suggesting it may relate to fixed interface aspects of the apps involved, thus aligning partially with point 1. However, the cross-application aspect still overrides this conformity.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Difficulty navigating the many settings, with some important aspects of user controls being hidden.Please judge: 1.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described mentions difficulty in navigating settings and hidden user controls, but it does not specify a particular application page or specific widget/feature. Without knowing exactly which settings or controls are difficult to navigate, the scenario lacks the specificity needed to determine whether the issue is reproducible. Additionally, the comment does not confirm whether these navigation issues consistently appear due to a fixed interface, nor does it provide insight into whether this is a new feature suggestion or a current issue. Therefore, not all criteria are met for the scenario to be reproducible as per your listed points.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described, where a user is unable to access their Instagram account after losing their password, is not something that is "reproducible" in a typical sense of interacting with an app. This is because forgetting a password and not having a way to recover it (like using email, phone number verification, or another form of password recovery provided by Instagram) is more related to user actions and account recovery options rather than a fixed "interface" issue or "scenario" within the app itself that can be consistently recreated. Moreover, password loss and account recovery are not tied to a specific widget or feature that appears randomly; it is more of a user error or security feature issue. Additionally, while improving account recovery processes might enhance user experience, the scenario doesn't strictly fall under app functional improvements in the same sense as fixing a bug or improving UI design.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves users creating a new account with a new password after losing access to their previous account. While this scenario might be related to account management and password recovery processes, it does not specify a particular application page, widget, or fixed interface feature. The process of creating a new account is a general feature available in most applications and is not unique to a specific scenario described in the user's comment. Additionally, the comment does not provide detailed steps or specific application elements involved, making it unclear if it is reproducible in the manner described. Moreover, the scenario seems to describe a general feature rather than suggesting an enhancement or addressing a specific application interface component.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an issue with posting a video or Boomerang to the story and indicates a fixed interface issue likely related to a specific application feature (posting stories). However, without knowing the specific app and whether this issue is a known fixed interface or a randomly occurring issue, it is difficult to determine if the scenario is reproducible. Additionally, since the specific page/widget of the application is not mentioned in detail, it doesn't fully meet the first point's requirement. The described issue does pertain to app functionality rather than content, satisfying point two. The provided scenario does specify issues occurring when the app is started normally, satisfying point three. However, given the uncertainty about the fixed interface requirement in point one, not all points are conclusively met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario "Can't use a GIF in the story" does not specify a specific application page or a definitive feature that exists within the app. It suggests that the app does not currently support the use of GIFs in stories, which indicates this is a feature request rather than an issue with an existing feature. Since the app does not include this functionality based on the scenario, point 1 is not met.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario does not meet the first point. While the issue seems to pertain to a specific feature (posting videos, Boomerangs, or GIFs to the story), it is not clear if the problem lies within a specific application page or widget. Additionally, the issue might be related to changes made in the app update, which suggests a potential variability that does not represent a fixed interface of the application. Moreover, without further information, we cannot definitively say the behavior appears consistently or randomly for the user.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:After opening Instagram, the user can only scroll through their feed for 2 minutes before it stops scrolling.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described involves Instagram's feed scrolling functionality, which typically operates in a consistent manner and should be a fixed interface of the application. Users generally scroll through their feed without interruption, so this suggests that the feed should scroll continuously rather than stopping after 2 minutes, indicating potentially reproducible behavior. However, the problem may not be reliably reproducible because it does not detail consistent conditions under which the issue occurs or specify if it appears only after particular actions are taken within the app. Furthermore, the scenario does not indicate whether it is linked to specific content or ads, nor does it suggest content-related issues. The scenario indeed does not imply cross-application problems or issues in a minimized or background state, meeting some of the stated criteria, but without confirmation that stopping occurs consistently in a set, reproducible way and not randomly, it does not fully satisfy all the outlined parameters.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario may not be reproducible because it does not specify a specific application page, widget, or feature within the app. It simply mentions the inability to overlay text or stickers on story templates without referring to the specific template or steps involved, leaving room for ambiguity about the context or conditions under which this issue is encountered. Additionally, it's unclear whether this issue is consistent across all devices or versions of the app, making it difficult to determine if it's a fixed interface problem or an issue that appears randomly.

2. While the feature of overlaying text or stickers is likely intended to enhance user experience by allowing more customization and creativity, the lack of specificity about when and where this issue occurs makes it challenging to identify whether this is a genuine functional shortcoming or a feature not currently offered by the app.

3. It's unclear if the issue described is specific to just one application or potentially a misunderstanding about how this feature is supposed to function across different apps that offer similar functionalities. The scenario doesn't clearly indicate it's a cross-application issue, leaving this aspect uncertain.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:  
1. The scenario describes a problem with Stories and Reels freezing, which may or may not be a reproducible issue. Freezing can sometimes be random due to various factors such as network connectivity or device performance, making it not necessarily a fixed interface issue.  
2. While freezing affects the user experience, the focus here seems to be on a performance issue rather than improving app functions or enhancing user experience in terms of feature improvement.  
3.

NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not specific enough to be reproducible as it does not mention a specific application page or widget/feature. It only describes a general issue (freezing) that may not consistently occur at a fixed interface.  
2. The freezing issue, while detrimental to user experience, is indeed a functional problem but the scenario lacks specification necessary for targeted reproduction and improvement, which makes it challenging for developers to address directly based on this description alone.  
3. The scenario does not indicate that the freezing issue occurs in cross-application scenarios, nor does it specify the state of the app beyond normal start, which would generally be okay, but without a specific interface or feature being implicated, it doesn't meet all criteria for a 'YES'.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described in the user's comment involves a "send to" list with a random order, which could potentially be affected by variable factors such as app updates, user settings, or integration with other apps. Since the issue might not be a fixed interface problem and could vary based on different variables (e.g., contact lists, cloud sync features), it might not be predictably reproducible under controlled conditions. Additionally, without specific information about which app or feature leads to the randomization, it could also be categorized as a cross-application issue if it involves data from multiple sources.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  

1. **Reproducibility**: While the scenario describes a specific feature related to loading friends' stories, it doesn't clarify whether this issue always occurs under the same conditions or if it's random. Without specific steps to consistently reproduce the problem (e.g., network conditions, app version, time of day), it's difficult to confirm that the scenario is a fixed interface issue that does not appear randomly.

2. **Feature Improvement**: The scenario involves the functionality of viewing friends' stories, which is indeed a critical feature of many social apps. Improving this feature could enhance user experience by ensuring smoother interaction and content access. This part meets the requirement.

3. **Cross-Application**: The scenario does not provide information that suggests it occurs due to interactions with other apps or in varied app states (e.g., small window). It implies the issue occurs when the app is used normally, meeting this criterion.

However, due to the uncertainty around reproducibility, the overall assessment is NO.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:New messages do not show up until the page is manually refreshed.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: 

1. The scenario is reproducible as it describes a specific application behavior where new messages do not appear until the page is manually refreshed. This is a fixed interface issue that would consistently occur under the same conditions, indicating it's not a random occurrence or a feature suggestion but an existing feature behaving in a specific manner.

2. The feature described is directly related to application functionality, specifically in how it handles message updates. Improving this functionality by ensuring messages appear without needing manual refreshes would enhance user experience by providing real-time updates, which is vital for communication applications.

3. The scenario is application-specific. It does not mention conditions involving the app being in a small window, background, or floating status. It refers to the app being used in its normal state, implying the behavior affects the normal, intended use of the app.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes an attempt to use a feature ("scheduling posts") that is not available, suggesting the feature is missing rather than malfunctioning. This indicates a feature not currently included in the app, which violates point 1 about reproducibility.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: The scenario describes a specific feature of the application, which is the "Reels" topic, and notes its absence on one profile while present on another. This issue is reproducible as it pertains to a fixed interface of the application where the feature should consistently appear across profiles. The feature is not a suggestion for addition, but rather a reported inconsistency. It is a functional issue related to the app's performance and usability, not a content-related problem. Additionally, the scenario does not occur due to the app being in a minimized or background state, as it involves normal usage conditions when the app is fully launched. This issue is contained within the app itself and is not related to cross-application behavior.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:Attempt to send bug reports, but the app does not allow it.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible?

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario described ("Attempt to send bug reports, but the app does not allow it") is vague and does not specify a particular page, feature, or widget in the app. Without more detailed information about which part of the app the issue occurs in (e.g., a specific report submission screen or button), it is not clear if this scenario is reproducible in a fixed interface.  
2. **Feature Relevance**: The scenario does not suggest a feature enhancement, but it does describe a functional issue—being unable to send bug reports—which could be relevant for improving the app's functionality. This satisfies the condition of enhancing user experience.  
3. **Cross-application Issue**: The scenario is app-specific and doesn’t seem to involve cross-application interactions. However, since the issue isn’t described with enough detail about how it happens within the app (e.g., after clicking a specific button), this condition is not fully clarified.

Because the lack of specific information makes the scenario unclear in terms of reproducibility, the overall answer is "NO."I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
**NO**  
**Reason**:  

1. **Reproducibility**: The scenario does not describe a specific application page or widget that can be easily identified or consistently replicated. The "not interested" button is a feature, but the exact behavior described — where the same or similar content continues to appear despite using the feature — may be influenced by factors such as the recommendation algorithm or other dynamic elements that cannot be fixed to a specific interface or action in a predictable way.

2. **Helpful feature**: While this issue is related to the user experience (i.e., ensuring the "not interested" function works properly), it is more of a bug or flaw in the content filtering mechanism rather than a feature that improves or enhances the app's functions. However, this would likely be considered part of content management rather than a "content-related issue," so this part is acceptable. 

3. **Cross-application**: The problem described seems to be app-specific and tied to the user's interaction with the "not interested" feature in a specific app context. It does not indicate an issue that would happen across different apps, so this part is met.

Therefore, due to the lack of clarity and reproducibility in the scenario (point 1), the overall answer is **NO**.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described is cross-application because it involves the interaction between Instagram and the device's operating system (pressing the lock button affects the playback). Additionally, the scenario might not be specific to an Instagram feature or page that consistently appears, since the behavior might vary with different videos or device settings.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

You need to answer:
1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason:  
1. The scenario is not necessarily reproducible. The issue where Instagram keeps logging the user out can occur randomly due to reasons like bugs, server issues, or network problems that may be difficult to consistently reproduce. It does not describe a specific application page, widget, or fixed interface interaction that can be directly followed to recreate the problem.  
2. The issue described is related to user experience and app functionality, as it affects account stability and app usability, but whether this contributes to enhancing user experience depends on resolving existing bugs rather than improving or adding new features.  
3. The scenario is app-specific and seems to occur when the app is used normally, which aligns with the criteria, but the unpredictability and lack of specificity impede the fulfillment of all criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a potential issue with being logged out after changing the password multiple times, but it lacks specifics about the interface or feature involved. It doesn't detail whether the issue is linked to a fixed part of the app or how the feature functions in a set context, which makes it hard to judge if it meets the reproducibility criteria.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario described does not specify a particular feature or widget of the app that is consistently associated with the issue. The issue of posts and videos repeating could be related to content refresh mechanisms, which might involve several components like app caching, feed-loading algorithms, or server-side content distribution, making it less clear if the problem lies in a specific, reproducible aspect of the app's interface. Additionally, the scenario may depend on dynamic content from other user's accounts, complicating reproduction within a controlled environment.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

YES  
Reason: The scenario of needing to refresh to receive new text messages is specific enough to be reproduced, as it likely involves the main messaging page or feature of the app. This scenario describes a fixed interface problem, not a random or situational issue. It is relevant to application functionality and directly affects user experience, rather than being about content or ads. Finally, the issue described is specific to the app's normal operation and not related to the app running in a small window or background.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
YES  
Reason: The scenario meets all three points:

1. **Reproducibility**: The user scenario describes a specific issue with the app feature regarding the use of photos or videos from an SD card for creating Reels or stories. This is a fixed interface issue rather than a random occurrence, and the scenario is not suggesting a new feature.

2. **Feature Enhancement**: The ability to use media from an SD card is an essential feature that enhances the functionality of the app by allowing users to create Reels and stories, thus improving user experience.

3. **Single-application Issue**: This scenario is specific to the app and does not involve cross-application usage. It describes an issue occurring within the normal functioning of the app rather than in a minimized or background state.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason:...
NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a specific application feature (shuffle-only feature) that is likely reproducible because it is a consistent functionality of the app, and not a random occurrence. It does not suggest adding a new feature. However, the scenario implies a content-related issue concerning functionality (inability to add songs to the queue), but does not mention improving functionality in a broader sense unrelated to app content or user interface.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

Reason: The scenario described in the user comment, "The lyrics are never shown," may not necessarily be a fixed interface issue as it lacks specificity. Without knowing more about which page or feature of the app the comment refers to, it's unclear if this issue applies consistently across all users or if it may occur randomly due to various factors.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.

NO  
Reason: The scenario "The lyrics are never shown" suggests that there is a feature (showing lyrics) that is supposed to be available in the app, but it is not functioning as expected.  

1. While the scenario seems to be describing a specific feature (lyrics display), the information provided is not sufficient to determine if this is a consistently reproducible issue across a fixed interface. The phrase "never shown" does not specify a particular condition or page within the app where this problem consistently occurs, making it unclear if it's a reproducible scenario.

2. Displaying lyrics is likely a key feature of the app and essential for improving functionality and user experience. Hence, this point is met.

3. The comment does not specify conditions such as small window mode or background operation, but rather implies that the issue occurs during normal app usage. However, without reference to a specific interface or consistent condition, it's difficult to confirm point one, impacting the assessment of point three as a specific reproducible scenario.

Therefore, not all three points are fully satisfied, leading to a "NO" conclusion.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps. The following is a scenario exracted from a user comment:The new shuffle-only feature prevents adding songs into the queue.Please judge: 1. Is the scenario reproducible? Does the scenario describe a specific application page or a specific application widget/feature and the scenario is a fixed interface of the application and does not appear randomly?

NO  
Reason: The scenario describes a shuffle-only feature preventing the addition of songs to the queue. While it potentially describes a specific application feature, the problem does not specify whether this is an existing, fixed feature of the application or if it might be a suggested change by the user. Thus, it's unclear if the scenario is reproducible based on the current application interface and functionality. Additionally, the scenario might relate to a design choice rather than a technical problem that could be improved for user experience.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

NO  
Reason: The scenario "The lyrics are never shown" does not clearly specify a particular application page or widget/feature where the issue occurs. It lacks a detailed description of when and where the lyrics are supposed to be displayed, making it difficult to determine if the scenario is specific and reproducible. Additionally, it is possible that the user is requesting a feature that is not currently present in the app, which implies that the app does not include this functionality rather than it being a defect. Moreover, without information indicating that the feature is indeed expected to be present and function correctly under normal operation, it doesn't fully meet the criteria of a reproducible issue that can be investigated for improvement of application functions.I am trying to reproduce the problem scenarios described in user reviews of mobile apps to help developers maintain and improve the apps.

1)If all three points are met,output 'YES, otherwise output 'NO'.You should show reasons.
Output format:
YES/NO
Reason:...
NO  
Reason: While the scenario describes a specific feature (shuffle-only) that may directly affect user experience by preventing songs from being added to the queue, which could be helpful for improving the app, it lacks clarity regarding whether this issue appears consistently and is reproducible on a specific application page or widget. Additionally, it is not certain if this feature exists in the app in its current form, as sometimes comments may suggest new features. Therefore, it does not fully meet the first criterion for reproducibility as specified.
