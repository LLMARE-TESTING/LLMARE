Not having to Hold your finger on a tab for like 20 minutes to make an image on your video go from beginning to end or whatever even if you want to have ten or twenty or however many images added to audio... Why isn't there an option to select imagine duration... As opposed to a line you drag... It's like the image feature was designed for 30 second videos or something.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi! This is a great app for editing. There's no watermark, and if you want to upload it easily, you can press the little arrow thing at the top. It's alot easier to edit because there's also templates. I've been using this app for roughly about 3 months, it's so helpful! A slight problem I have is when I have to switch between my old phone and this one. The videos don't transfer, and just disappear. You don't have to fix it! I can find my way around. In fact, you can add multiple scenes in one!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has been such a good and easy video editor but recently it has been extremely laggy and slow. I'm not sure but I think it came from the latest update because since then, videos are taken forever to export. Currently, I'm exporting a 25 seconds clip but it has taken 10 minutes so far. I'm just hoping you can get it fixed asap because I rely on this app so much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At the start, it's a wonderful editing app to use, but as im going on. It's not been great, there are a few problems I've been experiencing alot. 1) Whenever I try to miniscreen capcut on my device, it doesn't work and my device gets frozen and I have to restart the device. 2) There has been way too much lag, it's so hard to edit when it's takes so long to recover the lag issues. 3) Whenever using a textbox, sometimes the previous textbox I wrote, it's writing is on the text im using."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cap Cut has been easy to get used to. But it does have its limitations. Videos that you edit with CapCut cannot be added to another project, they cause CapCut to run painfully slow. The stickers and overlays are great, but they lack an interactive search function, and more to choose from. And it would be really great if you could export only a selected clip in the timeline as a new video resource. (The clip could be trimmed or have additional effects on them)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great editor ON MOBILE. On pc on the other hand, honestly, it's terrible, the clips won't load,it will slow down without reason and you can't speed it up. DEVS, PLEASE FIX. To make videos on gopro, it's easier to put the videos on to your pc rather that Mobil, so it's better to edit videos on pc, so, please fix. Also PLEASE LOOK DEVS AWSOME IDEA you know the mask feature, can you make an option so that you can sraw your own mask, or at least add a few more shapes üòâ. If you do this THX"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't really like the video quality function. HD and especially UHD makes faces look ugly. Everything else looks brilliant, but faces are mostly ugly, especially in video. However, to be fair, sometimes faces also look well. It seems a small detail, which can be neglected. But in my opinion, human faces are the most important detail. If they look ugly, the whole picture or video is just a piece of junk for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing free app for editing with cool features (although you have to pay for pro now for the majority of capcut) but I cannot give 4 or 5 stars. It has lags and has lots of bugs and glitches. The worst one I've had is when I try to make key frames to move images. When I try do this it affects other key frames and changes their adjustments. It really needs fixing and CapCut should have regular checks. If this happens I may give it 4 or 5 stars. Overall, the app is still decent to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an excellent app, it has a wide selection of tools to use within the app itself, this contains no ads which is great. You can use templates from other people who have amazing talents at editing, or you can just edit a video or clip on your own. I personally use both but if I had to choose I would edit on my own. It's so simple and that's why I love it. Sometimes it does lag and kick me off, but that's only every so often. I 100% recommended this app if you love editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Could be amazing if it didn't freeze up to a point of not being able to use the editing features. Every time I cut a video, it has problems lagging while playing back the video. Pausing in between transitions even if there is no transition. It's impossible to edit anything with unless you just keep the video as it is and use the other features but.. good luck if you need to trim anything. I have a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra. None of my other apps do this :0"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't use the PC version. I've been pouring hours into a video and the music syncs use the speed feature and the speed curve feature, and I have to customize it, but it always resets the speed no matter how much I save nothing will fix this bug and its one of the most annoying things I've ever dealt with in an editing software, if someone knows I fix for this I'd love to know, but until then I'm not using this program probably ever again. It has some really good features, but this is too much"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very nice when it works, but it's very buggy. I'm getting my sounds duplicated throughout my videos and my longer music audios dissapearing so I can't edit them even though I can still hear them in my video. I've tried updating and restarting the app but it hasnt fixed anything. As a pro user I really hope this gets fixed soon so I can give a proper rating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like this app it's very good but I have one problem. Whenever I try to cutout pictures and use the custom cut. It keeps erroring and it gets placed on a different side of the picture instead of where I drew it. Until this gets fixed I'm leaving 3 stars. Good app but very buggy Edit: it has gotten even worse, now I can barley cutout. Also, most sound effects now are terrible, before they were good, now I can't even find what I'm looking for."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"9/22: I really like the app! I've been using it for 2 years and it's really good and convenient (and it's actually really good especially because it's free). However, alot of features are laggy and work for everyone but me. The motion blur is laggy and just fades instead of actually doing motion blur. I've tried lots of things in an attempt to fix it but nothing works. Please fix this! 4/24: motion blur works fine and app is rlly good!! no flaws, not that ive experienced. adding vip is sad tho-"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's WAS great but it won't let me use it, every time I open it it gives me a security notice and says to download the most recent iteration of it in the app store. Thing is!!! That is the most recent. It's fully updated as well! I've switched phones and this problem happened on both of them. Capcut I have to make videos somehow!!!!??!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to use. Smoother than Tiktok to create videos. I feel that too many things are available for Pro, such as some of the AI voices, which are the same as Tiktok, yet they are all free on there unlike Capcut. Sometimes, when selecting an AI voice, it doesn't not load, and I have to use the Apply to All option to get around it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love capcut and always have but just today I was editing a video for YouTube when randomly the audio got corrupted. the voices and sounds sound like they were put through a robot voice filter. I wasn't editing anything yet just reviewing the footage. I tried hitting the undo button but because I didn't touch anything it didn't have anything to undo. I looked back at the videos in my camera roll and they're completely fine. it's capcut. pls fix this I love this app very disappointed rn
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good editor, however with the new pro addition, everything is basically pro. New effects, features, and ever some things like motion blur is now a pro feature. Furthermore, capcut can't seem to run anything over 500mb of storage. The app starts to lag heavily, and for some reason even lagged with 1080p footage, which at this point should be default, and should be best to run. Don't use if you have really any intenton of making a somewhat decent edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE, after so long using without issues it started failing, tried using it alone, emptying the phone memory, re-installing, NOTHING helped. The images don't load, the videos don't load, you can't see what you're doing and it doesn't allow you to split or do anything, it's lagging horribly and it has become useless. I'm uninstalling it till there's some good fixing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Let me report an inconvenience that is happening in use. There is no problem with short videos, but when making a lot of clips and long videos, if i make a mistake and use pro mode, it cannot be done during export. I also did not buy pro mode, so it is very inconvenient to search for where in the video I used pro mode to cancel pro mode. That's why it would be more convenient if you add a feature that makes it easy to find which video clip has been used in pro mode.Thank You."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"love this app! I use this for editing. However, one time i re-installed capcut because the app is so glitchy to the point its crashing. So i reinstalled it. And once its done installing it always keeps saying ‚ÄúApp not Installed‚Äù i tried many times it just wont install and i have to wait for 24 FREAKING hours to install it back. And the fact that almost half of the effects, things and functions in capcut are all pro. Not trying to be ‚Äúunfair‚Äù its just the editors need cooperation too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Highly don't recommend. It was a good app for editing at start but on day I got no connection in capcut even tho I had excellent and full connection. Please fix this capcut. I need to finish an edit. It's been happening for a month and it is not accessible. I tried alight motion but capcut is wayy easier. Please fix this by a week or 2...other than that, app is good for beginners, wonderful templates, good for animations, etc. if this glitch was fixed it would be appreciated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An honest review. I've been using capcut since 2021, and it's become terrible. 1: pro. Almost every good effect is locked behind pro, the good features, they are locked behind pro. It's annoying :( 2: ads. They added ads, again, very annoying. 3: templates. Please stop pushing them so hard- if we want to use templates, cool. If we don't, don't force us to us them. 4: updates. Adding updates no one wants. You are making the app worse- 5: text. Pls add the old text system back. Let us save text."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely recommend this app for editing any video, but I have been getting problems with it recently. I have finished WEEKS of my effort on a video but now it won't let me export it, it's only 2 or 3 minutes and I am trying to export it in a low code rate, frame rate, and resulotion, but NOTHING I working! Please help me-I really need this video"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love that they offer filters without watermarks & features like video sound extracting for free. I hope they would make ways for creating an editing tool that would let me 'cut from here', cut from the start, cut to the end, & also features that would easily let me jump to the last clip of my videos or to first part of my videos or to any video in the set of clips I also hope they would offer free decent voice effects like that of real persons other than my favorite 'trickster'."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After coming back, new features are cool but my disappointment is immeasurable when seeing that they made a subscription for everything. Everything and I mean everything back then was free, I understand the need to make money but damnnnnn... this as much as a streaming service, if not more. I'm just absolutely flabbergasted. The fact buffering still exists on mobile......... Don't get me wrong, it's still a great editing app but damn it fell off hard. Real review is honestly 2-2.5"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New problem: Whenever I put an audio from CapCut and put it in and I go and press the audio, it would not let you go to voice change. I can't believe they updated that, and it's very disappointingly awful. Like, what are you supposed to do when you want it to echo?!?!? I like this app very much, but this is an update that got me saying, ""exuse me?!"". This should be fixed now, pls"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for editing videos, combining them and more. You can use templates and edits from other makers, so like you use their edits with your own pictures/videos. But theres one down thing, you have to pay for the PRO things, and I believe that it used to be free? Like u only had to watch a video or smt but idk. It doesn't bother me that much because theirs a lot of free things that are great. Highly recommend this app üëç"

I've done everything they've asked and provided all necessary information, even went as far as to restore my purchase and the issue was still not resolved. I'm missing out on days of a subscription that I've paid for and feel I should be able to access. Haven't had this horrible of an experience with a subscription service before. Please fix ASAP"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app helped me with editing heavily, I don't mind about it not being accessible to the premium options without premium and tiny bugs. But there is this small issue, every time I make a video edited, it saves. But when I delete it for more space on my phone, the bytes stay for some reason. If you could fix this, may you please do so?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd rate CapCut five stars for its intuitive interface, making video editing a breeze. Its extensive range of features allows for creative freedom, from basic edits like trimming and cropping to advanced effects like transitions and filters. The app's simplicity doesn't sacrifice functionality; it offers a robust set of tools for both beginners and experienced editors alike. The seamless integration of music and sound effects enhances the overall editing experience, elevating videos and more!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Basically useless now. Used to be good a couple years ago, now literally all of the transitions are pro, and the app has become completely unusable for those on mobile. Can't even export things to laptop properly. Not to mention, it scammed me once. If you want to get an editing app, don't get capcut. Every time I've used it I've gotten severely annoyed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This App Is Amazing!! Capcut was my first editing app and I am so happy that it was, I first heard about capcut from my friends and thankfully I tried it! Honestly, sometimes it lags and frustrates me but overall its a really good app. Theres been a few time when the audio doesnt work or ends early for example the audio is 3 minutes long but the audio stops at 2 minutes. That really sucks, cuz I would have to find another audio because even if I reset capcut the audio would end early. Nice app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I've used it for what feels like forever, and I can't imagine making videos without it...but it keeps telling me to redownload it, and deletes some of my videos, I was wondering if that's just a tech problem? It keeps saying to download it in the official app store, and that there's a security problem, so I was wondering if you could fix that...also the app store won't open through the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great editing app. But when I got to download things all the time. It bugs out to the point it crashes my phone. My phones processor has the snapdragon 660. Loads of ram. This shouldn't be an issue. It's why I won't pay for pro ü§≠. This should be much better. The music selection should be much better. There are a lot of things that This app can do better. Self taught in editing, been at it for 8 months. I've been comparing the comp. Just used to capcut. But tired of the short comings."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As an editor who has been using this app for almost two years, this is a great app for newer editors or editors who are learning and exploring how to edit. This app has changed SO much over the past year or so, one big thing i would say is that it was better two years ago than it is now. I constantly have to delete it and reinstall it because of glitches, slo-mo is never smooth anymore, EVERYTHING is turning pro. If you're looking for a better version of this app, use the computer version."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For some reason, recently I can no longer access CapCut due to it telling me my app is not secure and that I have to update to the latest version. Doing so directs me to a play store page that does absolutely nothing when I tap install. I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but it doesn't work. Edit: it is still not working and I don't want to lose my projects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Probably the best free editing app on mobiles is Capcut. I just love it. But i have an old Android 10 phone. I can do some editing but when it comes to slow mo. It's just so laggy even with smooth slow mo. And my phone starts heating so i can't make better edits. I also cannot use many effects at the same edit cuz it starts lagging again & again and the beat get misplaced after export. I just want the devs to optimize it for low end phones so it works easily on low end phones. Hope U take action
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just uninstalled. It became so buggy unusable hence time wasting. Reverse and smooth slow are not working together. They keep cancelling eachother. Reverse takes forever no matter what the size of the clip. Consumes a lot of battery. If the app is left open it won't allow phone to go to sleep mode hence resulting the runout of the battery. Another thing is search function in audio finder is case sensitive which is no practical and difficult to find exact track if you have its different versions
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app overall, and I enjoyed using it for its wide range of features and user-friendly interface. However, the lag during editing was more pronounced than I expected, which made the process a bit frustrating at times. While the app is capable of producing excellent results, the slow response can disrupt the workflow, especially when working on more complex projects. I hope future updates can address this issue to provide a smoother experience."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's very glitchy, to the point when you download your project, theres always one clip of the video stuck on for a view second, + to make it worse when you tried to make it smooth it's always glitchy and some black part around your video when you tried to make it slow and smooth I expect this app is good but when it updates, i can't use it properly now without data and having to deal with glitches every video i edit (I'm a editor on tiktok) this app is quite frustrating to use every edit i do."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Has been a great app overall, but recently has been stalling when I try to play through a draft I'm editing. The video will drag and the audio delays so it isn't synced, and then a few seconds later it will crash. This has been my consistent experience the past few days. I've tried just about everything including deleting and reinstalling the app. Now I get a pop-up encouraging me to download the desktop version to ""avoid crashes,"" which shouldn't be happening anyways."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: This is probably one of the best video editing apps out there. It is very precise when trimming clips, tons of free options to choose from adding text, ai captions, stickers, transferring between each clip, video effects, huge selection of music and sound effects to choose from. BIGGEST CON: They like to delete your videos. No reason specified, no warning. Make sure to save a copy of your work every single time! I've lost countless home videos of me and my kids and content videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is great, but there's one small bug. So basically I'm just addimg clips and stuff and then all of the sudden, boom the screen turns black. if you don't know what I mean I mean, so I'm just editing then the part that shows the stuff to u so u can watch it turns black. I get so frustrated cuz I wanna watch my vid so re-open the app then it does it again in the same spot. Please fix this. I would've gave a higher rating but the bug is really, REALLY bad."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I regret updating this app. A lot of things that were free are now either gone or under the Pro option. I liked this app because I don't have the money to drop on this app for Pro and it gave me a lot of great free choices for editing. Don't forget the lag and video/audio not syncing properly and the fact that things get moved around a lot and you can never find what you're looking for.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Only two problems: 1) Teleprompter doesn't allow me to record in landscape. It doesn't make sense since TikTok now wants us to make videos in landscape. 2) Doesn't allow me to use the bluetooth wireless keypad on my selfie stick to start and stop the recording process. I have to physically click on my phone for both operations. It sucks. Otherwise, I have no problem with the app. In fact, it's been my default editor and recorder for a while now"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not so great. Editing is fairly easy and intuitive, and there are lots of features. However, when I tried to upload (or is it download? The arrow is pointing up) it stated I was using a Pro feature and required a subscription, even though I wasn't. I triple checked and deleted all the basic transitions to be sure. No Super-large Spot was used in the making of my video. So no bueno there, amigos. Sorry. For $18 more a month, I can just subscribe to Adobe Premiere Pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app for certain things but it has some big problems, like sometimes l' be editing a video and the whole track turns dark? What's up with that? And whenever that happens I have to restart. It's not nice when that happens. Theres also to constant freezes when I put effects it makes it offbeat and ruins it. But, without all that? It's a great app with amazing and outstanding templates created by talented people and capcut makes it all come to life and it's great on that note"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using this app for video editing, however, I've come across a recurring issue recently. When I export a project, the video has no audio for the last few seconds. I've checked CapCut, the audio is still there, I've even tried re-exporting the project, that didn't work. I hope this can be looked into, as it's been bugging me for about 2 weeks now. Thank you in advance! :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some of the auto captions templates suck. Once auto captions have been generated, the templates don't allow you to edit the texts. For example, after choosing one of the auto captions templates and tap on ""generate,"" text is generated, and that's nice. Unfortunately, the template doesn‚Äôt allow me to add more letters and exclamation marks, especially at the end of sentences."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a great app! Though it does have some flaws, it's a great alternative to using Alight Motion, Video Star, etc.. I do have quite a complaint, the reverse button. Before, (2021-mid 2022) the reverse button worked and did an awesome job, but when the big update/when you created capCut pro, the reverse button now glitches/stays stuck in frames. As an editor, this really annoys me, Ive searched the web, but I can't find a solution to fix it. Please fix this glitch!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I go to inspect a clip, the app starts controlling itself. When I do velocity, it freezes the entire video. When I do reverse, it starts glitching. And these are just some things broken in my app. I've honestly been using capcut for years, so I don't know why it's randomly broken. But I'm honestly tired of these errors all the time. I always check for updates, clear my cache, etc. But nothing works."

I love capcut!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Until the most recent update this was the most economical and uset friendly editing app out there imo. Now it's a mess. Reverse chops up anything you try to use it with, the, lag, despite having plenty of memory and storage space and no running background apps is making it almost impossible to accurately and precisely edit. Issues with sound lining up, minor bugs with beats settings, and it takes an ungodly amount of time to apply settings when added or on opening a project. All new issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing. I edit almost everything with it now. However, there's something I'd like to suggest. If there was an option to select an element's duration like inshot, it would be better. I have trouble while selecting the duration with my fingers, as for example, if I wanted some elements to have the same exact duration, I could barely do it. Lastly, some effects that are really high quality (whether in the effects list or the text animations) cause Capcut to lag whenever I'm reviewing my project."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I mean, it's a pretty good moble editing app. Like don't get me wrong, I really like it. Buuuut; ‚Ä¢its laggy ‚Ä¢all the pro stuff is reeeally pushed ‚Ä¢when you input an overlay with a transparent background, you might lose it. The apps background is black and the overlay is shown black as well, so it sucks. I wish there was a light mode or something to fix that issue. ‚Ä¢ + more annoying issues (but I can't include them all bc of the reviews character limit) Good editing app, but it can be annoying :/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lately, I have been having trouble while editing a few videos of mine. Once you import the video and start editing the app straight up, it delays the videos, making it almost impossible to keep track of what is first or last. It also affects the sound, making it very delayed. I overall love the app it's actually amazing and has a lot more potential to explode, but this, issue sure can be fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the pro update, my liking decreased. Im sure there are also many who experience this problem. After hours of editing, it won't let me export because im using a pro feature, enhanced voice. I did accidently use some, but i went through all my clips for 10 minutes straight removing ALL OF THEM. Since the feature is related to the audio, i decided to DELETE all of my audios and MUTE all of my clips. It still WON'T let me export. Please fix this. it's pissing me off."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A decent editor overall, but I'm having a lot of issues with dragging overlay pictures and videos. They don't appear to line up properly when I drag them, and sometimes they will disappear from the timelime but not the actual video. And sometimes the overlay I try to trim shows up as the wrong item. It would be nice if they could fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"ugh, it keeps bugging. everytime I try to use a effect I can't click on it and my capcut crashes, or even a text animation. also, when I try to reverse one of my clips it takes so long literally I sit and wait for almost 25 minutes just so the clip can reverse. and oh my god, also when I split one of the clips on the beat it doesn't go in place, even if I close the app and go back to the project, it still won't split the clip properly. the app also keeps freezing and it is so raging. fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Capcut, it really is great, but affer the last update when i open it it open on ""projects"" and not the normal home page, and theres no home button or back button, so there is no way for me to add videos to edit something new.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have two video editing programs on my laptop but Capcut on my phone does just about everything they do and a few key things they don't. In some ways, the mobil version is superior in my opinion or at the very least, much easier to use with much more intuitive functionality. Yes there are a few inevitable drawbacks (like features only on the mobil version that aren't on the PC(?!) and the mobil and PC versions not being connected at all say like Google Docs is, but overall, I still give it a 5"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps giving me a ""security notice"" every time I open it, saying my current version isn't secure and to download the latest versions from the playstore. This happened to me before, and I uninstalled the app and installed it again, and it worked temporarily. I lost all my projects because I uninstalled the app, even though I was logged into an account, and it really annoyed me. This glitch just started happening again, and I don‚Äôt want to lose my new projects. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't see the point of downloading such app as this one for editing. It used to be a decent app for users to freely edit but thanks to the bugs and useless updates, the effects and the animations were starting to lag and by the time I deleted and re-installed it, it would often say the app isn't secure every single TIME. Please for the love of God, Fix the goddamn app otherwise you're going to go down the edge with those lags and bugs. :/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I'm kinda annoyed on keep hanging/lagging whenever you add more effects it's getting worse, I've been waiting a long time for this to be fixed, I really hope they fixed this!! I rate this app 4 star because you can edit for free and all those effects you used in pag-eedit are incredible and fine, It's just great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First video editor app I've used, seems good enough, at least for a beginner like me, pretty simple to use, can cut clips to the length I want and add as many clips as I like to a video, extensive music library, can add text in different colours, adding pics to the videos and a lot more that I haven't even tried yet. I like it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Had an issue to start with but soon got fixed and is now really useful. It is more useful when I share my work with freinds since they really like my editing and they say its really entertaining to watch. This makes me feel good since I like editing and I really enjoy it. The only down part is when it comes up,you have used pro features pay to export ,and I've spent 1 hour just working out what it was and never found out. I gave up. Except for that, it is a really useful app to edit things on"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is great..but am having an issue with video Freeze don't save on device gallery. Sometimes i freeze clip just to edit the image on other apps, then come back to CapCut and finish my edit. But its not possible, then i have to export the unfinished edit, go to my gallery and take a screenshot of the image in the clip i need, editing on another app, then come back to CapCut...so stressful. Other editing apps have this feature. Please make it available on your app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good, and I would give 4 or 5 stars, but I wish they could find a way to save your drafts. After a sibling deleted the app as a joke, I reinstalled it, and I didn't know that upon deleting the app, also deletes all your drafts. I had multiple drafts that took me HOURS and they were all lost üò≠ so if there's any way to save the drafts, it'd be great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"ok, so-- as an editor, it's fine. It's not my first choice of editing app, because first off, the hue sucks, horrible. Second- there's no opacity for text.. Third, most of the effects are pro, which not everyone has money for, the effects are basically everything to the app, or so my friends say.. capcut is their first choice of editing app.. ""why?"" Idk. Anyway, it's a fine app I guess if you just use it for templates, they kinda also suck but it's alr- :'D"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to work so well, But now it just crashes and is extremely laggy. Whenever i try to add effects or texts they always lag and god forbid they go to the right place i want them to. It crashes, and doesnt export anything longer than 5 minutes, whenever im trying to export it just crashes after 90% and takes a long time to not even export! Dont use this if your planning to make long or quality videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Theres alot of problems with this app, Ive been using it for maybe 2 or more years but I'm not gonna lie its getting more and more buggier. For example: it freezes for me from time to time, And also the text animations stop working even when i try to click it sometimes the text is rlly annoying because sometimes it shows that its in the place that you want it to be but when you click on it, it goes back to where you first put it. Not to mention the ""pro"" system.. I really hope they can fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving this a one star because there is no basic feature to let people have a smooth text color transition, like say you want to transition your text color from lets say white to black. There is no feature to do that and it's super stupid and annoying to find a useless tutorial that DOES NOT WORK. Its also very annoying sometimes because it deletes your added text sometimes when you dont want it too and more. Its so annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updating my review... Video sounds are working until after I download them. When videos are downloaded, sometimes the video downloaded doesn't match the video I intended to download, colors are off and in negative polarity. Could be great but many links and features aren't working. I get ""failed to load"" messages. I tried to provide feedback within the app but that link failed as well."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I may have to delete this app. I downloaded it for the text to image ai backgrounds. The first time, I had no issues and was very happy with my photo but when I tried again, I kept getting a message it couldn't find what I was referencing. I tried all different photos and none worked like the first. Is this app a one hit wonder?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App is easy to use and its always my go to but oh my lord does it lag in editing if your video starts getting long. And this might just be a me problem but sometimes text just goes completely forward or backwards depending I try to place it happens with images and sound too Also they decided to remove the thing to let you drag an imagine length and if you reach the edge of your phone screen it would keep going now I have to pause every time I get to the edge and extend and keep doing that
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is one of the easiest ways to edit for a beginner! I love this app but one thing which I face alot is that if you delete the picture which you used for an edit will disappear. This was really sad since I made edits and videos which I liked alot but of course I accidentally deleted it. I don't think I have faced this problem in another editing app (not sure). If it had a saving feature for pictures or videos that would be so nice! Especially if it was one picture at a time.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app but after the last 2 updates something had to change which was the templates thing that are ready to use but when I opened it the older version was downloaded but I saw the latest version and it was the same (10.8.2) I unistalled it SEVEN TIMES the same annoying version -_- and there are also lots of bugs as opening the ""text to image"" feature and it tells me ~COULDN'T OPEN,TRY AGAIN~ I click on the try again pannel and it tells me again for several times even before updates."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is becoming bad day after day. The lags and bugs are unbearable and also the ads every 1 minute. Everything became pro. Also exportation takes forever. And it's been a year and I cannot export videos longer than 6 minutes. Also when I type a text and use autocorrect an additional word or letter adds and I cannot even delete it which causes me to delete the whole text I typed Please capcut if you can't improve at least don't make updates that makes the app worser
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing!!!! I love this app for editing videos, making videos, even just for fun. You can also watch little videos called temeplates for ideas to make stuff! There are also filters you can try on yourself, I personally like making myself an anime character, or a boy. It's just so fun! You can also download pictures from Google and make videos with them, you can even use audios! I love this app, I use it 24/7 definitely a recommendationüòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear developer, I am very disappointed after updating the current version of capcut. When I open it, a ""security notice"" pop up always appears and told me to download the latest version, even though I had uninstalled and reinstalled this application 4 times on Playstore, and it didn't change anything. I'm very sad because I can't edit videos like before. So please, make this application run normally as before üôèüèª. I use an Android device, Redmi Note 8"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using capcut, but I've run into an issue where it says that the app is not secure and I have to download its latest version in official app stores (which is for chromebook while I'm on my phone). I'm very unhappy at the moment. The problem is resolved now, but please make sure this can be avoided, and there have been many effects added that are specifically for pro users :/, can you add more for nonpro as well?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be a great app. Started being more serious with my editing and I noticed the first like 2-4 seconds it speeds up really fast then for about 5-6 seconds it plays in slow motion then plays normal. This is very annoying and very tedious to fix. I save it and it does the same thing as if I edited that way
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So I used to have a pretty good time editing, however today Capcut keeps giving me a notification that the current version is insecure and I need to redownload, so I click the button before it makes me sign into Google play 2-3 times before telling me ""Capcut will be installed on your device soon"". I can't do a single thing while the security notice is on the screen and it's starting to piss me off and it doesn't look like there's a way to fix it (No it doesn't need an update I checked)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"newest version capcut is less reliable, I'll give 0star for the latest version, there are a lot bugs. first, the audio isn't match ithe exact position, I need to re-open the app. second, I can't event tap the styles & fonts I want to choose the app is frozen and won't load. and last the features won't load it says the connection is error but my internet connection is worked very well, so frustating !"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great overall, editing is great and simple, but this new update makes it so I can't access it anymore and even though I've already updated the app, it still tells me the app isn't secure and it's really frustrating.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a remarkable free app that I believe stands out as one of the top options available. It offers a user-friendly interface while also providing advanced and sophisticated editing features. is a versatile and user-friendly video editing app that offers a wide range of features for both beginners and advanced users. Its intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate, while its advanced editing tools allow for professional-level edits. The app provides a variety of effects, filters, etc."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mean its basically just filmora but a bit simpler and its free, the premium is not bad the ads are only every 25 minutes so its not very disrupteve, the amount of free template makes it amazing, the free ai model is also pretty cool, i haven't come across a problem i have been using for maybe 2 months so im guessing it wont have problems any time soon ‚ò∫."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been used this app for 3 years, and loved it. But recently (after pro has been introduced) it's been a real downhill. Much more glitchy than before, the main track DOESN'T WORK, so many really basic effects have been made pro only, there's no way to filter out pro options and it's become impossible to use. Stolen content runs rife with templates, and the constant push for me to get pro is sickening. I'm on android, but many others have had similar issues on apple devices"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has bugs such as freeze actually freezing when playing and hit to the end of the freeze effect. Moving images/audios and having them to look like they're stuck in the same position before moving. Once tapping on it, it will gain the current movement and once unselecting it will go back at the same previous position before moving like said."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am done editing trying to export for hours and it keeps showing me ""join capcut pro"" even after disabling all the pro features I initially used and cross checked several times. Updating ur app is meant to make it more fun not make it annoying now I have to restart the whole work again and if dis should occur again I might have to get rid of dis app. Once my favorite hope it remains so"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really easy editing app to use. But I agree with a lot of the reviews, about the lagging when over 100mb or even the fact that we can't use some of the features bc of the premium, but not everyone can afford premium version, and you should have kept the old version of capcut that way everyone can use those features."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For what it is it's an extremely good editing app. But half the app is locked behind a pay wall, and will lag out heavily here and there. Also, it doesn't have great song choice's. But thats made up for by being able to add different music in the app your posting something on."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App used to be absolutely amazing, the ideal mobile editing app. But in recent months, the app has been slowing down for me. Continuously crashing, videos crashing while trying to add clips or overlays, and internet connection errors. Ive tried to restart the app, phone, clear data, and cache (delete all my old videos) and delete and reinstall.. nothing has fixed this issue, and i am certainly incredibly bummed. Edit: Refuses to open even after doing everything necessary. Very disappointed."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love this app and I have been able to make hundreds of amazing videos with the app but recently I had to reinstall it on my phone and can't even sign in because a pop up keeps saying I need to update the app with an official playstore to continue. I have updated it with Google playstore the one it leads me to with no update available. I can't make videos or do anything. please please fix this glitch!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is simply the bottom of the barrel. The competition far exceeds it in terms of quality and quantity of services and features. It crashes very often, sometimes the sound just disappears and, worst of all, the text templates also crash. Capcut does not support content creators."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If I reviewed this a few months ago, I would've given it five stars. However the lag- which used to be manageable had reached a point where it's almost impossible to edit videos- short or long. There is also the matter of everything that used to be free had now been turned into pro. Several of my videos won't export because Capcut thinks that I have pro features on it- but since I'm not willing to pay for pro I always avoid them. I've been put really behind by this. Any idea why this happens???"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The editor is so good but has it's flaws. If you decide to edit a 10 minute video with for example your screen recording + avatar + camera at the same time being in the video, it will die. It has done weird flickering for me everytime I do a 20 minute-ish video. It's super frustrating and I wish I didn't have to consider saving up for a PC."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's one of the easiest and best apps to edit with, I use all my videos with Capcut abd they turn out perfect.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many bugs that it's completely unusable. Sometimes I can select multiple pics to upload, sometimes only 1 at a time. Edit pics only for it to blink & undo all of it. Moving a clip undoes all of the editing on other clips. I've been trying for 2hrs to add 25 pics, everytime I select them & click next, it takes me to my project where none of them show up & then crashes. No undo button, audio button disappears at random, projects aren't linked to your acc so reinstall deletes all projects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'd give it more starts but I can't. There's a glitch in capcut that annoys me so much. For example, I'm trying to put velocity to my video and it freezes. I tried to fix the problem but it doesn't work. I got this problem pretty recently, I don't know for how long has it been because I haven't use it in a while, but that doesn't matter. So this thing, with the frozen screen, pisses me off. Please try to fix it, the app has potential but the glitches ruins it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app use to be good, but i don't know if it's just me but the app keeps lagging. Like when i try to drag a sound or speech bubble where i want it, it glitches out completely if that makes sense. Besides that basically everything else about the app is glitchy. And it's really annoying to spend hours editing just for the app to glitch and rearrange everything messing it up."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app. Could use some tweaking when it comes to the search function but I am very happy with it overall. I would like to see more music with lyrics available for posting in more than just TikTok. I use YouTube more and find it aggravating that there are not enough choices available in the sounds library for that use.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CapCut among other Android video editing apps was my best and I would still consider it the best if some bugs I encountered while utilizing it could be fixed. I can no longer use the ‚ÄúAuto Caption‚Äù feature which is one of the features I enjoy so much on the app. Each time I try, a pop up message keeps on telling me ‚ÄúFailure to generate auto text. Try again later‚Äù Gush!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Works sometimes. I'll be making an edit and put the clips on beat then I'll add something like the text and it will slow down the clips and put everything off beat and it will glitch and won't let me change the length of the clip. Glitches so much and it's honestly horrible. There's only been like 2 times where it's actually worked.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ok so I love capcut. It is a life saver but when I click on the create button to make a video it works fine until maybe like 10 to 15 minutes later where it crashes. the whole app entirely. It's still happening it's actually gotten worse the amount of times when I'm making ONE video and it crashes out is absolutely crazy PLEASE FIX
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually a great video editing app but I do have one major issue. I spent the past 3 hours working hard on a video when I looked in the top corner and saw that my project contained a pro feature, I thought ""Ok, I must have at some point accidentally clicked on a pro feature, I'll go fix it"" to only then find that there is no way to locate said feature. Please could you add a way to locate these things, my project is now in unexportable without either removing that feature I can't find or paying."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This editer is good i love it. The only problem is that it is a free app but you have to pay for almost every nice feature, I made alot of videos using this. My editing experience has never been better. If you dont post on social media or dont wanna make videos, there are templates, templates are good for two things. One, making fast easy videos, and two, it is good for entertainment if you are bored. It also has pro features for free sometimes. I highly recommend getting this editing software"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The FREE version of CapCut is awesome, it does so much, it's intuitive and easy to learn and it's packed full of features. It's my go-to app for all video related content. And the cool part is they don't force you to use their watermark it's an option. If you haven't used or experienced CapCut I Hailey recommend giving it a try. I'm confident you will enjoy it and it'll become your favorite app as it has become mine."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good! Honestly, good editing app, most features are simple to understand, stuff for beginners blah blah blah yada yada. The reverse feature (for me at least) glitches to the deepest pits of hell and back. It ruins the clips and screws everything up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very Important Note! Here I wanna say that what is the reason to update application over and over again (Thousand times) in a month, whereas the application run smoothly even without updating app. Unnecessarily, increase the storage with no reason, and when read the description, nothing finds except stating from you and your company, ""removing the bugs and keeping stability."" Why you don't remove bugs and make this app stable one time. I update a day yesterday, and again the nonsense appears."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app overall, but there's ads after ads. Then I have to open the app multiple times just for it to actually work. And the dashboard is at the very bottom of my screen so I can't tap anything. Just horrible. When you had templates, the was ads, that was ok. But even what I was doing the was a Pop up text."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome! This app is the best editing app I have downloaded with all the different details and features, I love it! The templates are easy to create and they supply you with cool templates made by other creators. This app is easy, fun and swift, it doesn't take you long to get into editing and overall this app is great, I would really recommend!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is so nice and it is easy to use but compressing and exporting videos takes too long time and even having internet connected sometimes it do not allow to use online features like effect ,retorch etc. It shows no connection even my decice is connected to the internet. This are the only reasons that disappointed me. Hope you guys will consider these problems and work on it to make the app better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its starting to get worse. Bugs, the app having a stroke when you try to drag and cut a video, random skipping to the farthest parts for the project because of an invisible button so you waste time having to find your way back. No problem with ads, personally. Its the bugs"

When I have entered auto caption/text, I can't edit the video again, when I try to click on all the features such as basic, adjust, or filter and I try to slide the system automatically returns it to normal mode (which is available text menu, effects, overlay, aspect ratio and so on). Please fix this bug, because when I tried it on a raw video (not edited at all) features such as basic, adjust, or filter all worked smoothly"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using CapCut for a while now, and it does the job! There's no paywall for removing a watermark, apps that do that can be annoying. It has tons of customizability, and there's no unnecessary premium features, etc. I gave it a four out of five because it isn't perfect, but it is definitely good."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ive had this app since 2022, but ever since late 2023, the reverse option has been bugging the videos such as freezing frames constantly or glitching the video into a black screen. Despite that, it's been an amazing editing app! Although I would please suggest fix the reverse video option please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Editing experience is just perfect! The capcut template feature has also made the experience much better for me :) I highly recommend downloading capcut (even if you aren't much of an editor) because it taught me loads about editing and now I edit for a tiktok and YouTube! None of this would have been possible without capcut
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It used to be the easiest and most user friendly editing app i ever used as a student i dont have much money and i cant afford to use alot on apps... the editing materials are way better now but they are limited i kinda wished theyd add adds instead of making the user pay even if he she just needs it for one school project once in a quarter of the school year... i hope they would be able to add an ads option instead of money required items
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing, I'm super impressed by what you can create and see on this. Loads of templates, videos and content. I like how you can create your own videos, and have your own channel. The only thing is when I was making a video with a picture, and I tried to crop it, it did not let me crop. It said 'crop' and gave options but it just wouldn't let me do it. That sometimes happens. If this would change, it would be great. Thanks x"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really fun to look at all the templates people make but when I was going to use one, it said ""Pay to export"" and I got upset because I thought that template was funny and wanted to export it and when I clicked on it, it was a pro template so I just found out that some templates can't be exported without Pro, which I don't like, But Great App!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love using capcut but everytime I try to edit a video, it just Feezzes. Or when I try to pause it but it just freezes and I can't unpause or pause. Then sometimes I hear audio. I'm very disappointed because I love editing but I'm not able to. Please fix the lag!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's so easy to use and it is free. The pay version is also worth the price. Not super high like the other apps that try to be like capcut but fall oh so short. So many features and so many tool with ways of learning new techniques and ways of creating. You can also learn make your own templates and let the world try them out. Just top notch app and service!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't Waste Your Money on PRO!! I've been using it a little over a month now. When it works, it's great. But the numerous times that it crashes or gives you a ""no internet connection"" error when you try to use the paid-for features, you'll wonder what you paid for. My phone browser works fine which means the no internet error is bs. I requested a refund and support told me to ask Google. Then Google said to ask the developer since it's been more than 48 hrs. I really feel robbed of $54.99."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is alright, works smoothly. But the problem is...for an unknown cause. When I try to input a text, it doesn't seem to appear and I tried to figure out the cause, there was no problem. I tried swiping my screen because it was probably hidden in the corners, it didn't appear as well. Please fix this bug, it stopped me from continuing to edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Perfect for editing tiktoks, YouTube videos and twitch clips (OLD REVIEW) 2024 now and this app is HORRIBLE. CONSTANT stuttering and turns off randomly. I know you do it on purpose because you had a notification telling me if I wanted to stop suttering then switch to desktop version. Just make your stuff work and there woukdnt be a problem. I refuse to pay for trash."

I sucked at editing at first but, i learned how to do things more easily from capcut, there are some flaws though, including random glitches. Im trying to make something but the sounds are weird and bumpy for some reason and I spent hours on something just for capcut to delete everything. Overall its usually amazing"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Capcut is a really good app for editing and i have used it alot of times before. But recently when i tried to add a video it took forever to compress. And don't even get me started on the exporting. It's also a bit laggy. I don't know if it's a bug or not.(my network connection is totally fine.)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is an okay editing app, I like the effects but there are too many 'Pro' options and not many free ones, I understand you need to make your money somewhere but if I'm honest I miss where everything was free and nice and now I can not use my favourite effects because I am not allowed to buy online, I would also like there to be an option where it asks you if you want to post a remake of a template because otherwise we need to delete it manually and it's just annoying when it posts automatic."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great, amazing, good and stuff... But after the update of April 19? Not sure when you guys will bring the new update to phones or even if you because now I can't even use it! As soon as I open the app up, it tells me download the new update but doesn't even take to the PlayStore! And when I clicked update on PlayStore, nothing happens... It's just annoying as hell and I have to use another app to edit a video! don't know if I'm being dramatic but if I'm right, please fix this-"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know whether this is a problem with my device, but CapCut is refusing to work at all now. It says that the version I have installed is out of date, however when I go to download the latest one, there aren't any updates. I've reinstalled it many times, and the same issue pops up. Please fix this issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: I've had to drop my rating because the reverse tool is now creating a glitchy result every time, even after I updated the app. This has been an invaluable tool for my content creation. There are some glitches with auto caption timing but nothing too major."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the editing on the app but my only problem is that when I download it I open it and it gives me a pop up on the screen that says ""this version of the app is unsafe and I need to download it on the app store"" or sm like that. It's really frustrating because I can't make any more edits and it just stays on that screen. So when I try to update it it won't even update on my phone and just takes me to Google Play app store to install it on more devices."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It usually works well but lately it has had glitches when editing so I have to start from scratch. all of the features I used to use regularly have become ""pro"" so I would have to pay if I want to use them. the latest update aparently only lets me use the templates if i have tiktok which I don't. I uninstalled it then installed it again the glitches somehow got worse and the videos I had ""saved"" disappeared so it looks like I will have to make them again. I'll started looking alternative apps"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was OK to start with but it keeps logging me out of my account and when I try to log back in it just gives error messages. When I try to log back in with my Tiktok account it says only for 13 and older or to try again after 24 hours. Very frustrating. And the latest is that in the middle of editing a pop up shows that the current version isn't secure and you need to download the latest version. But when you go to download the latest version it says you are on the latest version

I uninstalled and installed again and I'm not even able to open the app anymore! at first I thought I was unable to update the app because of my phone storage, but even after clearin up storage I'm unable to fix this issue! please help"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an incredible app! I use this all the time for all sorts of shenanigans, and it does not fail to impress me. If I were to change something, though, it would be a feature where the video clips can snap onto overlays. Makes it easier to perfectly time green screen overlays with video clips."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this for few years. Probably two years. But there's so many glitches here. It's a great editing app but here's some glitches that I've experienced. When I'm typing something, the text delays or just skips a letter. When I mask an overlaid video or a picture, and then keyframe the mask, the mask just MOVES BY ITSELF. Like I tried to fix it but it's still there. And also, I AIN'T PAYING FOR PRO. Nearly everything free becomes PRO. THIS IS JUST ABSURD!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a really good app! would definitely recommend you try it if you want to do editing! though there are some bugs with the editing. whenever i use 2 or more overlays, the whole video becomes low quality. overall, best editing app for android!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app too much, even my videos on YouTube get many views due to the editing but there are some really serious issues with this app, for example whenever I try to type a text the keyboard doesn't appears sometimes the video doesn't exports, sometimes this app shuts automatically, I don't know what's the problems but I think so that the creators should focus on these problems. I request üòá"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Your app is too laggy for my tastemy phone can run in almost a high speed and i still have a lot of space!but when im editing only a 108 mb video it lags so badly , and there is always bugs! So many bugs.. like i cant even explain my dissatisfaction right now, One more thing that you need to fix is that when you drag something it disappears into thin air! If this feature sucks then what else am i going to expect with the other ones?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would give 5 stars, but it has a lot of problems. For example, it won't let me update it. there are not many good effects,laggy,slow,not enough shake presets and effects, etc. Capcut, please fix these problems, or I'm switching to AE."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. However, there's only one issue. and if the update fixes it I'll rate this 5/5, Ok! my issue is when I just trying to export a song it just keeps backing it goes to the home page and when I try to repeat the situation it is just keep forcing to go to the home page, Please Fix (Thank You!)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is going to be 2 stars until they fix this big where it says the version I am using is not ""secure"" while it is from the Google Play Store and been updated properly, it randomly shows up then I can't use the app until I delete it, re install it, open it, close it and open it again so if you could fix it I would appreciate it thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very nice app I am using this app since last two years very easy editing enchanting effects But Their are some problems It lags when effects are applied but anyways after downloading video this bug removed but the video quality can't be determined during editing in capcut That's why I am giving 4 starts . I hope bugs will be removed as fast as .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I been using capcut for years now, but seriously this year, every one of my favorites effects are pro, it causes my edit to turn out very bad and I had to search for more tutorials on the internet for more transition and ideas AND it's actually so bad, when I search a effect IT LAGS MY WHOLE SCREEN which restarted one of my download resources AND IT TOOK a bunch of minutes to download it, BUT IT LAGS too much, for the third I COULDN'T press any animations I search it makes me annoyed. Worse app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The only things that messed everything up is the Pro features. When I wanted to edit something, it's always have the pro features and needed to pay for those edits. I hope everything is free and maybe this will get a 5 star. The only problem is only that, I hope you guys can make it better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good but not good. I needed to delete it then reinstall it because when i tried editing again it said that ""i am using pro features"" when i was using the free features which is pretty annoying. And it happend again without the effects so i hope that it would be fixed so i can use it again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I rated this cause it has some good editing, but the draw back is bugs and clips that I put won't work even if drag back to cut some clips it freezes in place. Overall the update surely didnt fix some issues, but add in features insteed. I hope that Capcut may fixes this issues in the app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is super amazing but I'm giving 3 stars because I downloaded capcut after 2 weeks of uninstalled. Had to cleanup phone.

WHY!?"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great! Love the app, but maybe you could set up a timer on your own when you go onto teleprompter, so when ur recording a transition you don't need someone else to record for you and don't need to touch it, saves the awkwardness! ü§£"

I love it the. only bad thing is that there is something called template's and I'm trying to use it but it's not letting me and when I went to the help center it said I need tiktok.

I'm trying to use a template in tiktok and I just downloaded it recently, then when I opened the app and then logged in with my tiktok acc, I can't find the template selection even tho the app is in the very recent update."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CAPCUT just canceled my professional account which I paid for a year for no reason. I mean, I lost my money, my account, my projects and all because CapCut says I'm underage (I'm 40). Contacting them is impossible, they don't respond. Very bad experience, I DONT RECOMEND THIS APP. I write this to see if I get their attention and at least they give me the money back."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Super good editing app, but I would recommend removing the pro feature and lag. The pro feature is just irritating as u can't use it for good editing/making templates and lag is just some nonsense, try to remove that"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I changed it from 5 stars to 1. Why do you have to pay now when you want to export at high resolution, even though before you didn't? For other features you may have to pay, but what does exporting at 1080p resolution like what? Looks like it's time to switch to the Capcut MOD version haha"

You can become a template creator with ease you just need to be used to Capcut. I've changed my mind a bit. It's now only 4 stars from me because I lost my account.

That's why i just download capcut in playmods. AND ALSO, I CANT OPEN THE WHOLE APP AND IT ALWAYS SAID ""the version of the current app is not secure"" THE HELL IS UR PROBLEM???????!

Please make it so that you can change what app you create on.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It only lets you use an effect a few times before you have to sign up for a very expensive membership subscription and it doesn't matter if you share it to earn a supposed free credit you don't get the free credit even though you shared it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why why why do you keep breaking important features in the app. This time it's the teleprompter, where the edit button doesn't allow you to edit the text box.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good and high quality app for cap cut editing. But this app has a problem that the app doesn't have enough languages. But a large part of the users of this app speak Bengali. But there is no Bengali language option in cap cut. That's why we have to face a lot of problems. First we have to write Bangla to encode the Bengali language then we have to go to capcut and download a font‡•§ Then we write the encoded sentence. I am drawing the attention of the cap cut in this regard.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is completely trash now. Too much ads, effect, useless feature like their social media or else. And this will getting worse after i used auto-caption, the main problem is not the faulty text, but my device getting slower to edit. For your QA, try using auto-caption and then edit one by one. You will see some fps bugs after that. Im using Samsung A53 fw 13. It's pretty slow to used as an editor, sorry to put 1 star from 5. CC was best in 2021-2022, then be junk until now."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's ok when it works. There's some glitch now that says I'm using a pro feature when I'm not so I can't render my video for free like normal. It's happens when I do the auto captions, it says I'm using some filler words filter when it's actually turned off. It doesn't matter which free auto caption I use. My job trying to force ppl to pay for pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So this app has alot of freaking glitches that always pisses me off, just like the text, when i type something and i want to replace a phrase, the new phrase that i changed loses 1 of its letters, like when i change ""just"" it'll became ""jst"" its totally pissing me off like capcut was better than this before... there's no app better than capcut however i wanna change my editing app... Also i have issues with the text-to-speech feature, it glitches like crazy! From 3 stars before, going down to 1"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the best free editing app in my opinion!! but I wish there were some features and updates like: getting a notification when your vid is exported, having more effects and animations etc etc."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can do some really cool videos with this, but the share before use thing is preventing me from giving 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è. It gets aggravating because sometimes it doesn't work all the time. But overall it is very fun to use!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app ever. I don't know why after i downloaded it in my samsung A54, i never couldn't use some features such as text to image, image enhancement, and the search button to find templates that i want. It keeps on said couldn't load, please try again later. ALSO I CAN'T SUBMIT ANY FEEDBACK FOR REPORT THROUGH THE CAPCUT SETTING. I've already uninstall & and reinstalled the app, using speedy network connection, update the app, clear my phone storage but no solution being resolved! Please fix!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using CapCut for quite a while, But now it's basically impossible to edit on if you don't pay for pro I don't like complaining about prices, but there's no way I'm paying ten dollars a month and that's the cheaper price It's ridiculous if you ask me I still use it because it's very nice to crop clips Or add sound effects to certain clips But it's still so slow and glitchy when you're even doing that"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using capcut for a while now and i can say that capcut is really good for beginners! As a beginner, i feel that capcut is really goodüëç, but when you move on to the next stage, i feel that capcut is really laggy and when i export sometimes the timing is not right and different from what i made.. so that is why i give it a 4. But overall, capcut is fantastic!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its a great app. Makes things simple and perfect for editing. But alot of users would like if there was dark mode on CapCut. I edit mostly at night and its not ideal to get flashbanged with such a bright screen.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You can do everything you don't need pro because you can screen record and save the record export onto capcut and film any tiktoks you want you can do edits you can scroll through it like tik tok and so much more I definitely recommend its super fun and creative I'm so glad I have it!!!!!!! BUT the only problem is 2hen you make an edit you cant crop your picture how you want it because of the frame size sk sometimes i screenshot it and it woeks so tey that and thank you for this app. #amazinggg
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love CapCut but y'all really need to fix the glitches with the velocity effects I can't finish my edit because it just freezes up every I try using it. I can't even uninstall and reinstall the app because it will delete all my edits. upset: I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app and the problem is still the same, I can't use a single velocity effects without it freezing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app is literally stressing me out, i keep reinstalling it bcs it's always saying ‚ÄòSecurity Notice‚Äô saying that the version of the app is not stable and not safe when it's literally the latest version like capcut is getting worse and worser day by day, please fix this issue it's literally annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good editing app, it's very simple and easy to understand. However I ask if a feature can be added where you can turn off vibration because it is very annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I didn't even upgrade to pro, I use this app daily as I have become an small Influencer with 200k+ followers. Simple to use for video editing. I'd like to think myself a damn good editor being able to produce loops with good transitions. Don't believe me? Inspector Tap Daddy on TikTok and YouTube. I use it for my short (under 1 min), medium (1-10 min), and long (1 hour long) formats. Solid program."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a pretty cool app. I like it. But the only issue is that I can't upload clips from YouTube or any of my own animations because everytime I do it keeps saying file not supported. I even went to YouTube for tutorials but there was no answer to my problem. Please make this possible.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I recently just discover about CapCut, and I really love and appreciate the things about you can do in Capcut, whatever you want. But, now that the new update came. Everything is laggy like even when I only put some like one effect and will all be laggy and everything is not free anymore like all of the things need to be brought by Pro. (Which, I understand) the only thing is bothering is that it's really laggy and sometimes it freezes my phone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Probably more capable than it advertises, but having joined 2 videos on my phone, then exported them; I have found no way of finding the finished file, nor been able to copy it to my PC. All I am able to do is 'upload', which I have zero interest in doing via my phone. Suffice it to say, I don't need this, you don't need this, nobody needs this. Simply stay away from amateur programs such as this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app I use it all the time for making edits to transitions and videos . Wonderful app overall. I recommend it if you like making kids or just something to do in long car rides! I like using templates for my videos I definitely love this app I recommend downloading and easy to use . The cons abt it is I don't really like the fact of rlly liking a template or feature and it says I have to pay or get the subscription to use it :(
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Slow Upload. I don't know if it's me or capcut. When I had a Google Pixel 4a 5g phone, my videos would upload to capcut so fast. But now that I have an s24, my videos take FOREVER to upload for editing. I'm not sure if the quality of the videos from an s24 is too much for capcut to handle or if it's some other reason. I already hate video editing, and waiting forever for them to upload just to edit is horrible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I edited a 10 min long video on here, and now it won't let me export it. Whenever I try to, at around 50%, it sends me to templates, I have updated this phone and the app, but it still doesn't work. I need this video, and I just can't have around 2 hours of work because this app just wants to send me too templates. I can't even screen record it because whenever I watch my video,it only takes 3 mins to send me to templates, I don't recommend this app. Use a different one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not bad but terribly not good. First, it runs terribly when I use animation effects or just effects. Second, the ""pop up"" animation was removed, but why?? Third, the app's super glitchy. Seriously, I've been using this app for 2 years now and it just keeps getting worse. Everytime I try to custom remove an image, it shrinks down the image to it's original ratio, causing it to look terrible. Worst part is, this app barely supports any files. Please fix these and make your app good again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I've had it for a few years. It's a great app to use if it's your first time editing or your not so serious about editing. The only thing that annoys me is when ads randomly pop up half way through editing. The people that have said it makes their phone crash etc I think just haven't updated their phone in a while and/or don't have enough storage. I would recommend it for most"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i installed capcut here on playstore but the ""this version isn't safe, install from play store instead"" still pops up whenever i open the app. And I've tried everything, from reinstalling to restarting my device, but it'd still pop up... IRRITATING!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to use this all the time but now its just constantly freezing when trying to playback a one minute long video with no overlays. I don't know if it's the new update or what but it wasn't like this before. Restarting the app and phone or reinstalling do not help. Really frustrating
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"üëéüëéü§¨what a dumb app, got me tricked into paying for some filters. Doesn't work, sound doesn't layer, all songs in the collection are lame af, nothing saves, I am an experienced creator but I fried my brain trying to figure out how to work it. Templates don't apply or save, very scarce resources and 0 customer support. Bunch of incompetent crooks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this is one of the best editing apps I have ever downloaded, but what really drives me crazy, is when exporting an edit to my camera roll, the music or sound will be delayed. If you screen record your edit, everything will be silent before ten seconds has passed. Which really puts limits to what I can make"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The editing app is pretty decent, but whenever I try to use the voice changer effect, it always takes a long while for it to load, or it just tells me, ""No internet, please try again."" When I do have internet, but overall, it isn't a bad app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good for editing videos. Like the transitions, animations, and the creative feautures that would be very helpful for all the editors. However, it's so laggy. Like any transitions you add, it'll become laggy, you should fix this as the feautures you added would be such a waste. It carries the lag all the way to your edit. I can't even edit properly because it's so laggy when i literally just added one transition. Fix this lag pls."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing for my utube channel (brunette weirdo) for making fun videos and skits and also just to edit a random video and send it to my friends' group chat! RECOMMEND!! Knocked of a star due to taking so long to load when trying to like how do I say it like upload the video once finished editing. Other than that, 1hundo per cent amazing !!!!!!!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Like everyone says, lags like crazy with long edits. I never make my own projects anymore because of the lags and I only use templates they are for my eyes only so it don't matter but I still like doing that in my free time but even then the templates lag by cutting out the entire edit making it black and only having audio when I scroll too long to find one. I used to make my own edits till everything that I like using is now for members. Fix this and bring old capcut back. I miss the old one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The old capcut background is way better. The white and black background is now a video instead of photo. Now I can't expand the background, cause it has a 6 second limit. Please change it back to photo instead of video."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The bug of the volume lets say your volume is ""99"" and you want it to ""100"" if you try to get it to ""100"" its just skips the number and becomes ""102"" i dont know what is happening but i hate this. How bout you put a box where you put numbers that you want for your volume, instead of this line and ball, how hard you try it just skips number ""100"" please fix this bug"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've really liked CapCut and learned a lot about editing on this app but my only complaint is when sometimes the audios on all my projects will suddenly become extremely fuzzy and low quality and it will go on for literal weeks and it will just stop and this happenes like every month or two and it's so annoying, and it's not even due to storage because I only have like 600 mb storage in total, though it says ""2.4mb"" in settings and nothing is in my cache like people online said to check for, Idk"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updating my review... Please, actually fix these bugs. 1. everytime when I use auto velocity, the video stops or turns into a black screen. 2. everytime when I reverse, it almost crashes my phone, and it literally crashes capcut. 3 everytime when I undo auto velocity, it goes STRAIGHT to the beginning of the video. im gonna be using other apps. You guys STILL didn't fix those mistakes. Please do"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like this app a lot, but their is only one thing holding me back from purchasing premium. It's SO glitchy and slow. It's hard to match up my audio with my video because of the glitch and lag on the effects. If you fix that, then I will move to 5 stars and I will buy the upgrade!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Using the pro version. You gotta fix some bugs. Slow in a high end device is not acceptable. And you should also ad ""slide Left"" to animations when you select a sticker. It's a must have. If you don't add it, I'm out with the pro version."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was always my fav edit app, not complicated and *free*.. well its still easy to use.. but, you need to be pro for almost every effect and I wont pay 10.99‚Ç¨ per month/99.99‚Ç¨ per year for just an not even that good edit app, it's just not worth it. I'll go and download another edit app, capcut is only pay to win now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm on Android and I have this bug for 2 weeks already, I'm a Editor and I use capcut constantly and during those 2 weeks I couldn't use it because it gave me a warning ""security notice"" I deleted the app multiple times and even checked if there was an update or if it was js my phone and nothing showed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fine, use it alot but lags and audio is usually not synced on final export. Have to adjust everything to be off while editing and hope it exports right. Plus no landscape mode, cant even force it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great and fantastic for simple editing. It creates an easier experience for beginner editors. But, I may have a suggestion. I hope this app allows auto rotate to control it! Yes it's odd but I like working on landscape more. I hope I could be able to reach you with this suggestion. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be actually good if the mobile version would bloody function. It just crashes when you try to put the slightest effort into editing, or when you try to deal with audio"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Way too much pro stuff. They put tons of effort into creating extremely high quality pro effects and then give people that can't afford to spend money on an editing app the rest. They even go as far as to take free things and turn them into a paid subscription. Absolutely ridiculous. Being in the creator program (which I am) alone should give you access to some, if not all of them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good not until I encountered this problem wherein I keep on exporting my video and it says that it's already been saved in my gallery. But I can't find it anywhere üò≠. And the moment I export it again it keeps on requesting to free up space, and left with no choice but delete important apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Fix mobile ITS SO BAD! you get kicked out of the project whenever you try to add an overlay, text bugs out if you type it too fast and it's just overall pretty poor. Good otherwise though. Edit: never had the text bug again, but the overlay is back and worse then ever. for short: FIX YOUR APP SHITLORD"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's okay,I edit on here but a few problems I have is that I download it and when I open it, it just crashes and it takes me a while it fix it, n I want to continue to use this app but it js keeps crash. Also when I save a draft when I go back to it to fix up some of the clips the song isn't even matched up with the edit, but yeah I wanna continue to use the app but idk if I can if it keeps crashing üò≠."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its good for simple editing, ive seen lots of good edits made my several creators but I've ran into a problem where I would be scrolling though my video files but if I scrolled too fast then it would play the file on repeat and it would tell me the file doesnt exist, and it would keep playing the file until I closed the app to make it stop, please fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut was great when I first got it, but they've spent so much time trying to monetize everything that it has gotten annoying. They've put stuff behind a paywall. Made finding free stuff much more difficult to do. And have added more ads. There's a bug with the tracking when you're editing that makes stuff speed up/be out of sync and it adds a lot of time to editing because you have to account for that. It's a good app, but has gotten worse. Not the direction you want apps to go."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I've been using it since around 2020. It offers a load of features without making it too confusing to figure out. You can even pay extra if you want more features and effects. There's templates made by other editors too, which you can use once they've uploaded it! However, it can get quite laggy and I find my edits aren't always on beats due to this. If this problem was resolved I would rate even higher."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for 4 years, but the last year, it's been super laggy to the point I can't even edit properly half the time cause I can't see what I'm doing. Playback freezes & lags, especially with the transition to the point I have to export the video constantly just so I can see if it's lined up with the audio. Another recent issue the last couple months is that the audio won't export at all or it cuts off at the end. Sometimes, I have to export it 3 or 4 times before it works."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For a free editing software it offers almost all you could ask and is capable of creating very intrinsic edits. But and this is a big but, when you start making bigger videos it really starts to show its flaws. Everytime I crop, overlay, add a clip, and more it closes my video and opens templates, even worse it is extremely laggy making it unbearable to work with. Had really loved it in the begging, but now I wouldn't use for anything more than a 30sec short."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dunno about anyone else, but I'm able to make 10 minute long videos with this, it all falls along one simple strategy : 1. Start video, export around halfway. 2. Take the exported video now, continue until done, if it doesn't crash, then no need to export twice, only problem is the fact that it lags quickly after around 10 effects / clips if not put back to back."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for almost 2 years and it was working fine until recently. The mobile version does not run well at all and is hindering my ability to edit videos efficiently. Their only ""fix"" to this problem is suggesting you to get the desktop version. You'd hope they would at least try to optimize the mobile app to run better. Sorry, but Capcut has really fallen off."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would rate it 5 stars but... I searched for Dynamic blur but it doesnt appear for me. I have updated the app, restarted it, cleared cache, but it still doesnt work. It used to appear but now it disappeared. I know its there because my friends sent me some screenshots of it being there. So please just fix this glitch, never make it happen again. PLEASE. I just want to do an edit :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be my favorite editing app, but it's gone downhill ever since the Pro membership. Most basic functions I used often have now become for members only, I can't use most effects or animations without paying for it, which defeats the whole purpose of getting this app in the first place. That isn't even mentioning the terrible lag whenever a video is more than 100MB of data, or that the sound is most often not aligned with the video. Please, bring back old CapCut for everyone's sake."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good editing app. To me,ads aren't much of a worry here. Although,there are a few minor inconveniences. The main one is that the text box or like the bar showing text always dissapears when I type something. I'll either have to refresh the text option or refresh the app completely. It's pretty annoying but doesn't really bother me that much. Please fix this glitch and I'll be more than happy to give this a 5 star."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look, I'm really getting pissed from this app! Okay, some of you have the same concern about the ‚Äú search bar ‚Äù cause' that's also my problem. I've already emailed the creators since the ‚Äú feedback ‚Äù is no use, they replied and I swear, I followed all the instructions they gave me and it's very worthless as nothing has changed, it's still the same! FYI, my Wi-Fi has a strong connection also the ‚Äú smooth slow motion ‚Äù is quite alright but the ‚Äú search bar ‚Äù is absolutely a NO! Kindly, fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Downloaded it just to try the hair color filter. It shows it as an option under effects, but won't even show up under the photo editing section for me to try it. Edit: I tried it again because now there's new filters I wanted to try. I'm able to select them, but none of the 7 I tried actually did anything to the pictures I tried. Uninstall this app. Don't even bother wasting your time. All the comments on those filter's said the same thing too. What a waste of an app. They'll be bankrupt soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Here is my honest opinion about capcut. It's fine for editing software, but It's been downhill for a few reasons. First, some basic features are for premium members, which defeats the purpose of why I got this. Also, the app gets extremely laggy when a video is over 100 MB of data. I really like the template feature, but I still feel empty."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Motion tracking feature disappeared out of the blue. A feature it used to have on previous versions and now it suddenly just disappeared. Been using capcut for 3 years, never had a complaint. However the removal of this feature greatly sucks, lots of things you could dl with it before now it's gone like it never existed. I will rate higher when the feature makes a return again, if it ever does return."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Some bugs e.g lags when you use smoothen effect, or turns text to errors when you try editing text, otherwise a very great editing app, love it!! Edited* It just keeps lagging even worse, jumps to the middle when editing, unnecessarily freezes or skips when trying to play, lags so badly. I thought this world get better with updates but it's just getting worse"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm been using Capcut for about 2 years now and I always had the best experience but for the past week, I couldn't download the app after I accidentally uninstalled it. Today, I got to Install it but the app has way too much glitches. I can't download a video effect either. It's making my phone held. I can't use a filter because of the glitches. I always preferred CapCut over other editing apps so I don't want to change my point of view. I hope the owners check the reason behind it. Thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The add-captions don't work on long videos , there weren't even text on most parts. Edit : what the hell , the add-captions only for premium now (pro) I'm broken , I'm done using this I'm going to change to CANVA"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. It is so very very very very very frustrating. All day just to edit an hour long vod. You snip parts to remove with an overlay and it just deletes the rest of the overlay. Even though it's snipped. This has gotten super stressful. I would give a zero star if I could. After the time I have spent on this, I will be finishing and Uninstalling."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good, but could you please add the SWAHILI language among the CAPTION language as it is the fast growing and popular language within Africa and even starts penetrating outside Africa, as you have lots of users of the app in Africa Also it could be better if you could allow both subtitles and caption and not only captions"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UNISTALLED... I will not be trying PRO again unless all the bugs are fixed. You keep adding great features hence being a little pricey (to which I get) but it still pulls us into buying it because how can you pass up on a good feature?! BUT rarely works well. Instead of making the video/picture quality better, it becomes distorted, unstable, unclear and well ugly.. I will change the rating as soon as it gets better as in TRUE TO ITS WORDS..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why is it I have perfect audio on a video. I upload it into capcut and it makes the audio sound underwater and super low!!! This is beyond infuriating. It absolutely ruins my audio and I can't figure out why. Using a pixel 8 pro..and have check video I made against other apps and works great. But capcut turns the audio into a pile of trash. This needs a fix ASAP!!! especially paying for the monthly premium!! This is totally unacceptable
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like this app a lot, but one thing I can't... huge pet peeve... when I try to resize a clip back to normal size it's almost impossible to click into place. I can spend 10 min trying to fix zoomed in clip back to its original size. Really annoying but overall decent app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have a great experience with this app. The only issue I have is the reverse feature. When I reverse my videos, it would scader my videos, making it messy to watch. If that feature is fixed, everything should be fantastic. 4 out of 5. For now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was great until they added capcut Pro. Almost everything is capcut Pro, and ever since you added it, the app has become laggy, and when I add a sound to my videos, the sound disappears all of a sudden.. When I try to log in to capcut with my tiktok account, it says ""try again"" on 24 hours, WHAT 24 HOURS? Sorry, but I'm not waiting an entire DAY, just to log in! Fast forward to the next day, I try to log in again, and it won't work! Get this! I've tried on lots of devices"

I faced problem to fix a cover for video but it turned vanished. I tried again but it seemed to show no result. So I became very disgusted of this. But in one word, it's good. Please give an eye to fix my problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was one of my best apps for video editing. But the last update is so awful. The all is no more steady, always lagging, everything always scattering while I am editing and the whole experience is so frustrating. I regret updating to the latest version."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved capcut, and I used to love editing with it, but recently, most of the app is now pay to use, even effects that used to be free are now locked behind a pro membership, I just miss when the app used to be free and not most of the effects were locked because that's when it was actually fun to use. I mean, even some of the sounds are pro, at this point, why not make it so we have to buy the app in order to use it?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's decent,but very LAGGY and GLITCHY! the video quality is terrible and the videos are always put offbeat! capcut pro isn't worth it either. it might have better shakes and stuff, but the problem with pro is WORSE! only good thing about this app is that it's easy to work and understand."

The audio played before it was meant to, the luminance text effect was dull even though it wasn't before and it made my video pixelated before I added anything. it was the best app before the update.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i dont understand whats going on, the app is good but whenever i try to see, like open an edit it just says photis or videos are deleted or moven in you device, when every pic or video i put in the video is still in the same place as before.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I loved this app but right now its Terrible. The minute i paid for pro the app Continues to suspend my account and require me to very my age even though I've done this multiple times already. And now even after I resolved everything 2 months later it is doing it again. Trying to say I'm under 14 when I am 36. This is ridiculous.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can make amazing edits within days and after a while, you learn that everything is more simple than one would think. However, when attempting to apply for a capcut creator, my app would lag and I would have to chose only 1-2 videos to show. Love it either way, and I hope to soon join the capcut creator community!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is Amazing when i can get it to work correctly. Recently I'm not sure why but my templates are in a different language my settings are in English like they are supposed to be. But when it switches to the other language all the templates are the exact same every time I open the app. The only time it isn't in this unknown language is when I delete the app and reinstall it. PLEASE HELP I LOVE CAPCUT!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app I use it constantly everyday, but I would like if the motion blur was not blurry and like very noisy. Also the smooth slomotion is not smooth at all it looks like a delay effect. Other than that I really love the app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app fell off.. it was a 5 star app with everything perfect untill i can't even export videos anymore... or even put overlays because it sends me to the homepage. EDIT, now I can't even use the app, it says that my app isn't from the original play store app and prevents me from using it, when I'm sure I got it from there, probably because I'm using it as a dual app. FIX YOUR APP."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cool app but they spam the hell out of you with notifications. I will never understand how these apps are so comfortable spaming people like that. This ALWAYS leads to people going away. Either like me, just remive permission to send notifications altogether OR people just uninstall.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is a great editing app.this was my first video editor and i just love the way it does not make editing hard.you can make shakes so easily.overall it is a great editing app but it gets laggy sometimes because i have an old phone.i also have a channel on youtube called dinochad edits.i have edited with capcut more than one year and i would reccommend to also use alight motion for better quality and shakes.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"""This is such a great editing application. If you could add one more option, it would be very appreciated. Please consider adding the option for transitions, animations, sound effects, etc. to work offline.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some reason. Can't even trim the clips like I normally do, yk? the dragging of the videos and easily making them shorter or longer. To see where I can cut it off? After the update, capcut done messed me up. (I threw my phone at the wall in result. Thank you capcut)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app for editing as you get built-in templates with which you can easily edit your videos. Apart from this, you get many features like photo editing and photo upscaling etc. in this app.I recommend this app as a best app for users."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Good app but you guys recently updated the look now when open the menu to add transitions the add button between clips where hide under the menu every time i close the menu select next one apply transition than repeat this process again and again please take little bit up the timeline of a project
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Overall, my experience with CapCut's language and text features has been thoroughly disappointing. Until these issues are addressed and the app receives significant updates in this regard, I cannot recommend it to anyone looking for robust language and text editing capabilities in their video projects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Editing in this app is great but the amount of lag and presence of ads is just annoying. Hopefully one day I'd probably edit on the pc version soon or probably get a better device since the app has been unoptimized for a while so I hope the devs of this app improve the overall optimization of the ui and everything else. And I'd give it 5 stars if they do it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many pro options because back in 2020-2022 I miss when everything was free and I think it needs a pro section because it is getting in the way of the free ones because when I'm in effects or something I always think ""Oh this is a nice effect!"" But it is a pro one so it's just too much for me and if that's so there is a lot of young editers because this is a great starter app. So I don't really recommend this app if my Gworlies are reading this anyways my overall rating is 4/10/ 2/5"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's great for editing at the start and the templates are super useful! Althought there will be some lags and it my be slow as the storage space is quite high
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely loved this app it's easy to edit on and easy to make videos for Tictok!. Anytime I try to save the video I will click export and it will crash the server and kick me out of cap cut I restarted my phone and everything but it keeps crashing. üôÇ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is amazing I love this app it edited smoothly and the extras(free green screens,bg colours,transitions ,texts quality) are Terrific but there is one problem..... It would be a 5 star if there was a button to take you to the end of your project as I make over 30 minute projects and I mostly spend time scrolling through the videos right now I'm making another one and it's 7 minutes long (not done yet) and I plan to make it at least 20 minutes but a 7 minutes is already to long to scroll."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,‚Ä¢pressured to pay ‚Ä¢majority of effects behind pay wall ‚Ä¢exstreme lag no matter the mobile device (completely unable to make edits with transitions with out the app shutting down or freezing) ‚Ä¢unreasonable price for pro effects I've used this app for years this change is hard. the reason most people were drawn to the app was because they could make quality edits with out the stress of pay or huge watermarks. A clean layout separating pro effects and free ones would take a lot of that stress away
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's totally ok for a begginer, BUT OMG IS IT FRUSTRATING: every time i open the app, something gets premium. Literally, there is nothing you can do here because all the things you need are pro. It's not fun anymore. It's basically turning into a pay to use app, and it's so annoying... CAPCUT. GET. BETTER."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for years with no problem, but suddenly there is ALOT of glitches. Firstly whenever you start editing a video it suddenly speeds up the video at the start, causing the edit to be 'not on the beat'. Secondly when I try to reverse a video it crashes the whole entire app. Please fix this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Text randomly starts gliching out. U can barely edut with good effects. Sometimes just ruins your quality The problem is that every good effect is locked behind a paywall All the free ones are okay at best but the pro ones are just some of the best things are seen which is kinda ridiculous since not everyone can pay for pro. Not to mention how some of the best free effects have been moved to pro so you cannot use some of the old free ones. I understand they need to make money that just too much.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is great the only problem I have is that I try to edit my longer videos on here and it takes forever to seek through my vidoe to clip the clips i want would be nice if you could ad like a button or something to skim or seek through your videos in editing so you wouldn't have to swipe so fast and or something just to find the clips you want
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong, I love capcut, it makes editing easy, but I have multiple accounts on my phone and it only signs into one account. It doesn't ask which account I want to sign into. And capcut pro is literally no different. Capcut sometimes likes to lag."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Honestly if you are just using the free verson for home stuff for fun it's okay. However if you are paying user and wanting a solid video editing app a big pass here. The paid has cool features but also is telling me it has new ones that it has always had. Plus keeping a subscription for license to use....No its a big no. Cool toy for kids.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I barely use this App anymore because almost all the AI Filters never work. They will load up to 69% and then Stall. It's just not any fun. I Sent the issue to their customer service, and sent screen cap video trying several of them and all of them failing to finish. And I never got a response beyond sending those videos. I have a SG S23U so it's not like I'm using some cheap budget phone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I do like everything that I can do on the app . It's easy to use even for somebody who isn't good at technology, like me . I think if it was free esspecially the pro and more music options would get a greater out reach to the public ."

I'now u guys want to make money, but ALMOST ALL THE EFFECTS AND OPTIONS THAT WERE USED TO BE FREE ARE NOW PAID.. WHAT A PAIN.. yeah.. I think it's about 87%? and I've been using this app for about 2 years, and before it became CapCut pro, it worked fine..but now it's become really bad, are you serious?? pro options everywhere, too many bugs, so laggy, and the worst.. ads every 1 minute??üò≠üò≠ but it still the BEST app editor..

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT COMPRESSING VIDEO FEATURE? It takes forever to compress a single video, and it's like exporting 2 videos but saving 1 video only. It's very time-consuming and waste of storage."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's great and I love the simplicity of this app but there is a huge problem sometimes it doesn't let me edit like the font and effects keep loading forever I had this problem before too I uninstall and reinstalled it but that just made it even worse it had only fixed after weeks so I couldn't edit until then but now it's back I'm just hoping it takes a little early to be fixed.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I use templates with transitions or slowmo it keeps lagging, the lyrics and sound are delaying. The lyrics are delayed to the sound. Fix it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Changing my review.I'm using this app for 3 years and I think it went worse.Yes, it added more advanced effects, animations and other feature.But I don't find them worth it.TOO MANY laggings which I haven't faced when I first started.Pro features seemed pushed.Sometimes the app gets closed all of sudden and the editing gets damaged.The sound and the video does not play at the same time making tough to edit.It was best app for me.It needed less storage too.Now Capcut feels like a waste of storage"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason, everytime I try to extract audio from a video, it just takes me out of the app, even if I try to overlay or add another video, it just exits the app, I don't know if it has something to do with these ""updated"" features, or if the app can no longer support a device like mine anymore (Android 9)"

In one minute just 3 or 4 percent compressing loading is going forward.. For 100 percent compressing it take 1 hour or more than one hour time . This thing is irritating. I hopeful you fix these issues as soon as possible.. That's why I give you 4 rating."

Other than those bugs I don't think this app is that bad:)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, and I know how to post templates. BUT it never lets me add my own audios and the whole thing with edits is the audio.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is so laggy and bad it's embarrassing. 90% of editors switch to alight motion because of the lag and because of how much effects and animations have switched to only being accessible if you buy capcut plus/pro. It's sad how bad quality clips. Even trying to make good edits is impossible because of how trashy the animations are for non pro users. There's no point in using the app because of how much it lags and how much it is. Please fix the lag and the price!!! ü§¨ Yes I updated it ‚ò†Ô∏è

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app I do but here's my problem. It's pissing me off so I'm set at paying $7 and something a month and now capcut keeps saying that I have to renew and I have to pay $10 a month to use the pro service. You know I'm paying $7 a month. Why should I have to change the price that I pay for something that I already have a subscription to? That's really not fair.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Capcut is a great app for editing don't get me wrong but ever since the new update I try to edit the app kicks me out for some reason then it resets my editing and everything else and my phone always overheats when I use Capcut but the rest of my apps don't make my phone overheat they need to fix all the bugs ASAP and now capcut isn't the capcut back then so I stopped using it and will come back to it when they fix all the bugs.

Every thing I used to make my videos look good have turned into capcut pro and I'm not happy with that so I'll give this rating a 3. 1 point taken off for the fact that everything is capcut pro and another for the fact that it kind of works slow.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"when I first Downloaded this I rated it a 5/5 because of how useful it is for editing, but time passes by and I've been getting laggy issues and bugs, for now they haven't fix it, but Now Pro is a problem, I loved an animation, but it turned to Pro, and now capcut is pretty much getting useless for the past year, I want pro to be removed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it keeps telling me to download the latest version even though i just downloaded it. i dont know why this is happening. i hope you guys fix this problem. it's getting kinda frustrating. but overall, the app itself is nice so im giving it 4 stars for now. looking forward to having this problem fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is entirely displeasing. It has not been very useful lately. In the past, when I was younger. This app was just fine. It had it's bugs, but they were easy enough to ignore. Yet now, it can barely conduct a one minute video. It's pointless. That something as such can't do the job it was made for. Stop trying to milk it. If you get pro it'd be better. It should be at least decent how it is to those not wanting to pay!? I hope to find something better than this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Capcut I been using your app for years. But now the new Text feature is Garbage. It made things harder to edit texts. Bring back the old text feature where when you out a text it automatically go to the place you putted it last time. And also change back your old text customization ITS VERY CONFUSING
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's constantly crashing on me the minute a video becomes 1+ GB. It's so bad I can't even download the progress I have to upload it in a new project, you really need to fix this because it's extremely irritating when I can't even finish any of my projects because of this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far its good but,can you guys add more free features there is so much features that are nice but you have to buy a subscription to use it and the good thing is that I did not get any ads.but really tho I don't want to buy a subscription can you pls make more free features,despite everything the app is really good and fun to use I have a channel and I use this app for editing my videos,it's great.anyway I hope you can change this issue.but I would recommend the app ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, I def recommend it but ever since the update their has been something called ""pro"" that u have to buy to use certain effects or to do certain things on the app, and it's really hard as a capcut creator for me to be able to make edits, pro has taken over almost all the effects and I can't do anything."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have the Windows version on my laptop. I use it for all my social media channels. Since the last update, it crashes when you attempt to export the completed project. So frustrating after spending hours editing, and can't export to upload."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I want to use most of its features, it says that I'm not connected, which I AM CONNECTED! It doesn't even work with VPN. I did reinstall the app, restart my phone, cleared chaches, and updated the app, but none of these ways worked out! I'm so frustrated and don't know what to doüò°"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please send an official notification in the language that the user installed. Initially, it was in Bahasa, but I had choosed English. When I went on holiday to Italy, it immediately switched to Italian notifications. Now that I've returned to Malaysia, it's in Thai language notifications! I don't speak any of these languages!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Newly installed in the process of looking for a bnew video editor. It does not seem to allow me to select videos in my phone's gallery and send them to the app to create a new project (like my previous editor did). Should it allow this (have I got the settings wrong)? Pretty disappointing if it doesn't.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've downloaded this app for years, because it has no logo and I hope you will keep that feature. Over the times, It's becoming bad. I downloaded this app too because of the features but when PRO came it was not it. The quality is also bad even if it's reached 2k/4k and everything."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app for editing, sometimes can be tricky, but theres this one bug, see when i importing my video, and then edited it again it appeared glitched, but when i open it in my gallery its not glitching, I didn't turn off or back my phone while importing the video, gotta switch to alight motion for now"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hii I've been using this app for a few years now and it's my first time experiencing the bug like... I can't save the edit i made and i don't want to uninstall it thus all of my hard work would be gone. I'll give it 5 stars once the bug is fixed again, we really need this editing app. Plss fix itüòîüòîüôèüôè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app really good! But there's one issue with this app, sometimes when I go on it the song is on yk from the template and then when I get off the sound is still playing? Capcut, please fix this issue but overall this app, its very fantasticü§ó"

I cannot edit anything at all it delays my edits and gluched then I worked on an edit for an HOUR saved it and the sound was god and the video was glitches Went back and my whole edit was deleted. I would love to give it a 0, but a sadly cannot"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I bought pro and it's not giving me premium features and instead tells me that I need to join pro in order to use the feature I added. If I click the $10.99 a month for pro then it tells me that I am already subscribed. I even paid for the $99.99 for the whole year and I'm still not getting pro. Something needs to be done or my money needs to be returned to me immediately.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good editing app and all but there's a couple problems, number 1 is that it's really laggy sometimes whenever I add animation to the text sometimes or something else and number 2 is that there's no new effects or anything, overall it's good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use this app a lot, and i love it. But for some reason, when i try to upload my videos, cap cut doesn't let me and kick's me out of the upload screen. I googled some reasones, and it wasn't bc of update, nor bc of my internet ( I tried different internets and fi fi's ) It's not my storage either, so i don't understand the broblem. Can someone help me?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Okay i started using capcut in around 2021 and so far its good but the thing im bothered abt is the video when i made it short and realised a mistake but then i migt have to redo everything because its a lot of footage so please management of capcut change that it keeps sayimg transition is too short okk when i try to click on the vid thanks for reading
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for years, and it's been incredibly helpful. However, I have an issue with the way it compresses videos, especially when they're long. It takes a lot of time, which can be frustrating. I'm really hoping this problem gets fixed soon, and I'm eagerly awaiting the update."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love editing but today when I tried style and using any one of them the video wouldn't play no matter how many times I retried it the templates are cool if you want some ideas and some of the videos are really funny overall the app is really good.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am uploading on YouTube. and the templates, some of them are copyright, and I'm currently working on not losing my channel, but if you're using text or stickers making your own video stuff like that, then it works perfectly fine."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many adds,so laggy,the pro is too expensive and atp isnt even real editing if people use pro cause the effects are so good they arent even really editing. Just using effects. Such a bad app. It doesnt export my videos either. Turning everything into pro isnt helpful. Might as well make the app cost 30$ if youre gonna make everything pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately you can't use one subscription on two phones. I was even willing to pay an extra subscription on my other phone, but when I go to purchase, it says ""error, you are already a pro member"", and yet it won't let me use any of the pro features. Very frustrating"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good creating app! I had my first edit on my Android and i split my vids that the edit gets easier, but their is a glitch or a bug and i can't split my videos anymore. It was 50ft far because i need it for my videos without this glitch"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app, I've been using capcut since it came out, well I started using it a year after it came out. The reason I gave this app a 3 star, is because of 'capcut pro' It's honestly annoying because if you don't have capcut pro, you can't really use anything. And I think the app would be used a lot more without it, or if they made it cheaper, because I'm pretty broke. But capcut please give us more non pro stuff, because I can barely do anything on the app now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing App, but don't sign in. I absolutely love this app. I use it to edit YouTube videos, but when I signed in with my email, suddenly I just got ads on everything. Signed back out and no more ads. Other than that is perfect"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wanna rate this 5, but I can't when I'm using template it's not on the beat and the video took so long and it kicks me out and I was raging like a dinosaur. And capcut please don't forgot to fix this bug. Thank you. That's all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well the update are not that bad but I'm kinda missing the old capcut version... (Like... I'm still okay with this version because they have a lots of good effects and everything.) You should add the effect graf back. It's very useful for editing. And also could I be a ""CAPCUT CREATOR"" please??? I'm really good at editing if you let me... (I'm not lying I swear.) I've been a CAPCUT editor when I was on my old phone but I made a new account/phone numbers so please accept me capcut üòÉüòîüíî"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app this is so cool and easy to make videos. This is the best app you can find for editing , if you have tiktok you can try lots of templates and also you can know how to edit from the capcut ( the tiktok account of capcut ) after watching the video you can start editing and you will suprised how easy it is but the thing is the ai filters only work on pics and not in video's and some tools are not in there that the capcut tiktok account editor's showing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a great editing app! So far the easiest editing app I know. But i find it annoying that after i use a template and export it it gives me an ad. Not to much ads in capcut though, so im not complaining."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"2 star. It used to be good, but the constant change in each update I find it really annoying.. Like the effects I want to use is gone now, and those ""good effects""? all need to spendüí≤. capcut really just sucking money from all those content creators who use it because it's a popular appü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è where I find this app is just not that great to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut is the best app like ever invented! It has templates that you can use and you can use your very on photos! But ever since they have added capcut pro the game keeps on lagging and it is very annoying sometimes. Otherwise then it is a awesome game highly recommended!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wow this app is so cool. It gives me so many templates to choose from. And the best part is that I can ask my friend to send me pictures of them and I can make a edit. I also like how it let's you post on tic tok right away. Over all cap cut is amazing and gets me closer to my friends and family. I hope this feed back help anyone who was looking for a app like this and this is the one. Thank you and I hope this helps. I also think you should get this app right now because it is just so good thx.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but when I try to add my voice for voice over it says it couldnt read the text somehow. When I do the recording for my voice, it shows a chinese version as well but it doesnt play. Im using a samsung S24ultra. Maybe this feature isnt optimized yet"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I can't drag the video bar below the overlay bar of the blank background I added in capcut app. It literally brought me a headache. It's been one hour trying all the methods to drag the video bar down below and remove the original video background and add another overlay background. It is frustrating.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So good, I do all my editing on it. But for some reason it now goes really laggy and would freeze when I watch me edit. I have to export it so I cab watch it without this issue. I don't know how to fix it"

However it says ""No internet connection"" although I check my connection and it's full bars. I will remove this review if I find out it's just a problem with my connection."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is the the best because you can upload your videos to YouTube and I have 138subs now my YouTube channel is beast form874. But I really like this you can post stuff in tiktok,you can share it with people to. It's one of the best apps for making videos and stuff. I really like the app other than that good app you can make your own videos it's really fun it's kinda like YouTube shorts,and tiktok. You can scroll through templates. And other things it's really fun that's all I have to say."

Uninstalled & reinstalled only to lose all my work and STILL have the problem."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it its awesome, though sometimes when I try to upload audio on different devices it doesn't work. For Example, Android, TCL, etc. This needs to be updated, as soon as possible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cant do templates and stuff I can only put text, screenshot and videos it shows ""no internet connection"" even if I have internet Please fix this I've read some other reviews like this so I guess I'm not the only one. It's a bug which leads many people alight motion like me but I didn't cause I have a habit of cap cut.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A lot of great features and constantly getting better and better. Now, if it could export clips (partial projects in/out points) that would be highly enabling. Lipsynch would also be amazing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love using capcut for editing!!! It's perfect for beginners and really easy to use. Don't love that some of the better editing tools are unlocked by paying for Pro, but you can still make really good edits with the free version!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't mind had to watch ads to export my videos but some of your ads are unwatchable, it's skipped straight to close ads/shop, and then I was still unable to export since the ads was not played. Is this a trick to force users to subscribe your pro package? Will uninstall this app soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great over all, but I don't seem to understand why the fade out animation isn't available for stickers. Because I need fade out for logos and since it's not there, the logo ends up transitioning out so roughly!!!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"90% of the features seem like they're pro features. That's really annoying. Besides that, Love this app a lot actually! I adore how the freeze thing works, never change it (or make it pro)!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much. It is great. The only thing I think could use an upgrade is automatically adding the sound from Tic Tok into the template, like it used to be, but CapCut changed it. Other than that, it's an awesome app. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I Capcut use for edits and videos. It used to be better, but now so many things are pro and it's so annoying. There's also a glitch where it says you're using pro features, even when you're not. This means you can't upload your project and it's so annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It does not work properly. It used to work in my old phone but after I downloaded it in my new phone nothing (like animations) loaded and I couldn't even add music which I already had on my phone to the video I was creating.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ima but to write an article on why pro should be removed. One, it's not very good because people who don't have a lot of money can't have pro because they can't pay for it, LIKE ME- BUT ANYWAYS. second, it's hard to use without pro and I can't edit well. Third, when you didn't add pro it was easier to edit without any problems and I could use any effect I want. But now I can't and it's harder to make popular edits. It really upsets me. So please get rid of pro. so please, get rid of pro. Please-"

My Main problem is whenever I want to add text behind any image or PNG I always became unsuccessful... Yes there are other ways to do it but it makes time waste more than needed.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yo, why cacapcut like this? Am an editor. But whenever I am using capcut to edit, it will somehow kick me out of the app, and turn my phone screen, my entire phone screen bro, will turn white. Plain flash light. And it will be very hard for me to continue my edit. And hey, I am not gonna lie, Alight motion is better than capcut. Alight motion has been glitching, though. But not like capcut. Alight motion has never kicked me out while editing. Am very mad y'all, very, very mad."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was a five star app until they recently updated (yesterday) the app so I now have to pay to use my favorite caption that I have been using for years now. It is extremely annoying that they would now make me pay to get the pro version and they should get rid of the new update that makes it worse for people who don't want to pay monthly fees.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Could not update the new features. I have been trying to update this app to have access to the new features umpteenth times.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3 stars for this because the pro effects are too annoying and also Capcut sometimes says I have no internet connection when I'm literally connected to it and when sometimes i export the video, the video I exported was glitched.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's the best editing app, except they are making EVERYTHING pro and charge so much money for it. And I dont even use anything pro, but they still accused me of using pro and capcut always, and I mean ALWAYS glitches!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give it a five but it's a three for one particular reason. I've had this app for a while and I had it on one of my old Android phones. I got a new phone because my old one broke. I had no problem with capcut on my otter phone except for the fact that it was glitchy. I had the default features including templates. I downloaded capcut recently and came to the conclusion that the templates were missing. Nothing seems to work. It would be much appreciated if I could get some feedback.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a great app really and I've used it for about a year or so now but recently every time I try to put in subtitles or just use the text it lags and inputs my text very slowly and I usually end up with lots of spelling mistakes. And I everytime I start to make video I always get sped up at the start when I press play and my videos usually end up off timed. I don't know if you get what I'm saying but please if you can fix it so I can go back to using it I'm bored without it üò≠

It is not the best editing platform, it's the worst, they just spent all their money on fake ads and don't even fix bugs. I wish I could use capcut but an clumsy idiot doesn't ever update the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app and I use it everyday but I can't even use the text animation?,it just doesn't work for me,then when I add my clips it goes laggy for no reason.,then I cant even type in peace it only lags then that!,then when I add effects it lags too?!,capcut pls fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Always lagging, when I using an effect my CAPCUT CRASHED. I reported the bug but it never fixed, bet alight motion more good to use. And some of my favourites effects to put it changed to pro, First of all... Why do we need pro effects?! It wasting other people's parents money and theirs money!! Can you just do an better update???? I might delete my old capcut and downloaded back. Much better idea"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay, this is an edited review, I'm keeping the 5 stars because this is an absolutely AMAZING app, but there is one HORRENDOUS problem with the new update that I NEED to clear up. When you are reversing a clip it takes SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT USED TO! A .5 second clip could be done reversing in less than a minute, but now, a clip the same length takes 5 MINUTES TO GET 10% DONE! THATS ALMOST AN HOUR FOR HALF A SECOND!! As someone who uses this app multiple times a day, that is ABSURD! PLEASE FIX!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. I edit a looot with it but for the past idk 5 weeks maybe a month. it has been coming up with a ""download latest version in app store"" and when I go to it in app store it's perfectly fine. Please fix this !"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Black screen isn't even the problem, whenever i add an overlay it either goes back straight to home or to templates. You need to repeat it multiple times untill it stops. Its really annoying. This wasn't like this before CapCut had an update, and im pretty sure nothings wrong with my device since my friends also has this issue. When you add an overlay you have to keep repeating it over and over, sometimes more than 30x on repeat."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a Good editing app, but here's a big problem whenever I go to new project and select any video it takes compressing and it takes so long time. fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love CapCut its a really good editing app. I've learned so many new things and my editing skills have improved so much! I really recommend it there's a bunch of tutorials that can help
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, If you had pro it would be a five star, But for people without pro, It's a four star, Let me explain, People with That pro has so much more things to do, But, Sometimes It cuts you off and makes you pay again, And for people Without pro, It's also amazing but A lot less possiblys, And they make the pro stuff so much better üò≠üôèüèª It ain't fair- It makes you want to Buy Pro but yet, It was EXPENSIVE- At least for some people, it depends On What Device you're using,"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! The features are amazing, the editing quality is good, and the videos turn out nice! I just wish that the watermark was free to take off, and also sometimes.....it takes an hour to load a 9 minute video. It would have me wait half an hour trying to load or export a video. But out of that, I would say this is the best editing app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: A lot of things are now locked behind a paywall. It used to be a lower cost, but it's higher now. This is an okay editor, but I wouldn't pay 79$ a year for it. I will be trying the pc version or something else because the app is incredibly unstable. When trying to move overlays, they don't follow my finger and end up glitching around. The problem with the duration glitching still occurs. Audio only matches with images sometimes. CapCut was so close to being perfect for anyone to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! I've been using them for few months now & I'm really satisfied with it! Those few ads are nothing compare to those beautiful template! But, I've a problem while using this such as when I wanna save a video from the template, there's black background behind the text. This only happens few times before, so I hope it can be fix. But overall, this app is great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good app! The pro feature is really annoying since most of the good effects are on Pro and not everyone can pay for Pro. Also it would be nice if you could name extracted audios, since I have alot of them and I can never find the ones that I'm looking for. Naming extracted audios and being able to put them in folders would help. Putting all of that aside, it's a great free editing app and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an editing app that's easy and simple to use! :D"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Because of CAPCUT, I've been able to make some very impressive videos and without a SEO. It's an Amazing AI Intuitive APP... IT DOES ALL OF THE WORK AND I JUST USE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES, MUSIC, TEXT TRYING TO PROMOTE MY BRAND"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app, sure, but there are WAY too many bugs... The frames freeze at certain times and sometimes when I go to a video in it, the video doesn't play and I can't do anything in the video editor after going into the templates. Sometimes, when I use a template, the audio doesn't play. Sometimes I have to click on a video twice to enter it where you edit videos. Besides that, there's quite a lot to do but that's my only positive thought about this app.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is perfect for editing, making movies, and more. I have just one problem. The app just freezes the video and pauses it during playback. This just started and I don't know what to do. I tried on my iPad and it plays just fine! I just have CapCut open. If you can, please fix this. Edit 1: This is happening with all my videos. Edit 2: This is no longer happening on any of my devices."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello capcut, the app is very useful to edit and i love it. But, there is one thing, About the PRO Thing, Why are one filter that I used to like so much and use it (Smart sharpen) It's Only for PRO? Excuse me? I'm sorry If this is a misunderstood, But I'm pretty sure smart sharpen was a free effect."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a mobile video editor. Does that pretty well. However, there is often desync between the finished product and the downloaded video. Can be irritating to spend forever working on something that you finally got perfectly synced to the audio only for it... Not to be synced. Lol. But it's the best I've used on mobile and it's good enough for now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is a wonderful ""free"" editing app. But there has been glitches in my experiences of using this app. Like when I'm trying to use the key frames sometimes it doesn't let me move or zoom in and out on it. But I don't think the animation fade in on the text should be pro. If you could change that it would be wonderful since I always use that animation. Thank you for reading this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut pro sucks! Capcut's free version is limited in its features, with some features such as background music, transition effects, and 3D zoom being locked behind a paywall. This can be frustrating for users who want to use the full range of features without having to pay for them. Capcut Pro, the paid version of the app, offers a subscription-based model, which can be expensive for users who only need some of its features occasionally. But overall capcut WAS a great app. (Before the update ü´§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app was amazing. I loved the clean transitions (ECT) but they had this great feature where you could export with pro features for free. All you had to do was watch an ad and you could export. But they got rid of it and now you have to use terrible transitions and very limited resources for improving videos. I don't like it anymore it was a great app but it flopped.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing for editing videos. Love the music and effects. Stickers were useful for blocking out some things, although i have had some problems with the video. The soundtracks and noises i put keep messing up and then i have to redo it. Also, when im about to add something to the video, whether its sound or more videos, it takes me out of the app. Other than that, no other problems. I rate this app 4 stars ‚ú®"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the ease of use of CapCut (it makes editing accessible), but I've given it 3 stars because of some issues with performance. The lagging is bad at times, to the point where I struggle to get through one very small video. The more effects and filters you use, the worse the lag gets. Even emptying the cache and having enough storage space, it doesn't function as it should. Edit: Somehow, it's gotten worse! Now I can barely use the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app, Use it all the time. The only thing that really annoys me can be the lag well editing and the fact that the slow motion isn't as smooth as I'd like. Edit: I haven't used capcut in a while ever since they added premium, decided I'd try and edit a video for the first time in months and it's gotten so much worse. The lag is worse, more things are for capcut pro. I hate it, it used to be the perfect app for editors because it was easy to use and now it's not."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used capcut for a few months now, and everything was fine. I was able to scroll through templates with no problem, and I could add effects easily. But in the past 2 months, I have not been able to scroll through templates, add any sort of effect or filter, and everything is buggy. I tried updating the app, but it ended up logging me out of my account, and I wasn't able to log back in. Nothing was fixed, and now I'm not able to make videos. I really hope this app gets a REAL update soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"By far my fav video editing app for mobile (and the expanded options on desktop(. Once you figure out what everything does, it's super user friendly. Really love the expanse of feature included, and I moved to pro pretty quick. Took a star off because it tends to crash more on mobile, e.g. Randomly closes during editing, not saving a particular effect (doesn't matter what kind but usually to do w/importing a photo or video clip), out of sync audio to the actual clip when in editor mode etc."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It can do a lot of things other video editors can't, but I also feel like it's the other way too. I highly recommend experimenting with multiple video editors to see what has more of the features you'd use"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app for certain things but it has some big problems, like sometimes I'll be editing a video and the whole track turns dark? What's up with that? And whenever that happens I have to restart. It's not nice when that happens. Theres also to constant freezes when I put effects it makes it offbeat and ruins it. But, without all that? It's a great app with amazing and outstanding templates created by talented people and capcut makes it all come to life and it's great on that note<3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I personally love this app. But a problem that has been going on for me is that, once I place speed on for example. 0.3. once I click on better quality it turns into less smooth quality this has been going on for a while and making me upset all the times I've restarted my phone, deleted the app, and searched up my problem..... nothing so I would like if you could fix this problem. Thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Over all its a great app! the features are great, and it's easy to use! the only problem is that recently, I have been having this glitch where after about 20 screenshots on the editing screen goes all black and I can't edit anything. I tried updating it but that didn't help, hopefully this will be fixed because I promised my followers a mini movie."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but there are way too many bugs. Once these issues are fixed I'd be more than happy to up my rating. 1. Keyframes don't work 9/10. 2. The lagging is horrible, especially while working on a long project and losing progress because of it. Something that would also be appreciated is more availability to premium items; Making them free in return for watching (a) video(s) per use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app but at the moment it glitches constantly which is very annoying. I've been using this app for a couple of years to create and edit videos and I love it. Even someone a bit technologically challenged like myself can figure out the basics and get better slowly. Unfortunately in the last month or so it has been giving me constant trouble. Despite the many updates it keep glitching, stopping for no reason, closing when I try to change some bits and making it useless. Please fix it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Since I've been using this app for more than a year, I think it's time for me to give my review on this app.. It's amazing! Not perfect though.. first, I'll start with my positives, for an editing app for phones, this is one of the most well made ones! It has plenty of features at its desposal, even without a premium subscription, you can do so much! However, it's the subscription that ruins it. I wish that the normal editing tools weren't so stiff compared to the premium ones. Balance is key."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using CapCut since the start of the lockdown which is back in 2020. After going through so many useful update features such as graphs, more animation (but some of the latest ones needs to be fix), more amazing effects, and etc. But since the Pro feature appeared, it hasn't really been that 'acceptable' for me. Recently, there are some of my favorite FREE effects just turned into Pro. Those effects seems to be used by many users so I think that's why they changed to Pro sadly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give this app 0 stars I would. It used to be great. It has an intuitive software and offers many professional tools for free. However, this app is beyond glitchy and laggy. When I try to do basic editing functions like adding videos the app crashes. Sometimes the app crashes so bad that my whole system UI temporarily stops working. It is only this app. Do not get this app there are better options. You will waste your time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really good app for a beginner but has a lot of issues - will often glitch out, especially when using text - will sometimes look completely different after exporting - will have playback issues, and various other problems. The app is often slow and I find that whenever I'm making a video with a lot of short clips, it struggles to play them in time. Another small issue I have is that you don't have the option to select multiple clips at the same time, this is a minor issue but is still annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is good for editing. Many new features are introduced which are amazing for editing. The only problem is with the sound option. I want to use the sounds which are installed in my device but the app starts to lag when I open the ""sound"" option and after some minutes, it starts to work normally. Please fix this issue because it's very annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for editng but i have one problem and thats why im giving it 4 stars. Whenever i want to scroll an audio or effect, it doesnt move or slide like it suppose to. Instead, it freezes and when i let go, it goes to a random place in that direction or disappears but still acts like a normal audio or effect. Please fix this in your next update, thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a simple and good editing app, but there are a lot of glitches and errors. Yesterday, I was working on a video that took me over 10 hours (with breaks) then capcut crashed, and when I opened capcut and tried opening the video I was working on, it says ""some footages are corrupted"" for no reason at all, and I couldn't open it. Many other people also experienced this. Capcut please fix it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is my go to for editing no matter what, but I don't have a laptop/desktop, and editing from my phone is horribly laggy and slow ‚Äì particularly when I add 2 or more lines of text or overlays. Don't get me wrong, the app itself is great;not overrun with ads, many different editing options that you don't have to pay for, and project backup. Even still, I would GREATLY appreciate it if you all could reduce lag on phones, specifically Androids, and I'd give you all 5 stars üòÅ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is a great one when it comes to editing especially when you are a content creator. I have been using this for a year or two. Recently whenever I export a video/template, I cannot find the edit I made in my gallery. I have to uninstall and reinstall Capcut repeatedly just to make an edit for my YouTube channel. Kindly fix this issue. Thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally for me, it's a very good app don't get me wrong. I've been using it since 2019. I've used capcut to edit during my time. I would be giving capcut a 5 star, if the motion blur worked. From previous edits I've made with the capcut motion blur feature, it has been great. But now when I use it, it doesn't even look like motion blur, it looks like the effect feature ""unreal 2"". I thought it was glitch, I tried to see if there was an update but none. That is all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good editing app! But, ever since their new "" pro "" feature, almost every effect is locked behind a paywall. I'd say 96% of the effects need to be payed for. Some of my favorite effects before this update are now no longer usable. And for this reason, I might just switch to a new editing app. Plus, there are SO many glitches and bugs that they refuse to fix. Edit: New update! More effects have been locked behind the dreaded paywall. Soon this whole app will have to be paid for."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best free video editing app. Awesome features. For the current version though, scrolling thru the gallery to add videos or pictures can be a chore. No handle is provided and one might have to swipe and scroll thru thousands of files. Somehow a handle is provided when using templates. Please do something about this. That aside, still a 5-star for this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just updated the app, and it logged me out. Tried to login & keep getting a ""try again in 24 hours"" & ""Unable to login if under 13 years of age""?? Capcut stands out from the other free video editor apps for the amount of features and effects it offers. However, editing video on it is a nightmare!! The lag is ridiculous and takes forever. Also if you add text or effects, it will also lag, badly!! So essentially the idea of using it is better than the actual experience! Please fix these issues!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to love capcut a lot but then it suddenly doesn't want to import photos and clips anymore. It just doesn't work anymore. If you're looking for something reliable, probably look at other options before deciding on capcut. If you're looking for something easy and has templates that are usuable then go. Professional editing here is next to impossible now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used it for years now, and everything was fine yesterday, but suddenly today nothing works. I had to delete and reinstall for it to even allow me to view an uploaded video. When I try to edit videos, splitting two videos causes the whole app to suddenly no longer work. I've restarted my phone twice, deleted apps, and even deleted a bunch of edited videos to see if it would help. Still, nothing works."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This has to be the most annoying app ever. There are so many things wrong with it that I don't have space to list them all. I'm so ü§¨mad I bought the pro version because it's terrible too!! The filters don't work properly and they're so measly that it doesn't even pretend to filter by anything other than number of clips and duration, yet it still pulls in templates outside of those parameters. The videos are impossible to edit once you preview. Can't find templates saved after the fact. UGH smdh"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing audio tracks is glitchy. If you attempt to add audio and trim or move them, they move into weird places when unselected. For example, a track moved to the very beginning will appear to the far left outside of the track ""boundary"" when I unselect it/tap in another area. If that makes sense. I wouldn't give the app developers money if their app can't even properly function. Uninstalling because this app is frustrating to use. So many glitches and bugs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, it even allows you to remove the watermark for free. However, there seems to be a glitch where when I try to play the video, it speeds up for a second and then goes back to normal. This glitch is really annoying makes it hard to edit. Another glitch is that it lags when I put in certain effects and filters. Please fix this. And one more thing, so many of the effects cost money. When I find the perfect effect for my video, it ends up costing money..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Actually this is probably the best editing app. There is so many stuff you can do with it, like Greenscreening, and other cool edits. The storage the video takes is not that big. But I have some problems though. First when I export my film and I check it at my gallery, the video seems do be offbeat even though if I adjusted it. Also when I want my text to fade away I checked the animations only to find out that it needs capcut pro. Seriously??? But overall it's nice it just needs improvements."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm a pro member, and I'm starting to become concerned. I've been using Capcut for about 6 months and until recently I've lived it. I can't use most of the pro features unsure why as I paid the annual membership and it's active until August 2024. Not only are most of the pro features not worked but my videos are exporting with an audio delay. The audio is about 3 seconds slower than my video. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I restarted my phone and still not working properly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Uhg... so much great, but the bad is adding up... i paid for pro and now regret it. The sound doesn't line up once you export it. Makes reels impossible. The constant random jumping from one end of the video to another while I'm trying to edit. And the RANDOM LETTERS when you type. And PLEASE make it easier to move sections around.. you never know where it's gonna end up if you have more than 5 or 6 sections. What did you guys do to this app?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm an editor, and use two different apps to do so, CapCut is the one I use for clips to make sure I have better quality, sometimes I'll even use it for a velocity from time to time. Though, recently, they've started making ridiculous things for PRO, for example, 'Fps Lag'. Which is ridiculous and is just a simple, quick way to earn money. Many other effects have been victim to this, too. Not everyone wants to pay for an app that's original motto was ""free and easy"", that's gone out the window."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very great app. Has so many features. I use it for a lot of things. I have a couple problems with it though. For one I use it for my YouTube videos and when I edit a video, it always freezes in the beginning of a clip for 2 seconds and it gets so annoying. I hope this gets fixed because Idk what other apps I could use for my YouTube videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. But my only complaint is that almost everything is pro now. All my favorite effects, transitions, fonts, etc, I can no longer use them because of pro. At this point everything will be pro and that's personally really annoying me. Now whenever there are new effects, transitions or something else, they're almost alway for the pro users. The ones that use the free version barely get anything now, and the things we had are slowly being turned into pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good and easy to use, but honestly all the things you have to pay for are just annoying. I've been using this app to make edits recently, but all the really good options like effects and animations for videos are all locked behind a pay wall. It's really dissappointing to find an effect that really matches what I'm looking for just to see that only 'pro' users can use it. But besides all the things that require you to pay for Pro, it's still good to edit with in my opinion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE app, not only are they making all the useful things pro, but they can't even get basic stuff like text to work. Now whenever I'm writing text, it'll add random letters I didn't type, or, double up letters in my words. Worst part is, you can't erase them, they just appear in the text box on the video, not where you type, so you have to delete and retype all your text to get rid of the extra letters."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok. I will say it would be a good idea to have beat synced effects. I tried to sync a lighting effect to the beats of a song and when I exported it the sync was out. Dedicated beat synced effects would be a brilliant idea, it's a bit buggy sometimes too, latest one is hanging around 97ish% when exporting and copyright check only working when it wants to. Also yeah... All the stuff going pro, big mistake. People will just pay for something else better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Needs an audio waveform like YT create. Capcut definitely has the most features and it is quite useful except for the fact that there's no or of the box audio wave form. Yes we can separate the audio from the video to see it but that's not the same as just having it. The editing process is so much harder without being able to see where to cut the audio
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"More and more features became ""pro only"". Well, that's sad but understandable. However, I'm never buying a license as a subscription model. If there's no one-time or lifetime license it'll mean to move on to another product. No consistency in terminology: ""Crop"" is being used differently. Can't ""stretch"" a video to adjust content to specified aspect ratio."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is very easy to use and has a bunch of free editing tools and is very helpful. It's better than most editing apps for mobile if not probably the best mobile editing app and highly recommend if your looking for a mobile editing app. but there is also a bug that keeps annoying me. (Btw I think it's a bug but I'm not completely sure) so capcut if you're reading this can you fix it please? Some effects will stop you from using emojis. ( Though I'm still not sure if that's a glitch anyways)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible.... super disappointed this app used to be so good now it is awful. I'm not sure what they did to mess it up so bad. There are tons of issues whenever exporting videos the audio gets out of sync for the first part of the video. They also changed the app so now you can't download cloud saves from your computer to your phone and when editing on the phone you are very limited to what you can do. It won't let you add fx to video unless it's on the main video track or add transitions.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mid. After the latest mobile update, the amount of app crashes are through the roof. As a result of all the new features that have been added, has drastically slowed down the app itself which in turn them leads to more app crashes. I'd have preferred to be on the older version. When reducing video speed it'll be half way through processing it and then bomb out. I seriously do not like it at all. Running it on a powerful device as well so nothing on my end."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There's that one specific time where I saved a long video/project to my device for my school project and it didn't show up on my gallery, files, or photos. Well, that caused me to freak out a lot before eventually noticing that it only appears in the video selection menu when I was reediting the project. To put it simply, I didn't get sleep that night and wasted so much mobile data. But this app has its positives and unique stuff to it that I kept using it. So... 4/5?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app, and it's easy to use, but last week they started to make a lot of things (like animations or effects) Pro. This is really annoying, because I'm an editor on YouTube and I can't use some of the things I normally use now, which will ruin my editing style. If they changed everything back to normal (making most animations, effects, and filters free again) I'll give CapCut a 5 stars. Thank you for reading!! <33"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good video editor that has key frames, diverse fx, and free music/sfx. It is much better for me on PC rather than mobile because it looks more open and less congested. But overall I think it's good. It was better than Filmora for me, even though all of this app's features aren't free. But it does have keyframing for free so that was a nice change from Filmora where you had to pay for that."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works, kinda. It's... an OK app, to say the least. It DOES have editing features, but that's just all editing software. Although, I'm not sure if this is just me or not, effects make animated text break. Also, if you have a lot on screen, it lags a lot. (this could be due to poor optimization, but it's not that big of a problem.) Otherwise, it works like a video editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One minute a font is there, the next minute it's gone. Makes it difficult to stay on brand. Should be a feature where you can favourite certain fonts for ease of use. Auto captions are sometimes a pain to work with too, if there's a word wrong sometimes it doesn't include what you've typed. Can be frustrating to work with an needs severe imrovements."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of its features that used to be free are trapped behind a pay wall. One minute you can use one effect and the minute the app updates that same exact effect is locked up. For what the app features for editing there is so much of it just locked up, so much so that you would have a better time with some other basic video editor. Additionally their ""new year sale"" is not a sale, it was already $7.99 monthly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is the simplest editing app and it's easy to use. Once you get the hang of it you can make some pretty great things. But since tiktok and it have been doing so much and all the template stuff they have been getting money hungry. Everything is pro now and it's making it hard for long time users because most editors have a style and rely on specific effects. And then out of no where it's only for pro. It's very frustrating.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has grown to be very frustrating, with most of its features locked behind a pay wall. Capcut Pro is expensive and out of reach for people who don't want to spend $129.99 a year and $13.99 for a monthly subscription. This app had great features, in my opinion, but the price is ridiculous to get quality benefits of this app. At almost every click, there is a feature that is locked. Although, without capcut Pro being such a big issue in using this app, the editing features are ok."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I sometimes use this to edit my animations but recently the app has become very laggy. It's become very slow ever since they started adding more junk at the start that eats up the loading speed. I miss back when the only button I ever saw when opening was just 'new project' and nothing else. It was simple. Everytime I try to add a video longer than 10 minutes to my project the app crashes. I was really hoping to put together a speedpaint video but it's just not working out :(
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I Recently used this editing app to create a project and added a long overlay to my video. However, I was disappointed when the video froze after saving it, which really annoyed me. It's frustrating to put effort into a project only to have it ruined by a technical glitch. I hope the developers of this editing app take note of this bug and work on fixing it. It has the potential to be a great editing app, but the freezing problem needs to be resolved."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This editing app is really good it has many free accessible tools for edits. Along with many customizable features for the frame size, and the image quality for export. It also has many premade edits you could use. I don't mind that the edits have the watermark on them when exported but my only problem I've had issues with was that the kroma key wasn't popping up so I couldn't use any green screen stuff. Besides the one issue for me everything else is really good and I would recommend!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So... Um. How do I say this? This app was deleting my files. I was editing when the app crashed (like it does frequently üò°) and when I loaded back up the project it said the clips where gone. I checked my files app and, sure enough, they had been completely wiped. They weren't even in the trash bin. No idea how that happened. Also, I accidentally clicked a feature labeled pro, and I had to look through all 70 clips in my project because the stupid program couldn't just tell me where I used it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I try to edit it changes my timings, so I have it perfectly timed, I go back and check and its out of time. I do love Capcut though, very good app would highly recommend, but please fix this. üôè thank you üòä OOP! gotta edit this again, another issue! Going down to 1 üåü, when I use text boxes, it adds words I didn't type, extras, randomly and you can't delete them so I have to grab a whole new textbox, and you have made everything useful pro now! Please fix this, cheers üëè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is decent but not without it's own set of bugs. I edit most of my videos with a different software on my PC. That being said, paying the full version is not only expensive for the usability and present bugs, but makes no sense for someone in my situation. I would rather pay to unlock certain features for an app I use on rare occasions."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I only have two problems that bug me, one: Some of the pictures I use get blacked out, no matter if they are not inapropriate. I'll be using pastel or Kuromi things in the edits and they be blacked out. Two: Most of the items are for a membership pass and it's frustrating, but other than that it would have been a 5/5 stars.‚ù§ Love the app and will continue to use it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a really great app for people who want an easy, simple, beginner friendly, app. You can just search up a tutorial online and follow along, if you don't know what to do! Or, you can fiddle around with everything and find out how to use the features on your own! Something I wished I had done early on though, was figure out how to use the green screen. If you want to know, here's how. So go to cutout, then chroma key, then toggle around with the settings."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this editor, however, there are a few bugs. When I add audio, sometimes it doesn't allow me to play it until I close the app and get back in. Another bug is encountered when I try to use the cutout option it doesn't let me use it sometimes. Honestly this is a great app but I would recommend getting the pro version since a lot of the cool stuff are blocked by a pay wall. The PC app is also great."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Starting to get locked behind a paywall, that's not worth it. The app used to be easy and accessible to anyone who wanted to edit stuff, but now they are locking all their basic text animations. Along with that most of the effects and filters are also locked behind that as well. In order to get all that stuff you have to pay $13.99 which is NOT worth it one bit. C'mon the app is full of bugs, and hardly works on devices such as tablet, and computer. Also the app can't support really long videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has made editing so much easier; it's amazing and comes with lots of visual effects, making the edit look even better! It also gives lots of options for example the option to lower or raise your sound volume, which I find very helpful yet a disadvantage I've faced with this app is that all the best visual effects are set in the pros section which is not free and can be annoying at times"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is making me FRAUSTRATED. I've been trying to make mini movies that are usually over 10-15 minutes long and all these times i've been struggling with the fact that if I make a video over five minutes long it will start lagging during playback and sound would get out of sync DURING EDITING. And one more thing, every time I try to switch a clip to another spot, I would have to move alot back just to get it in the beginning of my video. Only good thing is it had alot of features."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! I've struggled trying to find a good editing app for so long! They have templates, and so many editing options. I highly recommend for starters all through pros. The only things that are a little eh is that some fonts make it super laggy to where you cant even watch the video. Also I made a capcut creator application and it took 6 MONTHS to get my results which is annoying. edit: it has been really laggy and makes it unable to watch template videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is REALLY good! It got me subscribers on YouTube and hopefully it will on Tik Tok when I get it! The only bad thing is that when I try to make an edit, like one of the ones where it's someone else's, when I put all the pictures in then watch it and sometimes it's REALLY laggy and glitchy and it's REALLY annoying. For example, I was trying to make the end of 2023 edits and the pictures were going by slowly and it was glitching. But besides that it's a REALLY REALLY good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has always been a good app for me, I have always edited with it in the past few years, but recently ‚Äì trying to find sounds in my devices takes FOREVER, it never happened like that. My internet connection was literally FINE with everything else, I've done tests with whatever app I could ever find that worked online, all good, for a long while it gets stuck with either ""Scanning sounds from device"" or ""No sounds found"" after a while. Absolutely HORRENDOUS with the bugs. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is honestly a really good editing app I've done some edits on it with my drawings and some stuff for my school work and it's simple to use. But recently for unknown reasons almost every single feature takes REALLY long to load. And sometimes it doesn't even load and gives me the dreaded ""No internet connection."" Even though I do have wifi and it isnt THAT bad. Ive tried a couple of things to fix it but no matter what it doesn't work. I can't even draft files because it bugs. Please fix :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey! I've been using this app for over some years, the reason i putted 4 stars was because when you make a clip very short, it automaticallys turn into 1 second and turns black,so i gotta do it over & over again. Another problem is the blue border which appears when you move the pictyre, its very frustrating because it doesnt wanna get putted on the place you want to, so please make a switch on and off about that.And another it makes double videos when i make a vid but anyways, pls fix & thx!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont know what happened but the app keeps getting worse and worse to the point I am seriously thinking to stop using it. For starters the fibt selection for the cover is now written in such small letters, I can't read them to choose! Secondly the speed and retouch selections keep closing when I try to make any adjustments! I have the paid version and used to love it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm gonna be honest here. This app is pretty much flawless. So many amazing things to use that I can't even tell you a fraction of them. I love the CapCut prompter, a feature making short videos so much easier. I also love the massive variety of effects, filters, transitions, templates and so much more. You have to install it. If you don't install it you are insane in the membrane. (Insane in the brain!) Just one thing. DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PAID FEATURE CALLED PRO? do some ads instead guys üò≠"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun app. Lots of good filters. My problem is their lack of control on your personal settings, blocked users still being able to send notifications and customer support being stupid and giving blanket responses that don't actually help anything when trying to reach out to them. Making it sound like it's user error that a blocked person is still sending me messages"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so annoying, everytime I open it it tells me to download the ""latest"" version from another website. And so I did and it's still telling me to download it. I can't do anything and its frustrating at this point."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nightmare. Can't save what I'm working on on mobile app to work on it later. Can't get to do what I want it to do in video editing. They took some features away from the free app within the 3 weeks I've been using the app. And now there's a fatal bug after numerous attempts to edit one effing video from scratch - at least 20 times??? This app is really discouraging me from content creation. Either you do a few quick edits or forget it! Spoke to desktop chat agent last night - that was a waste.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I dislike this app because it keeps sending me a security message and I have to download the app in any devices. After that, I tried to open capcut and it keeps sending me the security message."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had a great experience with capcut. I love the app, and its easy and fun to use, but I have recently been having issues accessing my photos on gallery not all of them show, so it makes it difficult to create videos and use templates because I don't know where all my important photos are. If anyone can relate to this situation or help, it'd be much appreciated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is lowkey not bad, I don't know if its my device but its a bit slow and takes a while to add the request or certain effect on the picture of video but overall its a nice app for editing , i would recommend it ; ]"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good! It makes edits, and it's really fun! Not laggy for me. I personally think that it is great! Very great quality üëå. Just to tell you, I only have had this app for about a year, so if their are bad things about the app, I don't know about them right now. It is good without PRO, by the way."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use it for editing and its decent! But i dont like the fact of almost all the effects are ""pro"" i mean i get you guys want to get profit out of the app but atleast add some more effects which are good into non-pro its really unfair to do this. If this is added capcut will probably be the best editing app there is! (By this review i mean no judgement and no offense, capcut is a great app and many good youtubers,tiktokers,instagram influencers etc use it, no bad reviews added to this review:D;)'"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's okay for the most part, just wish when reverseing clips it didn't take so long cause i enjoy using that feature alot but noticed how long it takes up to hours of waiting till it finally reverses"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"why it shows me again and again that I don't have an internet connection when I do have?? I have my phone data, and I'm connected to a strong wifi. It has been showing me this note in the last 2 weeks, and it is really limiting me with using all features. Im sorry I'm sharing it here. It doesn't even allow me to share feedback through the app because of theexact same problem. I checked all the settings, and settings are all allowed for both data and wifi access. and I updated the app already."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut was one of the best video editing app. There are many options available in CapCut for a cheap monthly fee. However, there are some that CapCut MUST FIX. 1. 2K/4K export problems. Sometimes, when I've done edited my content and want to save it in 2K/4K, the app sometimes crashed, the file format problems, but it's fine when I saved it in 1080p. 2. Chroma key is so bad. It needs a perfect g.screen. Sometimes, I need to do chroma key in other app just to make green screen perfect."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The editing app is good and can make your edits look really good if used properly. However, the only problem I have is Capcut Pro. Now, I was totally fine with this premium side of Capcut. Even though I didn't have it, that was until some free stuff started moving into pro. Seriously? Basically, any of the good free features are becoming part of pro. This has led me to start my nearly finished edits all over again because the effects I used have gone to pro. Please stop doing this Capcut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only application I use the most is Capcut, you can make a lot of videos, photos and more, I'm poor and I don't have money to buy the ""pro"" but I keep using it with the things it has, I really loved using it This application is very simple and it's not even complicated like ""alright motion, video star and etc. Good app foy yall download‚ù§Ô∏èüòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I previously installed it for the first time it had worded but later stopped working i uninstalled it now again i installed it again it worked for the first time now each an every effect downloads 30% and stops. I clear cache tried again but still facing the issue I'll never comeback to capcut again ever.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be one of the best editing apps.. But now I can't say that anymore. While editing or trying to use the audio function, it just freezes.. Don't know if I am the only one experiencing this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give this 4 stars if it weren't for the bad video effects, text glitches, and the fact that you can't drag clips on Android. (Please fix the last part)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good visual effects, but the voice affects are terrible. Where are all the female and male voices? I was gonna go pro but not now. My A.I. work requires various different female and male voices ranging from adults to teens. I'm forced to find a new app. üòñ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The application is great, however, there is a persistent issue with the display of Arabic content, which appears inverted. This necessitates the use of alternative applications. It is imperative that this issue be resolved promptly to enhance user experience and cater to a broader audience."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was okay the first few times but now it won't let me do anything. I srsly just updated the app and yet whenever I opened it, it would send a security notice about needing to update to the new version when I just literally updated it. And now it won't let me do anything if I didn't update it, which I just did"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very useful and once you know how to get the hang of it then your edited video will turn our great; although it is quit hard for bigginers and pretty hard to improve (just my opinion).
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app was quite good until my phone went flat while I was working on a project and once I charged my phone back up it came up with some videos are corrupted EVRY TIME and my phone goes flat a lot HOURS OF WORK GONE. If you forget to charge your phone a lot or your phone battery is small DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. Please fix this issue.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My experience with finding good fonts, presets or transitions has been horrible with capcut pro. Everytime I search for one all I see is capcut pro and not normal ones. Please make it so you can have a non-capcut pro category"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty good. But there are bugs that need to be fixed. The text feature. It is so buggy, I can't even type a sentence without it dupilcating it twice and messing up the whole sentence. It takes so long just to add a text to a video, also sometimes when you finally manage add text without it dupilicating weird symbols appear next to it. This needs to be fixed, adding text to a video should not be this stressful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app, and I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for this problem I've been encouraging in the past few days. The app kicks me out of any project I make whenever I try to add a video or a photo. It's frustrating and very hard to work with. Also, when adding an audio from my files, it takes way too long just to load and show me my files, even lagging at times. I've been using this app for almost two years now. Never thought I'd have these kinds of issues here."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hello capcut, i have had sime trouble getting your app to work because of the unbearable lag. I don't think it's anything to do with my phone so far because it runs alight motion and other apps just fine and besides I've used capcut multiple times for editing and I had no issues with the lag. But eversice I downloaded the new update my screen had suddenly started to freeze. I had to restart it everyone it did that or it will just keep lagging. Edit: thanks for fixing it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wouldve been the highest, but now i hate it. Ive had the problem of all my worl in edits being deleted and telling me that they are deleted and arent in my photo album when i didnt do anythng and i see them on my storage. Ive made many edits and now they are all gone because of a mistake i didnt cause."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app great for editing videos or a group of photos. I am obsessed with the template mode where you can create edits by picking which video you like the edit style of, and you can recreate it with your own photos and videos. The only thing is, on half of the templates I try to use, it is stuck loading. But overall, 100% recommend this app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is incredible, and very easy to use. I make edits of characters, and post them on TikTok. The only issue i have, is when I play the video in Capcut I want to edit, as I play the video, it lags alot. I always have to go in the beginning of the entire video so the lag isn't as bad. If you're able to fix this, please do."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's quite a good app for beginner - intermediate editing, and I see a lot of people use it on YouTube with extremely good end results ( I'll never be as good as them though ) The only annoying thing is how recently, a bunch of the free animations, effects, whatever you want to call them - have become paid, which is really disappointing because they were free before, and it makes editing feel more limited and unnecessarily paid :/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved using this app until i found out that clicking ""speed"" isn't pretty much working, cause I cannot click just because of the phone storage. That's why I don't pretty much prefer this app. If you turn your edits like pictures longer, the faster the video goes. I'd really love it if the 'speed' button can be pressed without anything with the phone storage"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is lowkey good, very simple, and easy to understand. I've been using capcut for about two years now, and it's very rare to come across any problems. The only issue is, almost every good thing is PRO. Meaning you have to buy pro to use it. I get that they are trying to atleast make money, but they should have a ""watch ad(s)"" option, since they said ""capcut is suppose to be a FREE. , all in one tool."" I ain't sayin' capcut is bad. it's very actually good, i recommend if you're starting out."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was fine until it completely when to trash i cant upload videos to instergram now and now any time i try to upgrade the quality of a video it completely stops at 30% and will not do anything else. it was really good, now it's trash."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i've use this app for about 2/3 years however couple months ago i did experience some terrible things such as the search features(whenever i touch the search button, the ""couldn't load. tap to try again"" appear) i'm so mad yk cuz i wanna search the trending stuff but i can't!!! i did uninstalled and installed it for plenty of time. however, nothing changed. idk how to figure this out. and that is why i give 1 star for this app. in fact if i can give 0 star, i wouldn't hesitate to rate 0."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Loved this app until it became unusable. All my projects, even preexisting ones, ""corrupted"" and it wouldn't let me fix it. I had to delete and reinstall the app twice in the span of 30 minutes. Hours of editing down the drain. I tried everything, I cleared the cache, cleared the app data, restrated my phone, looked up solutions, cleared my storage, used different files but nothing worked. It still happened after deleting and reinstalling. I'm writing this in the hopes it gets fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is amazing, I gotta tell you that. But really? 95% of the contents are locked behind paywall, and we are paying for a full app with unfixed bugs, major optimization problems, and I'm not even using this app often tho. Introduce back the system of watching ads to unlock features for 30 minutes of less, or 1 time purchase only deal instead of subscription system that was a waste for people that doesn't use CapCut a lot. Update: Even now simple ""shake"" transition must use Pro. 1 star."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All in all, I think it's a really good app. Everything works smoothly and there's quite a lot of option for editing. The reason it's not getting the full five star is because of the removal of the makeup filters. There used to be some really fun ones, but now I can't find them. Also, this might just be my inexperience, but I can't find the option to actually cut parts ot of videos. You can trim the ends, but in the middle as far as I'm aware, there's no way to cut parts out."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My favourite editing app at all time!! This is my review for CapCut. CapCut is a editing app when you make a editing video or template. I have 2 problems with CapCut. When I slowly moved and zoomed a picture and/or text, it was a little bit glitchy, so I usually stared at a picture and text while I moved and/or zoomed a picture and/or text. Also, that was too many ads when I exported my video or something, as well as premium version box. That's all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so hard to work with. Lots of things just dont work right at all! Such a waste of time. I was trying to edit a video and it was an absolute wreck, the voice over will either not work right or not work at all. The worst part is that I didnt realise that some things costed money so when I tried to export it, it said these things cost money, so I either had to not export it until its paid or go back and change it. So thanks CapCut your a real great app!üôÑ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was great App. But now it's to Hard to use. It takes huge time to just Add a video clips. i have to even wait for min to just add music to my videos.Perfomaced has too downgraded.Too much Dissatisfied with this service
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,everything is good except the pro version is really annoyed me. i thought this will be a free apps but not. yea i understand you need a money too but too many features that need a pro ugh üíÄ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is honestly one of the best mobile phone video editing app i have ever witness. I speak this from the botton of my heart, and this is because of the availability of great editing tools and feature like the transition, effects couple with the ultimate user friendly interface of the app. I do hope in the future the app will support Urdu and Arabic input as of now it doesn't support them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,CapCut is a great editing app! There's lots of effects to use and it isn't at all confusing but there are some issues. There's CapCut Pro which limits the resources you can use for edits.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently I downloaded Capcut again to make some edits like I used to three years ago. Unfortunately no matter what I option I choose such as animations, it always has an error and says that I don't have an internet connection despite my net working pretty well. I'm not sure if this happens because I live in Iran or maybe it's filtered but I'd like to see where the problem is. I've tried different vpn's too but none were helpful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I gave this app 4 stars, is bc i cannot splitscreen with it which makes multitasking harder. For example I wanted to find a clip I wanted to use from YouTube, and dont know if its going to fit in the time frame of my edit. When reversing, extracting audio, or something that needs time to load it gets very boring, Makes me want to watch something while I wait, but its hard to do that without a second device or splitscreening."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has been amazing. However, I do have some concerns as a vlogger. When you want to adjust lengths of texts, no options for till end of clip like some other competitors, also when you rotate a clip, then want to crop it, it shows up in the original format e.g 9:16 instead of 16:9 thereby making the editing process difficult. I'll update my review once I notice changes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely terrible. I just wanted to make some edits but the audio is continuously off from the video. It's not even added audio it's the ORIGINAL VIDEO AUDIO and it is off by full seconds. There is nothing to fix it and I know it's not a downloading error because the original video's audio lines up fine, it's just when it's on this app. This is extremely frustrating and I don't know what to do."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely adored this app. Fun, easy to use... It's just a good app. Until it stopped working. First, it was just slow, I reinstalled it, and after a while, if I open the app, clicking on something does nothing. It's just frozen. Before this template search didn't work. I'm reinstalling again because when it works, it's awesome."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like most futures of this app except that ,in the auto caption section i can't find Kiswahili language,i know it would be a very great ideal to add that language,it would really help us those that are residents of Kenya and Tanzania ,and most of the eastern Africa community. YOU DO THAT ,THE I WILL GIVE YOU A 5 ‚≠ê"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is Okay but once you use it more it honestly sucks. Im trying to edit a video and it makes all my photos invisible it's really annoying.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Stopped working After A few weeks Wont let me do anything Dont download Edit it works now but It has too many paywalls the only great thing is that it lets you loophole around alot of the effects and the fact that i dont have to put a stupid Watermark on my videos because of a Video Editing software wishes to profit off my Work....
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tbh its a great app! I've been using it for about 3 years now but whenever I export it something happens, It dosent show the video in my gallary and if it does its will be gone in just a few seconds another thing is that if my video's have been in my projects it will randomly just say ""This video is corrupted"".I was just wondering if the creator could fix it plsss"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Actual editing and UI, good, better than Alight Motion for my device. The only issue is the lag. I make timing sensitive edits, and the preview freezes everytime I scroll beyond a snails pace, or go backward... at all. Clearing cache, opening up storage, even clearing data didn't help. The reason I chose CapCut over Alight Motion was that Alight Motion lagged."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I miss the old capcut where exporting a video doesn't need to watch ads or purchase a premium account. These days I need to watch bunch of ads just to export a 1 minute video and it doesn't always work even if I watch a lot of ads sometimes it just glitch and start exporting all over again. I guess it's ok to charge the consumers a little like premium effects or transitions but don't charge us from exporting a video that doesn't even take 5 minutes. What a dissapontment.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut because its free and works,but a lot of the time it really really glitches to the point where i can't start a project. When it started i decided maybe its bc i have to many already existing projects, so i deleted them and it still glitched the only reason i still have capcut is because it can animate words which tiktok can't do. For now im gonna edit on tiktok till they fix this. tiktok doesn't glitch. also a lot of sounds on capcut are deemed copyright to i have no sounds to use"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When it actually works, it's a nice app. Good outcomes. However, this app is so incredibly infuriating. Every single day, I get about ten notifications from Capcup, and none of them are ever for my account. They keep sending me notifications for other accounts. Also, whenever I try to edit a video, it always kicks me off the editor as soon as I try and add a picture or video. Ridiculous."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's really good app, but it is so laggy. I can't do any videos over 24 minutes., and I've already started to clear out my storage, because I thought that was the problem, but it wasn't fix yalls stuff because it's not working.and every single time I try and do the video that I'm trying to edit it, won't let me it just goes to a white screen, and then it goes to the templates, please get on here and find out what it is, because it's starting to really bug me."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is trash. Don't waste your time on this. First of all. When you crop it doesn't let you move it how you want and just locks it in place. And second of all. If your video is anything more than 30 seconds it just lags. I used to use this for videos on my channel but it just crashed when I put in a video in need for effects. And third of all. As you use it it just adds extra megabytes to your storage and you end up deleting it. Don't try this. Just use alight motion or vidma.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I already installed it the third time, yet I cannot continue to edit my videos. It keeps saying that I needed to download it from Google Play and yet I already did! Security notice always pops up and I cannot with this!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really really love this app! But unfortunately, sometimes when i make videos it always crashed even though i had enough place for the video, and the simple 'shake' effect transition was my fav it just annoying the fact that it was Pro now- and sometimes it has lags and bugs alot! When i leave my phone (that was still in the app) for like- a hour or more.. it becomes lagging! But i still love this app!! Just keep fixing the bugs and continue the update!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty good app, easy to use, but one thing that puts me off is the lag. it just stops the entire app. so i expect this issue to be fixed soon. but then it could just be my phone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Personally this app is cool for quick easy edits. But somethings are annoying like not being able to change the music on certain templates or having to have an account to access certain things. What I disappoints me is the fact that I can't see templates when in different countries. Only certain countries allow for templates to be viewed.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best Video editing app I've ever seen and that too free of cost, what the mostI liked about the app is you can add filters to your app, and remove background of your video instantly, it exports video very fast, but one thing I want to add that nowdays it's crashing on long video export, I've tried many time but longer video like (3-4min) is not exporting, please fix this issue.

I wanted to use a sound that's trending I won't tell you. The problem is; I couldn't find the sound. No other popular sounds on YouTube are NOT on Capcut (some are some aren't) which Is a big problem. If this issue has copyright issues I understand. It's just so tiring that I have to extract a sound from a video to have that soundüò´ but good app. üëçüëç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app its actually better than ppl say it is however the reverse button doesn't work which is really annoying as an editor and when i smooth it or whatever its called and smooth the slowed videos it changes the quality so please fix that
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Okay, so it's an amazing app! You're able to use templates, save videos for sound, and even be a creator and get paid! Though the problem is, I just applied to be a capcut creator today, and for some reason, it got accepted immediately, but it said it'd take 1-3 business days. As much as I was confused, I was also kinda happy. Although I keep making templates, and for some reason, it's not letting me post any of them. The button isn't there. I've tried relogging in, nothing. Fix this, please! üôè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This program is very good for editing and for editing videos and photos. You may ask yourself why I gave this program 4 stars because this program does not support Persian language and does not allow you to write Persian language. That's why I gave 4 stars to this program
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"alright, the pro features are quite irritating, especially since just a year or two ago, everything was free. but if you try hard enough and do some things with slight work arounds, you can recreate any pro effect. Still annoying as hell tho. But one thing I cannot stand is all the new updates! There seems to be a new update every week, and it's just over small things, like changing icons, or even making more things pro. Atp, eventually I have a feeling everything is gonna be payed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app would be better if there's no bugs,It's just weird like the sounds are just moving away every single time I just tap them,I need to Make this video quickly bc my school project is happening.So if I didn't Finish this,I'll give this 0 stars (if possible),pls finish the box quickly"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. However... Idk if it only happens on me but it's really hard to position the texts and the overlays on exactly where you want. It is also hard to control their tilt. And also. I don't know if it's the apps problem. But I can't access the font styles, text effects, animations, video effects, sfx, and a lot more either when I'm offline or I was connected to our wifi. But when I'm connected with my friend's wifi, I can access those. Pls help"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Capcut is honestly one of the best editing apps it's really easy for beginners but they won't be able to get the full strength of capcut if capcut is in the right hands and you know what your doing it can be so powerful at it's full potential
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can create my own vid and.. It's so much fun but sometimes i tried to make it but.. I like this app!! It was so much fun! I hope this app will be update on 2025 years!! I really want my followers keep up.. But.. They doesn't follow back... But it's okay! If i want to edit or something i just play capcut and.. I love their own template and it was so cool!! So that's all!! Bye!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been using capcut for a few years now and haven't had any issues until now and it's that only the audio of my edits are saved and not the actual edit and it really bothers me especially when I am collaborating with others.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is, in my opinion, one of the best editing apps I have downloaded, and ye there's so many cool effects that I can use! Though, there's just 1 problem for me. When I look for a sound, example, ""LOOK DON'T TOUCH"" by Odetari, I can't find it anywhere. Please resolve this problem so I can re-download this app to use it again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but I was working on a edit and I went to templates really quick and used one of those ones for a different one and now I can't find the other one I was working really hard on
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to be an absolutely amazing app! However now there are 'pro' features. Which are basically overpriced templates. Like the prices are absolutely RIDICULOUS! Please give us the old update back as now finding effects without pro is basically impossible. I used to love the app and used it for many projects. Please just remove pro and just give us the effects again. Thank you.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I genuinely like using this app to edit and stuff, but something bothers me alot.. why add the pro feature when it's supposed to be a ""FREE"" editing app.. and why is the fonts always changing, I can't find the one font I always use [ edit again: ] now.. it's getting sort of slow?.. whenever I add fliters/effects/overlays the graphs on my pictures just repeat at the end? if you know what I mean. I hope you can fix this sooner or later. (might be a bug.)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When it's good it's great when it's off base it's horrible. An example would be when it's supposed to take a picture of you current day and then show you what you would have looked like in another generation such as the 1930s. The hairstyle in clothing shown for the 1930s would never have been in the 30's. They just throw women into long hair no matter the decade and think that will pass. Maddening. Not sure I'm going to keep this. I waited for it to improve and it doesn't.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Yall used to be the best video editing app. Now you're just pay walling everything, what's next? 99.99 for exporting a video? Why do I have to pay 89.90 for an effect? Not to mention the pop ups and the multiple useless notifications."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the anime and sketch effect! The only thing that bothers me is that when I do a photo to insert, it doesn't show up so I have to close the app and re-open it and I have to find everything again!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app until it asks for your personal ID such as health card, passport, and driver's license for age verification. This resulted in me getting banned, and I'm over 30 years old. I even paid for its Pro version, and I can't get my money back. Stay away from this app and don't give them your private information and look for better alternatives."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm giving 2star because it is helping me on making videos but nowadays it's not work properly there are many kind of problem in this app like take more times to explore and sometimes the video isn't explore and don't add another video
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app sucks really. They make every feature pro. A non-pro effect fps lag or halo blur is now pro. I'm sorry but not everyone has money to pay for it especially 7 euros a month, come on man and some lags still haven't been fixed even tho i have a new device. Almost the entire app is pro now and per month its now like 10 euros. Y'all really think every editor has money üíÄüíÄüíÄ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know, i know that nobody is reading this, but im only writing it because this is the best app that has entered my phone storage ever in life. Im literally shocked here. Dont judge the app from its name or logo design, this is the final app all editors are looking for."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It could've been 5 stars but lately I can't export vids, it keeps crashing when it reaches 27% and idk why. I tried clearing cache, no prob with storage, clearing tabs, rebooting phone and updating the app itself but it didn't even change the outcome. I still can't export videos. I paid for subscripition so I can't have any problems and there's this. FIX THIS. please"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great app for learning how to edit but they made it to where you have to pay to export after so many videos and for me that defeats the purpose. It is user frendly but unless they change that I will be most likley using a diferent app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've been having issues with templates and other Stuffs like loading fonts aswell as effects even when I have wifi connection it's showing no connection but my other apps like alight motion are working just fine!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like capcut. But I'm missing so many features. Like the cut out option. Many youtubers are showing this option but I am missing it. Even tried pro and is not there.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The FREE version of CapCut is awesome, it does so much, it's intuitive and easy to learn and it's packed full of features. It's my go-to app for all video related content. And the cool part is they don't force you to use their watermark it's an option. If you haven't used or experienced CapCut I Hailey recommend giving it a try. I'm confident you will enjoy it and it'll become your favorite app as it has become mine."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but it keeps telling me to update to the latest version, which I already have, and every feature in the app is blocked by this banner which can't be dismissed and doesn't even take you to an accessible version of the app store? What gives?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"EVERY TIME I SPLIT A VIDEO IN TWO AND WANT TO PRESS PLAY, I GET TELEPORTED 2 MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE OF MY VIDEO AND AWAY FROM THE PART I WAS EDITING!!! PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE! It has to do with the Minute and Second timeline above the video editing line. It's a recureing problem that's slowing me down, and frustrating me to no end. PLEASE fix this in an update soon. Otherwise; pretty good app. Would definitely recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's definitely meant for basic video editing. It allows for these cool editing stuff, but don't even think about it cause Capcut will NOT create that video for you. I tried to use the remove background feature to make a donation video, but capcut couldn't even play the video. It was just a blank screen video with the capcuts logo at the end. Even cutecut works faster than this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm NOT paying for a subscription for some basic use of the app. I don't use this to make complicated things, it feels redundant to have to pay to export a small or simple video. What use is an editing app if you can edit but not use the videos you made? The app was fine as it was, to find out I have to pay some $7.99 subscription or $50ish subscription, RIGHT after I finished an 8 second video has put me in a terrible mood. I'd be fine if the subscription wasn't so persistent. Basic function."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very beginner friendly but the mobile app has frequent glitches and its annoying. Having a very difficult time using the editing feature on the mobile app and having a hard time deleting frames and the Capcut stock image feature won't work even with my Pro membership. I definitely will be consulting with other content creators regarding better video creation tools . Considering the mobile version is extremely laggy , it's not worth paying for at all ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but it has a bug. I'm a gacha editor, if u don't know what that is, we make videos about this game. Besides the point, the keyframe block doesn't help much. Whenever I try to use the kryframed, a blue box appears and it moves that, not the video tho. Also, every good effect is capcut pro. Which is greedy of them, and I hate them for it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app very much. I can edit and do everything but it's kinda lagging and then I just can't edit and the result of vid is bad cus of these lags üò≠and pls fix lags and this app will be very good!! ü§ç
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved using Capcut until today, now all of a sudden yiu are not given an option to use the pre video templates for your photos and videos!! I pay the $7.99 a month and now this mess..I will be canceling my membership very soon!! Very highly upset about this change..not sure if it's a good change though..hope you guys change it back the way it was prior to today."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the app wont even let me open it. i've updated the app but it's still stuck in the same screen. i've tried reinstalling this app but it's still stuck in the same screen again. please, fix this problem then i will give 4 more stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Three stars when I try to use it on a old device it like crash or lag it would just be blaring and glitching hard to load. But on a new device it's the best edit things pretty good
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"there is a bug, it's called, security notice, and it says I need to download the capcut on play store, but I already download it, please remove it, now I don't use capcut because of that bug, I kinda hate capcut now, I am very disappointed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really like using this app for editing my videos and stuff like that, but now this app doesn't even work well at all. For example, whenever I use text to speech the text just suddenly disappears entirely and I can't get it back. Another thing, it's really hard to edit anything anymore without it lagging. I suggest a different editing software for everyone because this isn't as good as it used to be."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm giving it 1 star because it's been month that I'm unable to save my videos in one go. It takes many turns to save any video. The video stops by itself to be saved and then I have to give the saving command again.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Paying for templates then error and they still charge !! twice i have been charged and twice the Ai has failed sayin no connection which is false as i have full wifi and data no issues this happened before i ignored it assumed one off but its not and you dont get 2nd chance not happy
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a coo and unique way to edit/meme things from your phone! Just wish we didn't have to pay for filters on the app. I just hope I don't have to pay for the other features that didn't require payment before üôèüèΩ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app and it makes editing so simple. My only issue is how glitchy it is. The app crashes so often and its so hard to use it often makes my experience very annoying. The text glitches and adds extra words so much, I can't replay videos anymore. I used to go to this app when my other editing apps crashed but now it's just to glitchy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very simple but efficient app with no watermark for free! It offers you to use a lot many toold for free. Now they added AI and templates so it's even better. But you need to fix a few bugs. Also, I want you to add some more tools like 'text to speech' also with 'different voices for speech'. I'll be waiting for this update!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Idk if it's only me or you guys have ever experienced this ; when I go to effects and I want to pick pixel art (for example) and when I click that I can't, is this a sort of bug or something? And no not for the first time I ever experienced this but multiple times when I tried to edit"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have loved using this app to edit videos for social media but I get ads for capcut premium. That's not a big deal because I might subscribe however I can't justify paying for more features when I can't even search on the app. Every time I try I get ""Couldn't load. Tap to try again"". I've tried all the common advice from Google. It's updated, cleared cache, cleared data, uninstall and reinstall, got close to my route just to see if that would help. Imagine paying money for an app you can't use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut is a really great app but recently I can't find the music or background sounds in my saved templates which is leading to an awful experience ü•≤
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not happy about how the remove background feature isn't working how it used to. I click on custom remove background, and use the brush to remove it. But it keeps moving were I put the brush to the left. Weird...."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is great and all. It works perfectly. But when I tried applying I got rejected the first time and I tried again when I could and it's been 3 to 2 months and they don't reply and just assumed I was under 18.. when I fr put a year above 18 years old.. I feel that any age should allowed to be able to make templates tho cuz your just assuming people under 18 are bad or something If you won't allow people under 18 to post templates, it's so mess up.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As an editor of three years, Capcut is amazing for beginners. Most notably, it has no watermark. Premium features can be accessed by watching ads. However, the preview can get worse the more clips you add, and it's rather limiting to what transitions you wish to make. But overall it's a great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It was soo great but from last 2-3 weeks it has been soo many glitch can you please fix it.... I can't even open it because of this.... I can't even able to edit any video.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Smooth slow motion features doesn't work like the older version anymore.Now it's become very choppy.Second thing, Sometimes pitch audio options doesn't show up when I slow down/speed up the video/audio."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app lags a lot and it affects my editing. That's my only complaint, the ap features are great and all, I just wished that it wouldn't lag so much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the heck did just happened?? You know this is a good app BEFORE until starts becoming worst why? Cuz first lagging, glitching and the worst part is when I use effect or transition or templates it says no internet connection.... EVEN THO MY INTERNET IS GOOD!!! This update is just sucks that's all"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"what the hell happened on capcut? Theres too much bug. Like sometimes, when i try to extract an audio, it doesnt work! Then when i try to put some text, it sometimes gets erased. Then now i tried to search for a song and it says ""no internet connection please try again later"" even thought our internet is in good state. It was like that for almost 2 weeks thats why i decided to comment it down here. Ive been using this app for a very long time thats why i got disappointed on how it got changed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A good app overall with lots of great features. Reason I don't give five stars is the app becomes slow when using lots of effects and vidoes/overlays at a time, the preview becomes out of time with how the video actually looks, and the more you add the slower it becomes. Plus now all the good features seem to have been turned so that you can only use them by purchasing pro. To the point that simple effects like text fade in is now a pro feature that you have to pay for. Good app but needs work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bruh this editing app has a lot bugs like seriously üíÄsome of the cool transitions are now even pro the devs are like""no more free thing we need more moneyü§ë""bro a lot of people is changing to a different editing app because this app is pay to edit but the are free to edit this is one star for the bugs and pro features i loved this when it was free but now no more love for capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! It let's you edit so much and it's fun! You can meet so many nice people on here, and their is so many different types of editing styles! Definitely recommend!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing, perfect to edit anything, but it's wont let me add most the videos I have, it acts like they aren't there, but when I go to Google photos they are there, when I go to albums it shows I only have 30 videos, but i have well over 140. It's annoying because it wont let me use the audios I have saved. I have to re-save all the audios, and recently I figured out it they are over 3 weeks old capcut wont show them"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app was working fine for about a week or so. For some unknown reason the app had logged me out. Now no matter what I do it's saying I'm on a 7 day free trial even though I have a receipt for the ¬£74.99 I paid for the whole year. Very unhappy and will never use ever again. Will stick to inshot. I've essentially been robbed of ¬£75 !!!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's not that I don't like it, it's just a bit laggy and all but other than that the pro option is a bit much, I have good editing idead but I need the pro options most of the time and it bugs me that I have to pay just to have a pro feature. At least make it free for a while then charge or give people a free chance to use those options for like 2-3 months (Update) Ok si it stopped being laggy but the thing is that when im using a template the loading effect thing gets stuck at 30%"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, used it for quite a few years, lately its been laggy and horrible to work with, text is glitched and every good feature is becoming pro and its an extremely expensive price for just a few features that i will actually use. find a better editing app before you use this one, yes it is simple and easy to understand but there are plenty more with a lot more variety of effects and text transitions."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Needs to fix some bugs. Sometimes, it'll freeze a frame for a few seconds of the video, and there's no way to fix it. It now doesn't let me edit without an update that doesn't exist. Also, it isn't an app that should need the internet to work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wsh i could rate this 0 stars, really bad editor some files you could not even add, the sprit option does not split where you select it to split, preview videos are very laggy and buggy, worst editor i have ever used video Guru way better option"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this editing app for years and I like it, not until capcut pro came. at least half of the effects and text animations that i had been using for years suddenly had that shiny little annoying rectangular-shaped with the text ""Pro"" in it. I mean, I was okay with the texts thingys but, the effects? nope. The effect called ""Smart sharpen"" which I've been using for months‚Äîor a year‚Äî,recently had that shiny rectangle ""Pro"" thing. I hate it, pls bring back smart sharpen,I need it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Over-all the app is good and has a few nice features, however it's not entirely free and has a lot of things that you have to buy ""pro"" to use. It has a few bad glitches. Also it collects an unreasonable amount of information about its users, which they then also sell. The projects I make have to be constantly updated which uses cellular data. updates are too often and take up quite a bit of data. Because of all this I am switching to another app that won't take and sell my information."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wish I could give this a minus one. Was too glitchy and I can't access the speed because I have ""beats"". I have never used that feature. Also, deleting accounts is very hard and you basically have to uninstall the app. Whenever you move clips around, it makes sure to chop off half of the clip because the app wants you to have ""creative fun""."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Capcut is so bad because I can't edit properly with this stupid bug/glitch! This bug/glitch annoys me because when I add videos in my edits it keeps going to template I try again add a video to my edit template again so I'm moving to another editing software goodbye capcut.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would be better, seeing as I can't upload 400 screenshots to make a video, but the video is taking less screenshots than what I took. Update: it's a good app, however they way some screenshots get imported, they don't fill the entire screen one time but they do the next on a new project where I need them on the previous project. So what I'm saying is you should be able to make a vid with pictures that are long and side ways without it having a black border. Fill it in without cropping."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut used to be an amazing app, and now it just sucks. I post edits on TikTok, and it is close to impossible to edit on capcut now. When I first got it, it was completely free, with no ads, now most of the features I need are only available for pro members, and the app is riddle with ads. Get Funimate, Alight Motion, or Video Star if you need a editing app, capcut is not worth your time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to like Capcut. But, I now just noticed that most of the effects are pro along with everything else. Like what???ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And second, Capcut isn't really telling the truth about this app being free. In fact, it's hardly free! So let me get this straight, Capcut expects people to pay their hard earned money but they can't even comment back to these reviews with answers on how to fix these problems? That speaks volumes capcut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's nothing more infuriating than to save audios on tiktok just for it to never be saved on capcut for no particular reason. I would save 10 audios only for 2 out of order ones to save instead like it has some sort of preference. Good luck deleting images/videos while you chose something to be in a video too, because it'll go out of its way to take said image/video out despite the image already being imported into the app. No other app has done it BUT capcut. Better find another app instead."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is nice you can edit videos, edit your photos and much more but recently when ever I type in some words in the text bar some letters don't appear also it's very hard to get songs because there are only a minimum amount that are good for my videos and I have to go on TikTok, get that sound I like but then sometimes it's copyrighted and I basically have no song for my video."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut used to be such a great app before they added premium, there are so many problems now with the app it's ridiculous. The premium is the worst though, before premium everything was free to use but now half of everything is behind a pay wall. I also noticed that free to use effects are now also behind the paywall. Some other problems that it's difficult (on phone) to find non premium animations. Honestly I would find another editing app because how much of a mess this one is."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing for editing but I have been having a problem on which I can't find my pictures. I have tried my best but the photo organization is so messed up. When I click on the plus sign it take me to the page where I find my photos. For some reason all my photos are in the album section even tho I didn't put them there. When I make a new album it doesn't show up. So I cant find the photos/videos I need. These issues make it very hard to use so I wouldn't recommend it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They made keyframes and complicated editing tools purposefully unusable because they want people to pay for their animations. I tried using keyframes to make a simple 'fade in' effect with text, and the app wouldn't let me. I never had this problem before, and immediately realized why I was having it when I saw a custom 'fade in' text affect had been added behind a paywall. Genuinely screw this app, and screw its developers. Horrible experience."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, it is my main editing app and I use this app alot. but one problem about it, is that when you try to make a clip as short as possible, it sometimes turns the clip black and you cant edit any further, this makes you restart again, I recommend to fix this for a better experience. despite that, the app is still good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"NOT LETTING ME IN. The app isn't letting me in, I downloaded the latest update and it's still saying it's out of date. When I click load the update. I get a webpage that is not available. Can you please fix this issue?"

I don't like the ""pro"" version pls fix tge issues ,bugs,and other more!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It should have a way to choose the file's you want and download them to your phone and the space if you want I wold like to mass transfer to my phone it makes it so much easier so use your brain capcut
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoyed making videos on this platform, there's something wrong with it cause it keeps saying it's not secure but it should be so can you sort it out please. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app but I have a problem whenever I see a template I like in TikTok and I wanna make use of it sometimes they would be like add sound in TikTok when I will save the video without the sound the video doesn't play I mean it is playing but just the audio in the background... I don't know if it's me or the app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is the best app I have on my phone, it is so helpful when I want to make funny or heartfelt videos. Sometimes when I want a preview of the video it doesn't show the whole video, but if I export it to my camera roll then it shows me the final video with all of the features I added definitely a 5 star app that I recommend for everybody to use if they are feeling fun and creative in their own way."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,good but its very glitchy and it makes it unusable and very frustrating. one of the glitches is where if you split something it makes it the start of the clip rather than past the point you split it. another is the screen completely freezes on one frame when you split it and you have to reenter the project. these 2 glitches alone make it unusable. It would be amazing if there was an effect where it shakes with motion on the screen. E.g to match the energy of a reload when editing fps games.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's very laggy. When i put like 2 texts on each other it lags a lot and the sound keeps going but i can't place the text on the right moment. I like it though, but it's been like that for a while since the update:/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is the last straw. I was making a video for my school, had uploaded all the footage, and edited it. My phone started to become slow from the space it was taking up, so I deleted it to make room and for some reason that footage in the editor was just GONE. Why is that even a thing in the first place? I'm tired of this glitchy, slow, annoying to work with, piece of dogshit. It just had to be the section I put the most effort in as well. Fix your app for the love of god!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I would like to inform you that I really love to use Cap Cut App. Even I using windows app also. Recently I found a issue while typing in our own language kannada(India) It will not typing properly. Kindly solve the issue so that I can avoid use another app for only for this purpose. Hope you understand my problem and do the needfull.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible. I've been using capcut for 2 years now. But for the last 2 weeks I've been making videos with alote of clips and I discard it. BUT THE SOUND KEEPS GOING ON AND IT GOES ON FOR LIKE 50 MINUTES WITH NOW WAY TO STOP IT!!!!! But then a voice says would you like to export this. DONT GET THIS APP. P.s. there are so many bugs in the capcut system and the ai things are for them to just track you and see what you like probably. Don't get capcut. Horrible experience.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! The motion blur automatic 5 stars for me!.. ‚¨ú Edit: So it's been a year, still using it for my edits. The only problem I have is the quality and the fact my video won't save and I have to take the fps down and it makes the video look horrible. I've tried deleting everything in my phone just for it to not work anyways. -1 star until you can at least make the videos better quality without capcut 'pro', oh and let's not mention half the effects are only for capcut pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""The current version of the app is not secure. Download the latest version in official app stores."" Even though I'm clearly on Android. After it appears the app is simply rendered useless or un usable."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had capcut for a long while now and it's good at editing photos and videos together, however there's a pop up add everytime you click on something. Example: if you are using a template there's a add as soon as you kick it. Another detail I've realised is when editing your video most all of the extra add on features you have to pay for, they are really pushing you to buy the pro version, really annoying!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its okay. It's the best thing I have that's free, but it's SUPER SUPER SUPER laggy almost all of the time. And the pro option is just so stupid, like I get making money and stuff, but if you're going to advertise as a free app, please be completely free. It's nice for what it is, but I constantly have to delete and reinstall the app just for it to work because it's so so laggy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Im done editing my vid then i save my vid, but it cant save my vid always i see my screen when im save the vid is couldn't load, please try again i hope you fix this and while I'm editing some animation lag."

I'll give 5 stars after you fix this. Also why did you make everything pro? A could months ago I could use some of the things that were free but now they're pro? You guys just want money and it's causing problems. Also when I try to add more clips it sends me to the home page and it never adds them. Please just fix this so I can continue editing üôè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a popular video editing app that has become a favorite among creators for its intuitive interface and advanced features. However, recent changes to the app's pricing strategy have left many users concerned. The app has been gradually shifting towards a mostly ""Pro"" version, which provides users with a wealth of advanced editing tools and AI-powered features. While some users may appreciate the additional features, others may struggle to afford the subscription fees of $11.99 USD monthl"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for editing, but a lot of the effects and stuff are all premium. Like I used FPS lag for some time and then suddenly some days later it became premium. Same with the Renoir filter. If you want your app to have success than make stuff free and people would actually use it. Please fix this. (Not only these filter but every effect or filter possible are becoming premium, it isn't fair at all)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for editing. But the idea that you have to have a pro membership in order to use the most of basic edits and functions, like tracking text, kind of defeats the purpose. It's unnecessary monetization and the fact that people have already started to pay for these simple things is just criminal."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"a decent video editing software rendered completely useless. the ""pro"" options clutter up the free options why can't you make it seperate. it's a dumping ground for clashing aesthetic stickers numerous and gaudy. it was fine when I first downloaded this app what happened? you took away the favoriting option and put it behind a pay wall, the most basic of options. greedy. and the stuff that's pro is not even an upgrade it's still a mess. there are better options out there."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"hey i have an issue, so I can't search for the template I want, when I click search something will appear ""Couldn't load, please try again"" I've cleared cache, cleared data, but it's still like that. please fix it in my Redmi Note 10 Pro üôèüèª"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is the most simplist editing app in the whole entire world, capcut let's you explore into deep depth of editing whilst using your phone !!!!! I highly suggest caput to any youtubers, editors etc. Anyone can use capcut for there own virtual experience."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's amazing how after 1 year of using this app the Arabic text problem is still not sorted. The Arabic text displays incorrectly. This is the only reason stopping me from purchasing the pro version
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is a really good editing app, but for some reason, it's just a little bit glitchy... When I make a project and add a really long video as a overlay, it freezes and it goes back to the main lobby, and I have struggles with finding my saved tiktok albums/sounds. Please fix this and it's more worse with my anger issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,No way to sort audio local files. Search audio files in local folder also not working properly. Overall good app. With small fixes can be much better.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much. It's beginner user friendly for anyone to make any kind of content. The mobile version is great for shorter vids but the pc version blew my mind with it's latest voice cancelation update. If capcut chooses to go behind a pay wall it'll hurt my heart but considering how good and easy the user interface is I'd understand and probably pay cause it's so good. Been using it to edit videos for a year now and I've never looked at another app again
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app it's okay but my problem is whenever I export a video it will directly send to tiktok, and it annoys me because I don't want it to be automatically send to tiktok it's so annoying"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible I would barely able to do anything and I try to use it for downloading videos and then watching it soon after it takes way too long to download them and it has too many ads too I don't know if anyone has ads but apparently I do somehow
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you so much Capcut for putting in so much work making a great editing app that's FREE!! Your team must surely be wonderful and I hope the free version stays this way for many years to come. It's rare to see such a quality product that is easy to use, extensive in It's capabilities and without a bunch of ads whilst being free xo Bravo and Thank you! :)))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was good but whenever I do motion blur or slowmotion it turns orange, and then sometimes the slowmotion or motion blur won't work even tho if my wifi bars are full."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so basically. If none of you have experienced the new update, it basically gives you the option to post the video, which means you have to be a cap cut creator and the other option is making it a GIF. Whatever you make it a GIF the quality doesn't turn out like it used to cap cut. Please bring back the old one where you can actually like make a video and save to your device without having to download a gif and having the low quality."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been using the app for more than 2 years now and it's really great. I would still like if there would be an option to make 3D edits too though...
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's good when it works. I Don't like that recently my capcut has been lagging alot when I put emojis on a text it puts the enter text on top or a c or something and it's very annoying when I put an animation on the text it becomes really slow and then speeds a certain part of the video and then it gets so annoying and makes the video look bad, as a roblox editor it's more easier to edit with capcut cuz there are easier controls but idk why it has been showing me these stupid lags and bugs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bug: showing ""current version of the app is not secure"" i tried reinstalling from play store and still shows the same. Dissapointing. üò©"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well, my experience has been decent. And I like the app. But it won't post my remakes. Says they'll be under review. It's been a week, 4 remakes haven't posted. Like someone help me. And it won't let me send screenshots on the agent chat for someone to help me. What the heck?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Responds to constant issues people are having, with ""free to use with no adds, free to export, if you use the free editing tools"" they know exactly what they're doing. Make the Free tools unclear between"" premium ones"" have people invest a lot of time editing first video, they see they can't export free, because they used premium tools to edit, they are disappointed and spent so much time, they are invested.. so they pay. they just don't wAnt to be sued, so "" Technically"" they aren't lying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, its very easy to use and learn the editing is good, the quality is good but one thing why im not doing 5 stars is because this capcut pro subscribtion its just like almost everything is for pro which is pretty annoying, if capcut makes less things for pro i will rate 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used a template called: what would I look like in the 80s... And I have to say I was amazed at the transformation the app produced. It seems like that the software is really sophisticated, it was able to produce a real likeness of myself. I have to say it's a picture that I'm going to use to inspire myself to recreate in reality for myself. I rate this app five stars no question! What took capcut 1 minute of computer magic to achieve is going to take me 9 months in the gym and a ¬£1,000 suit !"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the app but honestly nowadays it keeps crashing I can't even edit my video or even use a template properly because it keeps crashing. That has to fixed, cause seriously this app is good but keeps crashing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Text is even buggier now. Moving text or images around is AWFUL. They don't move freely and they snap in awful places. The text should break like automatically, it makes writing a lot horrible. There's another bug that adds random letters to your text, copied or new. They cannot be deleted and you have to delete the whole text and make another."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was very happy with it, but my pro subscription hasn't synced with my app, and I don't know how to do it. Whenever I click on ""Pro"" I get an error saying I'm already subscribed but I can't use any pro features. I'm paying for a service that doesn't even work. How do I fix this?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I use a template, the sound doesn't match the video or supposed to be the movement or what it's supposed to be like when it's exported , the sound comes first and then the video is very slow literally very slowww, but when you export it and look at it, it is literally what you watch is what you get. It comes up fine but the moment that you will fix a little thing in the template, it's just a big problem"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was actually loving it, until it ruin my project because there is no option where I can group the multiple layer. When I add a new clip all the 2nd layer did not move. It only waste my time, I hate this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mean, its a good editing app. I have used it for years now. But I hate how everything is now only for pro, like I remember a bunch of features being free and then boom you have to pay for them. I just think its stupid to make it so you have to pay for everything. Overall good app!<3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Well, it was okay but when i started to do flash in on speed its started to say Applying Feature. And i just pressed the better quality. It was so fast that time but when i press it. It took so long and capcut automatically shut down. It was 4 mins and when i opened it. Everything became normal except for the Applying feature. So disappointed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,really good app but there is only one issue. when ever try to make animation on my overlays the dam thing doesn't even move like how am I suppose to edit my videos if the animation thing doesn't work by animation I mean the Dimond shaped object on the screen. and now the only way I could do this is just by splitting the clip and move the clip around which is a huge pain in MY hands.Thanks for reading
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but when I'm trying to type something it lags so much.

It doesn't delete and I have to restart again. I have been using this app for such a long time but it's so annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for some time, but the security notice said that I have to update or download it or wtv, I tried checking it and there's no ""update"" or something like that.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Is so so bad after the update, when I go back to see the video it keeps lagging/begging and i can't see the cut I've made, this has to get better. And the amound of effects, transitions to buy is crazy, the most basic one (right and left without the black space betweet, that I think it's supposed to be transparent but doesn't work for me, only has the right for the free version)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Disappointed üòû Lately been having trouble using this app to create trendy videos for tiktok. Its now asking me in order to use it further to pay monthly for it. What is going on with social media apps lately? All I have to connect with friends is social media üíîü•∫ and I wanna use this but not at the expense of my wallet. This is so heartbreaking üíî
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine in a pinch, but has become so much more restricted over time. Things that were originally free have become unable to use unless you pay, and it's not like 75% of options aren't already behind a paywall, so what's the deal?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Well this is very great app and so useful we can edit videos with our friends and make memes on it the best part is we can do it on the youtube we can put it on the youtube and thats great but the thing that i hate is the premium thingy i have been more than 5 hours making on a video at end it said u need to pay premium or whatever it is but its a nice app everyone needs to install it there r also movies we can watch there and tyyüíóüíó
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If i could rate this 0 stars i would. Seriously what the hell is wrong with this app?

Its seriously so irritating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm gonna rate this app 5 because of its smooth and efficient editing options! I've been using this for three years and never got disappointed especially for my game editing purpose. But the thing I want to mention here is that AI movement is hella crazy!ü§Ø I mean for real it takes the video from nothing to EVERYTHING!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is good editing app but actually it's not because when I start editing somehow the start speeds up and then the rest not at least the other parts are not speed up but the first part always speed up

I use other editing apps that work amazingly on my phone but this one keeps lagging and glitching with a simple ten second edit. It has become useless and so expensive, bring back old capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am really enjoying the capcut video editor before but since September 2023 it became buggy. Reporting a bug: Auto closes capcut app when I turned on the auto back up to cloud space. Flickers to some video even if there should be none. I hope Capcut can fix and improve. Also a better sync with the mobile app and pc app would be appreciated. Just enjoy exploring na lang.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Well, this app has been my best editing app but suddenly I really don't like the update. Back then, some features in capcut needs to be download and you can use it even offline. But my biggest regret is that, when I update this app it change a lot. Everytime I use some features (e. g. Animation, Filter, etc.) even though I'm done downloading it. It only says ‚Äòno connection‚Äô. Please fix this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There needs to be an option to select multiple objects and clips.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best editing apps! I love the templates they have, which are great because you just have to insert a photo(s) or video(s) and it will do the editing for you. But you can also use effects and more.

Screenshot-to-screenshot videos arent that bad but i seriously think they should do a better job with the effects and tweening. The symmetry centering is also very annoying since no watter what you do you cant put something in the right place because the centering is right next to it. Hope they fix these.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good (mostly for edits), but I don't like how like half the stuff is a subscription thing. Another con is that it'll take up around 1GB of storage (another reason why I'm uninstalling). Other than that, I love this app, I've used it for around a year and it's served me well. I would recommend if you don't mind the cons."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First ever experience using this app because I wanted to try a TikTok filter I saw... I installed the app and made an account just to be told ""the original template is unavailable."" Ok, sure... But then every single template I tried was either ""unavailable"" despite showing in search results or the app simply won't let me apply them to any pictures/videos I have. Online tutorial videos don't even address these issues. Stupid waste of time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app for editing. We can crop videos, make videos blur, many effects, many voice efdects, auto caption, auto crop full of important things. In my Point Of View, one of the best editing apps on the planet earth."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like capcut it's really easy to use and it's sertanly the best free editing app, key word 'free' cuz not everyone can afford alight motion pro or after effects. I've heard people saying that capcut is making a lot of the effects pro but it's still free to me so I don't know whats up with that. I would rate it five stars but here's why not: It would really be helpful if they made an animation for the text to appear word for word and I can't use keyframes with coloring graphs but still enjoyable"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be a fun editing app for everyone and though this is probably the best mobile editing app you can get it's not really worth paying for pro. The screen lags as soon as I import over 80 screenshots, if I use green screen it's terrible quality, the music is never elined, you have to scroll for effects cause the search don't work, and finally they advertise every time you click a button. I may use this app but I do not recommend. It used to be better than this ü´§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the Capcut video editor for editing TikTok videos but, as of this week, it is incredibly glitchy. It keeps on moving things (or me!) about the page as I'm trying to work, to the point where it's a battle to edit with it. If the glitches are fixed, then this is a great video editor."

Also the app glitches alot sometimes when I check on my projects that I already saved and then I can't find it anymore for example I saved a edit yesterday and now I can't find it anymore. I really hope you fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good for editing and all, but.. When I add a little more of drawings or texts, it lags it doesn't help. Sometimes,.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a good app, but the new update gets under my skin. Whenever I put an animation for a clip >5 it won't let me adjust the animation and forces it to go throughout the entire clip which makes it hard for me to edit. Also all the good effects are becoming pro, but this is supposed to be the best FREE editing app? I enjoy capcut which is why I only deducted 2 stars. Please fix this."

It takes away from the posting, which is for our business. It's very frustrating for one, shouldn't have that issue as a paying member, and two, never get customer service.

So i deleted the old video but I didn't delete the Texts and other effects.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is full of microtransactions even though it was completely free not even a full year ago, cap cut is only proving that once again all apps care about is money they don't care about their users as long as they can make a quick buck they don't care so they'll shove as many microtransactions down your throat as they possibly can, cap cut took a decent app and made a trash one, Good jobüëé"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing to use for editing but I have a problem why it not a 5 star reason why is the straight line that auto puts the area where it wants it to be when I am not specifically putting it there, the other reason is that whenever I click the sounds and then try to get music for my editing it takes a while to load and always crashes Capcut. it‚Äôs constant, hope its fixed immediatly.

After spending hours editing a video it wouldn't even let me save it to my phone or share it. I'm done"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,One thing that I didn't like about this app is that when ever you use a template and download the video the watermark appears on the created video.So there should be no watermark videos in which we have used template.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the templates and stuff!! The only reason I won't rate it a 5 is because it almost always says no internet, even when my internet is full, and it keeps saying that for multiple days.

Make it a one time payment, or better yet. Go back to when it was free instead of whatever this is, cause you can't even use any good effects anymore cause of the payment bs.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but I gave it 4 stars because once you edit it becomes very laggy and I was trying to make a good edit and it lagged and made me start over but the best part is that you can watch the templates to either give you ideas or to copy off of and the worst part is that you have to pay a lot of money on the pro things, before you were able to do a lot of things.

Even basic features are locked behind a subscription for CapCut Pro. And the app isn't even that good to warrant it.. üëé Would be good if they loosened up on the subscriptions. But they never will, as long as the people buy it. Oh well. :/ I'm still going to use it, anyway..."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app for making videos. The Fade In/Out effects however are very buggy as they create momentary blurring affects on the video. With some adjustments, you can get rid of them from the fade in but you can't get rid of them from the fade out making these effects unusable."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every time I try to export my video it says I used something from capcut pro. But when I try to remove the pro thing.

But the option available is only ""2k/4k"", please make them separated. Cause when I select this option, the video will be exported at 4k. The video I imported is 2k only, so I want to export at 2k only, so please make them a separate option. Don't merge them. Also, we can't draw shapes? What a shame."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ok, I have a confession to make...cap cut was an amazing app intill they made almost all the good effects pro. My most favorite filter was called ""Yandre"" I would always use and it always worked perfectly, that was intill it became pro. Cap cut if you're reading this...some people just don't want to buy pro effects, and there's a reason they don't. So pls don't ruin an amazing experience like this and to have the freedom to edit. So please, atleast bring back the yandre filter. Thank you!"

But the only flaws that the app has are some cool tripping effects are ONLY for paying users, and at first the app was for everyone not needing to pay. My other issue is the templates, they are nice for new commers to try there best but in my opinion the only reason why people have the app is only to use templates without trying.

But now all the transitions I love and would always put on my edits I have to pay for. If I'm not being paid to make edits why should I have to pay to make them?

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A while ago I would've given CapCut 5 starts because it was super easy to edit with all the resources (like affects and animations) but now it's kinda weak because you've made practically all the good stuff pro when they didn't used to be and now I can't edit well. It would be really cool if the affects that used to be free were free again.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app a lot, it has many great templates and all but why is it banned in India?! I don't get it!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever happened to the audio?!! When I upload a video, it slows down the audio so it sounds like an ailen trying to speak in the space - if you know what I mean!

Please DO fix it ASAP or I'd like a refund asap!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is amazing app. But there is one problem when you replace a clip or graphic. It replace with default settings not the settings of replaced clip. Like old clip was with small size and on right top side. But the new replace clip will appear in centre with large size. That weird!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the best app to use if you are a beginner because it's simpler than other video editing apps. Sometimes when duplicating audio, overlay, or parts of the main vid you have to click the button several times for it to work. There is a slight delay sometimes between audio and images."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Didn't expect much but actually... this is brilliant. I use the desktop version too, and it's never crashed, never had an issue and just feels really intuitive, especially for Reels and TikToks. I've almost stopped using other software which I never thought would happen."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, perfect for editing except for afew things you could change 1. Maybe put real music into the audio stuff instead of tunes and instrumentals 2.abit more of editing styles as some that i put dont fit in 3. Maybe alittle more affects as editings puts lots of work and if someone if looking for a effect that isnt there then how would they make it???

The only workaround is to delete all data but should i delete all my projects just for one clip??? I have clear cache, cleared my phone cache, turn internet on and off but nothing changes. There is no way to save editable version either so you cant delete all data if you want to keep those drafts"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I've used capcut for 3 years editing for my youtube channel, and it has done me fine.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App crashes a lot and can be cumbersome to use. Once you've used the app for a while a lot of the templates repeat themselves or only have minor differences.

It has a text glitch at version 9.9.x and at 10.3 it got real bad during the editing process of auto caption (it's very glitchy, I've to reopen the app to fix it temporarily before it appearing again) This app used to be a great video editor for android, but unfortunately each update only brings new and more bug"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Thr appbis best. I've been using it for a long period of time. The only problem that made me sad is it has not search options in sticker and some other Categories and no saving of text style which would make editing subtitles much easier.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is great but the reason for my low review is because as of recently it speeds through my clips without me speeding them up, it fails to play extracted audios and after export the video will not play. I find it very hard to edit when the program used is failing like this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hello, I'm a CapCut Creator and I'm hopeful that CapCut can address a specific issue. While I don't encounter problems with effects transition, lagging, or exporting, I face a challenge when uploading templates ‚Äì it consistently gets stuck at 39%, sometimes requiring up to 6 hours of waiting. This delay hampers my ability to post templates and diminishes my motivation to do more. My phone and internet is not a problem at all. I hope CapCut can swiftly address and resolve this problem. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate this there is to many bugs while I'm trying to make videos/edits I cannot do it because of bugs so I have to delete and reinstall it again to actually edit it again I lost so many edits and one edit that took 1-2 hours and it still wasn't done after I recorded a video I went to capcut but then there was a bug that I cannot stop making the video long it reached 40 hour so I had to delete it and reinstall it and after years I installed it again and the photos wont load!! And there many bugs
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I shared it and did not get a free al Transpate and I got to share everything eveytime just to use if it works right üòí or pay so much for a free edit app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the free version for 3 weeks now and I really enjoy it, has a lot of options to choose from and you can create beautiful videos with just from your pictures..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"give too much ad Not everyone has that much time Even if you want to give an ad, make it small. Thank you so much"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app üòÅ I recommend it for editing especially for students with their presentations and other things. But it has bug or something but when it saves and when I check it the next day it doesn't work anymore, the video doesn't play it just shows like it's not available or something."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"How am I suppose to edit/use templates when I won't allow me to upload photo, it just keep on saying ""no media yet"".....I already check my network and it's just fine"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be my fav editing app but now can't use overlays or stickers. It crashes the project every time. Plus the ai image editor used to be free all the time. Now you only get a couple uses before the option disappears completely. Updates are supposed to add enhancements and beer stuff - not lock previously free features behind pay walls. This is why I hate updating apps. Worse ""update"" ever. If it's not fixed I'll be uninstalling soon"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cant find any way to change so that effects arent effected by ""global"" keyframes or whatever you call them. So if you wanna color edit you should do that before any other, otherwise its basicallly impossible to do it in an easy way. Edit: now volume is bugging out and cant be changed Next problem: Capcut keeps sending spam notifications which i cant find a way to turn off. I needed to block app notifications in my phone..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Been using this app for the longest time. So far so good. Very easy to use especially for a beginner in editing.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello, my name is Vitor. I installed CapcutPro and signed for one week trial period,after which I'll be charged the full year subscription amount. But I'm not really satisfied with the app and won't sign the contract. But the thing is I cannot find where in the app I can cancel it. I logged in and it only shows me me some subscribe option. It won't show any cancel trial or subscription option. I'm schedule to be charged in two days and can't afford it. Could you help me and cancel the trial?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Overall very good editor maybe even the best! (For phone) but the reason it's 3 stars is the fact that on my phone a glitch keeps popping up very commonly where text in templates and projects sometimes alters or removes something or adds something Example: I was just making a something and in the text one of the words was someone but it put 2someone or later I was typing have and then it just didn't realise I put an e this stuff isn't common but it's very common with spaces overall it's a 3.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the new update, I have had many issues with this app. I've had weird colour errors on the video after exporting. The app crashes after 20 minutes. The app keeps Fast Forwarding When I'm not pressing the button. It's all over the place really üòÖ. I kinda hate this app now. . Yall are taking the mick with this EDIT: okay so im starting to get this unsecure version download from offical downloads error whenether downloading capcut... this has happened for atleast a few weeks now"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,since the last update I always get so frustrated with capcut because texts get deleted and moved when I crop or move clips. It really makes editing a pain because I often have to do these things with the clips but don't want the text to be changed. PLEASE MAKE IT SO THE TEXT DOESN'T GETS EDITED WHEN I DO SOMETHING WITH THE CLIPS!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The picture frequently getting the black screen instead, leaving them out off some important videos, not just that, cropping pictures refused to save already, systwm that also freaking lied that I used Pro feature that I didnt even used and ended up abandoned that project instead, that happened for more than a year of using, and writing this means actions needed to fix these bugs"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app it is just the things where you have to pay they need to change it.but over all I do recommend this app for funny and awesome stuff üòú.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great for editing videos, but why my capcut search bar not working. When I'm trying to search it's always says ""something went wrong, try again later"". Even my phones storage is not full, update capcut, clean it's cache or restart my phone. It doesn't work plus the templates showing up are limited."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like this app it's so much fun but there is only one probably it takes very long to go in and if you wanna add a effect it takes super long and I think you should add more effects and more filters but its a very good app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why do I have to update the app every damn day with over 100MB? That's over 1G spent in 10 days. Even EA sports and other sports games don't do that.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use...Thank you so much CapCut , all of my video to my social media was made here in this App. Again Thank you so much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No point making ""space"" a.k.a cloud for storage but can't edit or download the video via phone if you edited it on CapCut Web."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App was great, until it stopped letting me put in pictures. I when to go put in a pic for a gacga green screen but it Sai could not upload. So I closed the app, and entered again after a bit. It still wouldn't work. I even tried a ai filter still wouldn't work! I won't use the app until I get notified or the problem is fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app but one thing is there's way too many pro options can u please get rid of some of the pro options and make them free? I understand u have to make money but can you pls just get rid of a few. Other than that this app is great 5 stars
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I had to drop my rating again. The app lags and glitches so much it's frustrating. I can't export any of my videos even after I cleared cache and freed up my storage (the video is 108mb)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, even if the pro is a bit annoying sometimes üòï The reason I've given it 4 stars is the fact that if I want a photo I can't always get to that particular photo. For example, I make an edit, want to pick a photo I like and it's not there. Pls fix this, otherwise an absolutely flawless appü´∂üèªüëåüèª"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app make me happy and enjoy to make video quality üòä I will give this app 100/100 I love capcut thanks to make our videos more perfect and unique üòäthank you once again ‚ù£Ô∏è
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When I downloaded this app then I think it's not helpful for editing video! Day by day I saw a new adventure this app . Now i like this app too much
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE THIS APP BUT ONLY HAVE ONE DOWN FALL TO THIS APP AND DONT KNOW IF ITS EVEN POSSIBLE, WHEN YOU APPLY VIVID COLOR TO PICTURES I WISH YOU CAN DO MULTIPLE PICTURES AT ONCE AND NOT JUST ONE AND WHEN ITS DONE THE PICTURES DONT COME OUT INTO VIDEO CLIP SEGMENTS AND STAY PHOTOS BECAUSE AGAIN ITS AWESOME BUT WITH THOSE IN EFFECT FOR WHAT I AM DOING FOR MY BUSINESS IT TAKES MANY MANY HOURS TO PERFORM LIKE 50 PICTURES"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app but why can't I put my own music on. There's no option for that, and your music sucks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very easy to edit video. And does not show any ads . It is the best app ever.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app all the time because it was very simple and easy to use. But there are too many bugs that they need to fix, for example, after I worked on an edit for 3 hours i came back to the edit saying some footages were currppted and wouldn't let do anything. PLEASE FIX THIS I worked so hard."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had capcut for a while now, and the thing that's bothered me most is the Pro. I'm sorry, but it's not good at all, as well as the effects that tend to be free of use. Yes, some are good but it makes it difficult because one of the main effects I used was switched to pro which makes me furious. It disappoints me how this app used to be free and now it's becoming economically depended on a subscription. It's a might as well quit the app til I see some improvements."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey guys, honest comment, I love your work as it has helped many editors create dope vids but I have one problem when changing speed in videos. Is there a way u can make the custom speed graph like that of keyframes(diagonal). So that when I change the speed of my videos it doesn't affect the duration. This can save me a lot. Thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,i have been using this app for been Months but after i downloaded an other app that can ya know like capcut it started to need data not like before it can use wifi and data its been a long time i have data all though i don't want to use it i want the wifi using not the data one its more usefull if its the wifi bc i can edit forever not like dataa if my data runs out no more editing Is it just me or yall to? also I've been been having fun with this app for months now its really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Recently it keeps lagging which is annoying. And you can't edit longer videos.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the app was good at first, I've used it for a long time, nothing was bad about it untill every good effect was added to pro. they know alot of people use effects like that for edits, so they add it all to pro, which is honestly really annoying. alot of the effects aren't even worth pro, only a few are, and it's making you purchase pro just for those few effects. the app was free for a long time, and adding pro was understandable, but it's overdoing it now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I literally can do whatever I want like any whatever I want make my own edits and everything you can literally use templates it's so cool to like so many cool edits
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly capcut never lets me down, it doesn't have any adds... If you don't have enough to buy pro it's not a problem capcut will still help you through your editing! The only problem is the storage space but you just need to delete some vids and it will work again"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I kept my updating it after it wasn't working on my phone. It gets to 100% and then say it can't download. Why?. I've tried it countless times. It keeps saying the same thing.. it's been going on for almost a week now and I don't know what to do. I keep wasting you data. And it was working perfectly well until it asked me to restore the app. I restored it but didn't work. I tried it on my mum's phone too it's the same thing. Why? Please reply to this review üôè.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's become more money hungry, in a way. stuff that was once free is now ""pro"", a subscription that costs REAL money. all the good things cost money now. it's become harder to edit as a small YouTuber and editor now because of the sudden change"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app to edit on and you can even use templates but it doesn't work for my nephew so I have to give it ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app will not let me make videos and when it does let me, which is very rare, it locks me out of the app and refuses to work. I spent a long time making a video and it deleted it and wouldn't let me get in the app. This app was fun at first until I realized that it doesn't work correctly which was a dissapointment..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for editing and all but it keeps saying no internet connection or unstable internet connection, it takes a lot of storage and internet plus it always suddenly crashes in the middle of editing, seriously they gotta fix those because it's a very good and useful app but I can't work with it anymore no matter what I do, I tried clearing my phone and making my internet better or using a strong vpn and all but none of them worked"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,If they can put a feature of Music syncing with a clip on the mobile version and the feature to add your own luts this would be a killer app for us Music Video Editors. I edit all my music videos using this app.üëè
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! It can help with a lot of things like ticktock and it's just fun to mess around with, but the one problem is that you have to pay for stuff that to me is ridiculous.... Like you have to have pro to use a lot of stuff sometimes but capcut allows it for free sometimes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't sign in on my account and I can't access any of the templates anymore this has been my issue ever since the update. My connection and wifi is fine.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like when you make a video you can adjust the video or pic to make it look at 4K it's like amazing when you do that, like, it's a good one, that's like the best tool üëç( even for its animations it's good to) but the pro it like the problem It doesn't let you get access to other things for velocity or something else and that not fair it like 74$ for a year like I rather get am pro ( 2.99$ for a week and 24.99 for a year üôÇ) so please make like am prices, so it isn't so expensive üò≠"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What in the world is going on with this app?? Does it have lots of templates to choose from? Yes. But that's about it. Search doesn't work. At all. And even though available in Canada, I cannot upgrade. I've tried to reach out through the feedback option and even that doesn't work. Error messages around every corner. I'm just disappointed, because I genuinely like the content, I just wish I was allowed to navigate through it to find what I need. Or at the very least, reach out for help."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The performance has has only gotten worse. I used to be able to edit huge videos with minimal issues and now it can't handle a single clip with multiple rows of text or more than 1 effect and that's AFTER deleting and redownloading the app. Idk if it's better if you pay for it bc I'm not gonna pay for features that used to be free.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Clearing the cache deleted ALL my voiceovers in ALL my projects for no reason. Frankly screw this app. I've written hundreds of emails to capcut support and sent feedback messages where I provided them with the projects as well as screenshots AND screenrecordings to show how clearing the cache makes the voiceovers gray and silent with no other opt than the delete button. Every response (if I got any) was the same bs automatic message telling me to update the app. UTTER garbage. NO communication.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Started lagging when i haven't even used it for barely a year. I had to reinstall the app to stop the lagging.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good app. If they make it better I might give them five stars You're probably asking me why you're giving them four stars because they keep on kicking me out when i'm like learning besty making video and you But I'm done doing it and I'm done watching TikTok.But I would like a hour later and go back to TikTok.They like keep going into this app and then I can't go into tiktok and I need to like her if this app is kind of confusing me
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cap cut is a pretty good app, but I don't really like that when I tried to create auto captions it just loads at 99 per cent and it's very annoying because I try to export, I tried to do it multiple times and I have tried downloading the app trying to update the app and nothing is working, please fix this capcut, I'm getting very angry and about to delete capcut forever!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is app is well with every need of Tools. But one thing is missing... Auto lyrics does not support every language (Etc.. Arabic, Russian, Swedish)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is wasting time don't download ...it didn't work well so it takes 1 hour to export a video...of 20 secs...
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"you know it actually sucks that capcut does not have a feature that allows us to see which effects are pro or not. Like you could have pud a little banner in the upper right corner, or could simply warn us where we accidentally used the pro feature one in our edits. To be honest I don't know why capcut saids I used pro cause I couldn't really locate where I went wrong."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was editing my video and typed some words and there were a random letters I didn't put. I fixed by deleting it and re-downloadüëç

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hey Capcut Community Developer, I was wondering, can you fix these probably with the title effect called ""image"", I tried the effect, and it keeps freezing when I try another face effect 10 times in the row. Can you fix this problem with these effect? Thank you. üòû‚òπÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Out of all the editing programs, I'm familiar with this one the most because I've used it so long but the update sucks. They especially put somethings that used to be free for months in Capcut Pro which I cannot use right now (cause no money :[) they put one of my favourite effects for edits in pro and that was vibration flash. And I use that a lot. That's a real d*ck move. Like that's been free for months and now you have to pay? And now Capcut won't do anything about it. Wow."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is nice, but it lags. I add some effects to the video played it. And It lags, if this is is a bug, pla fix it!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You need to fix this capcut, it keep asking me to dowload latest version and i did it but the security notice always telling me to dowload latest version"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"amazing, the effects,no ads,amazing quality! I rate a 4 for this app, however I have had a few glitches and bugs. but either way, I have experienced alot of nice thing, but I kind of wish that effects wouldn't be for payment. Hope this review helps other people."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app allows me to make or editvideos from my smartphone where I want and when I want to.it has no glitches nor does it have any ads it is by far the best video editing app I've ever had
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix the bug, I can't export because the pro features always pop when i want to export my video"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for my edits but when i updated it, it works well but the reverse was broken and i couldn't make a proper edit without reverse. when i was using effects, it was starting to get laggy and laggy it was frustrating and annoying. please fix these bugs, i really liked to use the app and it was easy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They don't have enough music and it's quite difficult to know how it works so I wouldn't really recommend it but it still works pretty well so I will give a good review on it. You can do plenty of things on it but not much to go too far with it. capcut gives good vibes, good Productions but it would need more work on their songs because they don't have enough of them... so install capcut now if you want to have good Productions but not too much music !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't pay for the Pro. It's scammy. I really liked this app, so I paid for the Pro. I paid for a whole year at once. Then, out of the blue, my account was banned and they're asking me to send them a copy of my personal documents (passport or license) to verify my age. I am NOT sending my personal documents to some random app developers. I have been back and forth with their support for days now trying to either get a refund or regain access to my account. It's been a waste of time so far."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love this app it helps me alot w all my edits but there is one problem which is that whenever I'm in the middle of an edit it randomly logs me out and this does not happen with other apps on my phone so It's something that needs to be fixed.Also the app glitches alot sometimes when I check on my projects that I already saved and then I can't find it anymore for example I saved a edit yesterday and now I can't find it anymore. I really hope you fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used capcut for years, specifically for edits, but they are constantly adding more ""pro"" options, they've recently added one of the most basic animations to pro, it's laggy and delets my edits if it glitches to much or if I add ""to many effects"" I feel the reason why it's laggy is because of it being very big on tik tok, and just to add, cap cut was COMPLETELY free wayy before it joined tiktok"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not working when we add a simple internal storage audio, really very sad about that app function"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"do they even want people to use their app? this app is for editing, no? so how come they made the fade in text feature pro then just completely gotten rid of it all together? also, how come my slow mo now longer works? every time i go to use it, the app either crashes and takes me back to the home page or comes out fully. it gets the two stars tho because of quality."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be an okay app for editing. Recently it's been really laggy, and crashing. Now there are ads? You kidding me? Downloaded this because it was free and easy to use like 3 years ago. And now that my edits are starting to look half decent, I can't even do that without the app crashing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app helps you make videos for anyone or anything but the only down side is it give you a lot of notifications
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like this editing app BUT THERES A PROBLEM. EVERYTIME I USE THE CHROMA KEY BACKGROUND REMOVER IT DOESNT DETECT THE CORRECT COLOR! Especially the custom background remover. IT DOESNT EVEN WORK WELL. pls fix this :<

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you open the app, it says the security notice which stops you from getting the app, i downloaded it from the real playstore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use this app sm this is the only editing app i've got. And to be honest, the best and easiest editing app i've ever downloaded! But the issue is when I edit, it lags in the middle of editing. Please fix it, because it disturbs me from getting a good timing on-beat. Thank you :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Really easy to edit but when you get ready to export it that's when everything happens every time I tried to export it it crashed so I waited till the next day just to deal with it I wake up and every time I go into the app I can only be in it for about 1 minute before it crashes I deleted the app and signed back into my account once I read downloaded it all of my projects were gone
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why when edit the video and you put on smooth slow motion it's still laggy after you used it, it's not like that when i first download the capcut. What did happened? Is it my phone or the app? I can't tell because this is the exact phone when i use the smooth slow motion and it is a job well done, but now? It's not. It's lagging."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Has made my posting work life easier! So many functions. Love that it always saves my work even if I don't remember to.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,officialy unistalling this app been loveing it for ages using it to add subtitles to videos but as usual aa predifted like most apps get a little popularly and greed kicks lets get tons of money from users now they have been blocking more features to force people to get a premium account like adding more caps to the pro list i will look for something eles
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Been using the app with no problems. Been able to upload all my projects... Finally upgraded to the pro and guess what?? Can't upload anything anymore... Why pay for more features when I can't even upload my projects...

This was a problem for me since I couldn't edit my work the way I wanted to or just do edits in general..plus the prices for pro are ridiculous! Lots of people used capcut cuz it's a free app that had a lot of free things but it's started to get expensive. I don't like the fact that they put fan favorites into pro. This update wasn't helpful at all, it was dumb and ridiculous."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After using this after a while or a long time, the video you put in will stop moving depending where you stopped before. Also, PRO?? What's the point? It's ruining the app especially as they make more things into PRO, people can't make good edits if most of the effects are PRO. But it's a good editing app, it just had been ruined because of PRO."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app But has some issues the most problematic for me is uploading photos, I need to click on each circle it's taking a lot of time If I could just highlight everything or click on the photo itself to highlight it, I would spend less time please change that function it was better Other problem is glitching out it's like capcut can't take more that 85 photosü•≤"

Otherwise it's good but when you try to put an audio on. You search it up but you can't find it anywhere! Also you have to make a 1 minute video for copyrighted music? No way!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Over all it's a great app really! But I really don't get what's going on. The app is updated and everything but like two third of ALL my photos are not loading so I can't even use capcut. Capcut tell me what is going on. Edit: my pictures and videos are still not loading I have the latest version and everything

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't use this one much, but it is excellent for use on tiktok and such of you're into that sort of thing. I do upload quite a bit to tiktok, I just don't use templates often enough to make this download worth while. Still an excellent app though!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app used to be so cool until they started to make all the good effects ""pro"", lots of lags when you import a clip or multiple clips, especially when i make my own velocity. this kinda ruins the experience of the app, please fix the lags immediately."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been editing on this for a while now I really love this app but the pro feature has the effects and stuff that are more trendy and more needed and therefore the good ones so to make them I have to edit more than actually using pro features,just hoping that they'll be better features without pros and that capcut works on that and now just trying to make money out of it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's got a lot to it but a 50 percent of the app is paid. I even paid for pro assuming it'd fix my lag and it didn't. Edits come out off beat, enhancers make the video quality worse. Tonssss of lag. The app is useless with the lag honestly. Trying to get a refund now but they said I have to talk to my bank?? Also no my phone is not old, it's a year old. And I have good wifi. Shouldn't be lagging!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love this app and its video editing......its a lovely app but the reason i gave it 4 stars is because when i want to make my on project i can't find audio even if i search for a song i won't find it Or it gives a different song and it also doesn't have templates when making ur own project i'd really like it if this was fixed please.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is Good for editing, but I gotta tell you, y'know? Most of the Features are literally pro, example: Shake, shake is now pro? But wasn't it Not pro? So ig they changed it to pro. But there's no new Smooth Graphs? Almost everything is like, pro. And also, when I export a 1 - 2 minutes video, it literally crashes?? There are many bugs in capcut. Could you please capcut, Fix those bugs? I'll just give it a 3 rate star. I don't have anything to write here, so, Yea, that's all I wanna write."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can never log in to use the branded music option. Its always giving me issues and I can never edit whenever I want too. Its doesnt seem to matter what platform i use to log in to. It always says ""maximum numbers of attempts reached.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Definitely deserve love... They should advertise that this app absolutely helps with views even though they don't claim that.. gets five starts. Only one thing I'd fix is letting you size pictures, not necessarily cropping but sizing to fit the frame properly.. It you use other apps and take time, you can get them to fit .. I figured instead of leaving the app to use a different one..add that feature..love the app deserves the 5 star rating...."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please remove pro, and make everything free. Overal its good. I used to edit with this program in 2021. Before there was pro. I like the new effects. But again. For the good ones you have to pay. Its a good app to start editing with. But as you grow out of it i recommend Adobe Editor."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The reason I made it into 3 stars is that you made all good effects into pro which makes it not ""free"" anymore. True it's a free and eazier app but the fact that you made all good effects pro is not helping. I mean yea I guess you do need money. The second star is that you need more effects, and you need to add effects in the texts. Your effects are good but it's still lacking."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Real good after playing around with the settings it becomes very fun also has alot of help how to use it's so cool I'm having so much fun using templates and making my own. I recomend it especially if you want to be creator it's a good step to see if your capable.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Biggest drawback is Capcut doesn't establish a folder via Google photos. Like I literally cannot find the videos I make through Capcut on my phone, whereas every other video maker creates a folder on your phone. I have a Samsung galaxy Fold phone. Capcut, can you make your app discoverable?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much. I edit on it a lot but i am really mad that on the newest update you cannot adjust effects anymore. You cant, it doesnt work and i dont understand, you need capcut premium for that too or what? And at certain clips you cannot add keyframes and adjust the opacity. Why."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app was good for ages, but now it just keeps glitching and it kicks me off from editing, and it wont let me export. when i export, it just kicks me off at 79% and sometimes 81%. please fix this bug because its really annoying"

It is now expensive, when u need a effect, u need to pay money! This sucks. Old capcut better, thats why now i moved to alight motion and now i can make alot of cool/slay edits with alight motion bc IT DOESNT LAG and its perferct for my phone.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So this app use to be one of my fav but it just has went down hill so much im a guy that likes to make fan films for yt and uf my video is longer then 10 min it gets laggy and sometimes wont add the video to my gallery so there might just be better editing apps out there but for shorter videos this app can be ok just bring back the old cap cut
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I give this a perfect 5 star because of those features that I can easily use with out asking for payment. There were premium features that you can choose but you have to pay but still there were more features which is for free and you can use.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Every time I try to make an edit and I try to add the audio it kicks me out to the home page and it's very annoying I can't edit at all cause no matter what I do It kicks me out to the home page when I try to add an audio or off a video template I don't know if it's just my phone but it's frustrating
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I only gave it four stars cuz I cant give it four and a half. One minor problem, theres too many capcut pro effects, so smaller users who dont have or are unable to get CapCut pro are bombarded with stuff they cant use. If you could just give us some accesebility to the other stuff that would be great."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app for editing videos, but the problem is if you want to make your videos extremely good, you have to get cap cut Pro. It's annoying how they made smart sharpen on cap cut pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm disappointed CapCut, before everything was so cool this was the first editing app I used. It was also so easy to understand everything but now it says No Internet Connection everytime when open the app even when I'm so close to Internet. If you would fix this problem then I'll really be glad. Thank You."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,As someone who edits daily I find it really hard to see how my videos will look at the end after adding effects etc because it lags. If you could fix the lagging issue it would make using the app 10 times easier!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the updates from the past year are so overrated, and i cant even transfer my project into my phone because its 1gb+ and wont be placed in my space, and i need to subscribe just to get storage, but i wont. i tried removing some clips and after that, i had to restart from the top. worst app!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, been using for years. Premium kinda ruined it, but sure you gotta make money somehow. Also, the linking a tiktok account is kinda iffy, like if its already linked to one capcut account it can't be linked to another. It's caused quite a few issues for me"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"gets way to laggy if you add more than 100 pictures for a video,so much that it crashes they ruined the app so I can't even make a video anymore if it takes more than 100mb, just wasted 4 and a half hours of my damn life and can't even save the video to my phone anymore BRING BACK THE OLD CAPCUT FROM 4 YEARS AGO"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App worked one time. Tried to download the video again and it says I've used pro features. No pro features on my video. Nothing changed from the first download. Don't trust having video projects trapped on they're platform forced to pay to download them.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wow! Your product is really excellent but you keep making more and more of the filters and effects for pro users. Soon there would be nothing left for us to use. Your app ain't cheap. It cost an arm and a leg. But that's the only thing that worries me. Sincerely yours, CapCut creator."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, since it's a lot easier to edit but what bothers me is that how we now have to pay for certain things to use which I understand, what I don't understand is why they would leave one of the effects I always use which is ""vibration flash"" and it was always free, and then suddenly another update comes around and I can't use it anymore, I don't know why they changed it but I can guess that it was because people used it a lot and they thought putting it on pro was a good idea."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This game is honestly really great! The tools are super great and I love how there are tutorials to show you how to use the tools properly.

One thing that I hate about this app, is when you use it for too long (a year or a few months) It starts getting all glitchy. Like when I pause the video and scroll back to another scene, the whole screen just stops, like it freezes. I can still hear the sound but the screen is completely frozen. It's honestly just so annoying because now I have to delete it then re-download it. But otherwise, I recommend! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Cap Cut is quite good as on tiktok you can get free templates which help beginner's, There's alot of good effects and I've seen such good results in videos. There's one bad thing tho, most things have become pro which you have to pay for and so that's why it's not a 5. Other than that capcut is quite good and I really recommend it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Glitches sometimes but overall pretty good Edit: You can't do anything near complex without it lagging or taking forever. I tried to reverse a 0.6 second video and it took me 15 minutes for it to finally complete, then it'll just randomly crash. Updating didn't even help. This app just keeps going downhill after every update."

You don't need to learn it, you just need to practice for maybe a few days, I Have been using this for 5 months and there only were a few glitches! It's really helpful for me to upload."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good when the application actually works, otherwise Plain trash. CapCut Is really laggy on devices that are not a computer. It keeps crashing 24/7. Also, it keeps telling me to 'Dowloand the new version' even if I already did so."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now, I can't do any automatic subtitles without being pro. The app automatically puts to identity filler words, and I can't take that out."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This has the most features of any mobile video editor I've tried; its seriously impressive. Unfortunately, the app is let down by its instablility. Bugs range from minor annoyances (timeline occasionally jumping forward) to outright deal-breakers that make it nearly impossible to edit (out of sync audio, timeline skipping first 1-2s). I tried to give it a chance, but in all of my time using the app, no major issues have ever been addressed, and new glitches keep popping up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app. Everything about this app is too local. Nothing professional. Some of your features doesn't work ! I tried editing two videos together, but the result is very very poor After removing the background, the image looks like a masquerade"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Loading effects for 3 hours. Spent a good twenty minutes putting the perfect 16 photos together. I figured it would take a bit to load but 3 hours later and it's still at 0% so I'm going to say the app is broken. (I even reset the app a couple times and tried again)

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is the worst experience I had with this app. every time I edit a video a green screen pops up for the entire video even if I delete the video and add it back the same green screen issue keep occurring. You guys need to fix your app its getting Horrible every update. This is such a horrible experience for me as an editorüò°üò§üò§üò†
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Okay. 2023 good 5 stars. Until the pro premium came! Animations needs to be paid. And it's just like something you can find in the ortenet for free. LIKE THIS JR EDITORS. I better go to adobe premium pro or after effects This is not a real editing app to spend money on
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,For now I still rate Capcut one of the best. It works on Android and IOS perfectly it's just some little bugs. But you guys should try and fix that. So you can remain my favorite forever üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The application does not work and it shows me that there is no internet available, knowing that my internet is strong, and it does not open templates from the Tik Tok application. What is the solution?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a good app for sure, but it lags if there can make it so that it doesn't lag it would be really nice and very beginner friendly it's just the lag"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good, people can edit easily, this app has no problems like other apps. I paid less because it takes a lot of MB to upscale the video quality but the app is very good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Violent lag with every clip. Delayed. You gotta pay for almost everything. Old capcut was better because you don't need to pay for the entire app just to use it. New one? @ss.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's very satisfying but i have not really gone deep into it. I feel like they actually made this app mainly for content creators which is very annoying to actually know.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for years and it helps me alot other people complain about bugs but when you're using the app correctly you wouldn't experience bugs but that's my opinion.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Capcut was perfectly fine with being $8 a month. I am not paying $14 a month on something I can do better on Alight Motion which charges $5 a month.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know about mobile version, but PC version had very low effects, and useless. Used shake effect, and it was terrible."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is actually one of the best editing app, I have had on phone so far, but one thing I don't like the fact that some the capcut refuses to edit, it always request an udate"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have never faced an issue really except for the fact that today, when I opened my phone, there was a cloud on it, I clicked it and it said to reset, so I did and now it isn't happening. Please fix this issue"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible support experience. Pro subscription kept requiring age verification. Age verification broken and instructions in Chinese. Support was not helpful. Requested refund. Took 1 1/2 months to get refund. Beware.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's good if you need to edit content or if your don't have any ideas there's a lot of videos that you can just export and make your own. 5 star very helpful
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I edited a video, and I can't export it. It appears to be loading then the loading icon vanished and still nothing changes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fine with everything. Premium features, transitions, animations, etc. Are understandable for being premium."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app was the best app ever for editing but now with. Capcut pro is alot worse your edit will lag if you won't put capcut pro your edits will be dry i now will use alight motion and other that are üíØ%free I take it back capcut alot better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This doesn't work in India and it is the reason we have to use VPN. If the VPN stops working for some reason it shows offline and we are not able to do anything.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Shake transition,the Comparision transition and some other features suddenly turned into Pro fetures a few months ago.Please make things right again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good. I think that they should add more edits and effects for no pro. Because it makes it so that my videos aren't as good, but it's still very good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is cool but not very user friendly for people who aren't tech savvy. It's a little confusing and isn't really clear on how to do the filters.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is good for editing. However, when I try to add some music, it's lagging and it takes me back to the project. So it's a bit irritating. But I like this app :)"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"honestly.... this app is kind of okay, tho I can't give it full 5 stars because there are some features I would add. NOT MAKING IT ""PRO"" FEATURES AGAIN. First of all I would add less laggy background removal, then there's one feature, for example in ibis paint there's a feature where when you want to rotate the overlay, you have a button that allows you to do it without needing 2 fingers, or making it bigger. I, as an animator/editor use this app quite often, but those are features I'd add/fix."

You don't need to pay anything, but it would ruin your video, make it look bad, but if you pay, you can get the things that you actually need to have good edits! Woo. Also, with a new feature on tiktok, you can get templates off capcut and post them on there, but now it's telling me I have 6 free uses of AI then the rest I need to pay for? I'm not even posting it! Why do I need to pay for somethint I'm not using!"

If you search anything up like cinema the effect wouldn't show up which is really confused, Also I don't really like how they added pro cause it seems like they are starting to become the rest of the other editing apps. Hopefully capcut stays free, but I still recommend the app to beginners."

The second thing that bothers me is the Exportation. The Exportation, usually takes almost about an hour to just create & upload a video or short to any social platforms.

So please add other ways to save the video."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a very good app .I am happy with video editing with this app . I have been using this app for years Haven't found any errors so far .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Some of the things don't want work for me. The things that would work if don't have WiFi or Data won't work for me even when I have WiFi or data.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix the stupid ""security notice"" the app is already up to date, im already logged in and i still cant use the app at all because of that."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like this app but it's super glitchy when I adding a sound it's automatically switch to templates
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its great for me. I was about to give this app in 5 stars but i ended up with giving 3 stars. I thought this app was good and easy to use but theres some problems that i hate. 1) The video that i edit on this app crashes. Really bad and i was dissapointed because i spend too much hours on that vid. 2) I wanted to add the song i wanted but it ended up adding nothing. I thought it was a glitch and i updated it and it still the same. fix it please i have more things to complain but i cant.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible if you want to make edits with videos, multiple graphs, and transitions. It doesn't let you play back your video unless you wait a few seconds for the app to CATCH UP with you. I shouldn't have to wait if I'm just uploading a few clips."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear Bytedance, This app is an awesome app for editing i used for an entire year for making videos to upload to YouTube, but you ruined it. Now, i cant do a single edit unless i use a template, because if not it will force me to upload to Tiktok, but i hate Tiktok. Please remove the ""save and share to tiktok"" feature. Sincerely, THEminicat."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It have so many problems on capcut Ex.: I can't save my edit, I can't search template I want! What's going on capcut!?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,CapCut is a very good editing app but I don't know why it lags when using it's animations and other features
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but now it's.. yuck. Everything, down to the effects, stickers... even FONTS are now behind pay walls for Pro! That effect you love to use? PRO. The font you love to use? PRO. Any actually good sticker? PRO. Voice changer? PRO. Want a filter? Too bad! PRO. It's annoying! I used to love CapCut, for all its features, options, and video-editing softwares for my YouTube, but now I can't do ANYTHING! And paying for Pro does nothing either! Greedy, fishing for money!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's honestly a wonderful app, it's my main editing app since it's so simple, but lately it's been glitching out. Whenever I try to edit add audio it glitches out and closes the app. Then when I open it up it says the footage has been corrupted. I haven't been able to edit for a week."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sir, Please add the feature of watching ads to unlock pro features for some time..... Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee even it's 10 ads for a single premium feature üò≠"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very impressed. I used this to make a music video for a sendoff at work and everyone really loved the graphics. Great product. Update 04/14/2024 This used to be very easy to use and was loaded with lots of features but now because of the premium upgrade, the basic version has become difficult and confusing to use. It's very slow on my Chromebook."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is really cool! üî• The templates make it even better but my issue with this app is with my photos üì∏ When I look through the templates and start finding photos, I have only resent photos that I've taken. Please fix this it would help a lot and also for me to update this comment üí¨ Thank you üôèüåπ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app for editing but my problem is that after I export a sound from a video and go back after I export it,it will kick me out of the app...I tried many times doing it again but still kick me out I even restarted my phone but still no changes.Is it my phone or the app??"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love using this all but everytime I just open my edit and play the video, it just becomes very laggy. I love how it is very easy to use app and has very cool features such as the AI tools. This is my go to app for editing! New: STOP CHANGING FREE THINGS TO PRO!!! My go to transition is the comparison and now that is pro!! Change it back! Also, Capcut is telling me the current version of this app is not secure and to download the newest version. I already did and it's still telling me!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really good, I've been using it for four years now, and it couldn't get any better. There's just one issue. When I use the drawing tool, it instantly defaults to premium brush. Leading to putting the ""Premium Features"" button on the top right, and trying to erase it being tough. You can just delete it, but it still won't go away. Love the app though, use it almost daily!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is truly amazing but the thing is I would love to make edits if it wasn't for capcut pro but other than its amazing!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but there are some bugs like if video is long it always compress the video and then the voice of the video desync, we have to extract the audio then! And another thing in the new update that you changed the very important tool in voice (vocal only, etc) which was good tool so now we have to move to anothet app for that!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The kids who go on and say ""Oh, what. terrible app! :/"" Its ridiculous. Capcut is extremely helpful. There a free templates. I would recommend getting caput Pro, as they have the best effects. After effects and capcut I recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is super nice it helps me because i can post cool edits and trendingss because of this app. I can post in any social med because of this app i like the edits here there are so many talented people here. thats all i will rate it 4 üíñ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pay for pro and all of a sudden i cant even use the app anymore!? Will be cancelling pro obviously as paying for a service i cannot use. The videos i load into the app to edit glitch and go black i can hear audio but no video, i cant edit it in any way. Followed all the steps cache, data uninstalled and reinstalled lost ALL my edited vids i had saved. And never even made a diffrence. What is going on? Reported a fault but zero communication?! Was so happy with the app but now i cant recommend"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"i have been working with this app for so long, its good but somehow when i tried it on my new phone (infinix) the smooth slow mo does not work. it says the effects is applied but the slo mo is still choppy. idk if its my phone or its on the app but it is really sad that the smooth slo mo is not working properly :((( pls fix itt"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am pretty disappointed in this apps inability to use almost every single audio file I try to add, even though they are the correct format. Pretty much makes it worthless for my purposes. Canceling my subscription and looking for a better app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, capcut was good at first but ever since it added premium many effects, animations, etc, have been unusable without having to pay for it, it wasn't all that bad when it was new effects but now it's taking over a bunch of effects that used to be free, it's just a matter of time before capcut isn't usable for free."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is app is amazing... When it works. Most of the time whenever I'm editing the video will freeze and lag. The editing features are cool and all but what is the point of that if the software itself doesn't work.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It glitches out on me untill the point i had to delete it but it's it's good app and it's fun- ig but for the most part it's good for anything and best by far to me, I haven't found a app better than this, yes it will lag but I haven't had a big problem with it its rlly nice and when u export it its very clean. So until then I think it's the best app for animations and stuff."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a very good video editing app with lots of editing options. It doesn't have a watermark. Though the reason why I am giving it a 3 stars is because it crashes everytime I export the video. Please fix this bug
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've never had any issues with capcut for the past 3 years until now, it always lag when I put an overlay, please fix this and i can't use any template, effects, transitions, or filters because it says network unstable even though my net is perfectly fine. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good editing app just there's a few things I dislike. First off, there never used to be pro and now almost EVERYTHING is pro, so you now have to get pro for literally EVERYTHING. Second, sometimes when I export my projects, they don't show up and I got to export them twice or more. Honestly this capcut pro stuff should stop. It was a way better app when you could use things. I also hate the fact that the free thinga you used to be able to use got turned into pro, please take this away, its bad."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was okay at first, but when it had pro features, if I ACCIDENTALLY press on a pro feauture I'd replace it with a non-pro one. But when I export it it'll say ""You're using Pro Feautures"" even though I'm CLEARLY not. This is annoying and I just lost all of my progress with the edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I'm about to adjust the clip It always stops or freezes, and when I cut the clip, it doesn't apply to the video. It's so frustrating because the video is for my school project, but the app doesn't work properly. Please kindly fix these bugs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's wrong,anytime I tried to use a template on tictok,and it gets to capture where I'm supposed to select photo or video,when I'm done with my selection,if I tap on preview it'll show""couldn't download"",and really sure it's not the network."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your app is a Trash. I properly check my project in your application and it run smoothly; but, when i export it, the masking has Peekaboo glitch like bruuu you just reveal the identity of the privacy of person. For the second time,i check it again on my project but,it run smoothly and no problem.So, i export it again for the second time but, THERE'S A GLITCH AND THE SAME PROBLEM!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It would be 5 stars but I just went in pressed add a new project click the video I wanted to edit in and before I could start editing it just sent me to templates and it did that a few more times then I fully closed all the apps open then went back into caput and it did it again Usly(idk if that's spelled right but it's use ly and it's the word that mean most of the time)it's good so uhm it might be my phone but uhm if u experience this it's deff not just my phone
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app ,I've been using it from the time it was released ,how I'm having a problem with the animation combo being mixed up, on my device. I'm not to sure it's only happened on my device, but it is really difficult to edit with this ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I found capcut at first, so amazing. So I decided to pay for a month. But to my surprise, some of the templates, specifically the title, don't work. This is frustrating. I don't know if I'm gonna renew or no more. Fix this, please. I pay for pro to use those features, but it always says ""can't use this template. hayst!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This sure is a good editing app, but my problems are that there is too many premium stuff. Second whenever I try to move my texts it resizes instead. And third when I use extracted music and start to put effects, the video will be slow and the music ends first."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, I would make edits all the time, but ever since CapCut Pro happened, a lot of the features that I would use daily, got moved to Pro eventually. Honestly, I do not think I will use CapCut anymore. I don't know who thought that it would be a good idea to move a lot of the features to Pro but that was a huge mistake and I will not be buying Pro. Honestly, I do not want to spend my money on an app that doesn't care for its non Pro users."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is an amazing video editing app! It offers a variety of cool features such as transitions, effects, filters, and music options. The editing process is user-friendly, allowing you to easily customize your videos. CapCut takes your videos to a professional level."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Make this app free again and maybe you'll get a better review. I get when you make things specifically for pro, but now you keep making all kinds of things (filters, effects, etc.) that use to be free into pro. It's not only extremely frustrating, but also is driving away all of your users."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible. Can't export anything as it just freezes and send me back to edit screen. Tried uploading to my space and downloading but it's nowhere to be found on my phone. Tried all suggestions on Google and nothing helped. Uninstalling and finding something else to create a 2023 recap video.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Always use this app since the start, used to be really obsessed with this app, it's free and really easy to use than any other apps. But since the update. Some effects are no longer free like it used to be. I used to use some more effects but now it's no longer free anymore. I rarely use this app now days, and I only use it for simple school projects sometimes. The capcut Pro is quite expensive in my country too. To me, I'd rather use mods rather than buying the 'Pro' version instead."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is such a great app for editing videos, Although there are many reoccurring problems with the app for me. Everytime I add a text and delete some of the letters, it stays in the screen which Is quite frustrating and I have to close capcut again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been reliable up until now, it doesn't scan for audio files anymore. No, I haven't changed my things to mp4 just to scan them in (because I shouldn't need to!) The system worked perfectly fine before and now it simply doesn't scan for any files."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It doesn't have regular Rob Zombie music or regular Little John music or even it doesn't even have Elsa Mafia regular music sorry I messed up but still I am going to give it a two-star
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this, but it's been SUPER BUGGY lately. Sound disappears suddenly from my videos, and when I scrub back to edit something it fast-forwards the video when I hit play. EXTREMELY annoying and I thought it was just an update away, but no. Get better. No please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good video editing app for animators like me. But I give it a 3.5 stars because of the weird and sometimes annoying glitches other than that it's good. Another thing is if your capcut is over 4 minutes it starts to lag bad. Need optimization.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I use to love this app had it for a while I had to download it again and it seem to be a updated version I hate it !! It glitches constantly and then crashes none of the filters has good quality and too much pro stuff I would never buy! Looking for something better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, amazing for editing videos and using templates - the only thing is that it takes up a lot of space on your phone and when you download the videos you have created, they take up most of your storage space. Apart from that, it is a great app and really useful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's probably one of the best video creating apps I've ever had. One thing, though: I can't install TikTok, and I would like to use ""popular"" songs. However, when I search for them, it doesn't come up. I don't know if the songs are from TikTok only, but still. Love the app, though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app was a good editing app for a lil moment before all the recent updates and everything! I've had this app for 2.5 years at most and JUST RECENTLY!..It's been glitching + freezing + overlaping! And I LITERALLY had to GIVE UP editing because the ONE APP I USE doesn't work anymore! I've tried to delete apps to see if that helps but no way!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't believe they made the Fade In option for text animation a Pro option only now! I don't get this. If it was a free option initially, it should stay a free option! You can make other animation and make that Pro only, keep the original free ones free. That's just cheating us users."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for editing and also it has many template options but I think it is incomplete. I mean I don't know why, but it looks like something is absent. Anyhow, this is the best editing and tamplate app ever. I must recommand this application to everyone. It's a great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Annoying and very long Ads before exporting the vedio. Please remove ads before exporting. I like this app as an editor but if you don't fix it absolutely with in a weak me and my friends will uninstall this app At the end I requested you to plz fix it. Next time absolutey I will give this app 5 stars rating and also best review, only when you fix this problem (remove ads) THANKS!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What have you done? ‚òπÔ∏è I can't export any videos now because it freezes on the export screen. It will get to a certain percentage and just... stop. It worked once after the recent update and now it's broken again. Been like this for a week.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, and I've been using it for years, but the pro is really making it harder to edit. Basic effects like fps lag and even the smart sharpen are going to pro, which sucks a lot. Capcut has lots of potential it's just having to pay for things that's really limited the app I think."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app it makes it easier to work there might be some things that bother other people but for me it is just the perfect app some apps dont have overlays but this has and I am just very satisfied with this app if u are a beginner you should try this app it is very easy to use U can add effects and texts and transitions and overlays and much more but somehow while rendering the quaility goes really bad and i would love if it gets better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My review used to be 5 stars, but ever since they added this pro thing, the app just feels so p2w. At first it was fine for me, cause they just added new great features that was only accessible using the paid version. But it really started to bother me when they decided to change some of the free effects, and options to be pro.. But overall its not that bad of an app for editing, especially for newbies. Just that pro feature thats annoying me alot"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Cap cut is an amazing editing app it's really good but it's not anymore it's the only editing app that I actually know how to use but the templates have ruined everything now everything revolves around the templates everywhere I go it's the only thing I can find there are no more original edits not to mention people are stealing other edits from people and posting them on the cap cut templates people are claiming that's their own edit we need to put an end to these the ruining everything.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's crashing way too much like every few minutes. I'm currently using other editing app to do most of the work. I just used capcut for auto caption. But even after that it can't even export stuff properly. I exported and upload the video only to find out it wasn't exported even tho it said it was exported. Old capcut was better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's difficult to change the speed using the curve material on mobile because they are so small and cannot be close to each other. The texts I put in some parts of the video somehow shifts randomly because of the curved speed mechanic. Please fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I always loved this app the interface,the effects etc it's just so simple and I'm the beginning it used to work just fine on my device but now!? After completing am edit it doesn't allow me to play in during editing and idk how my edit looks like everytime to check how my edit is I have to export it and do changings according to that"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad app ...it started showing black and white switches on my video ...so i redownload the app but it became much worse it changes the colour of my video right after am done saving it,the app atomatically restarts each time i try to use text background,makes my videos look dirty...Am gonna download a new editing app if my complain isnt taken"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"they make every single effect pro and it's honestly annoying, if you need money put some ads online or something, don't make every effect paid for. They were probably making more money before the pro version when everything was free, so go back to that because no one is paying for a glow effect or something silly like that"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app...it's fun...you can be creative....you can share what you create with other social networks, an individual, save it for yourself, reuse it and recreate it on other apps or you can reuse and or recreate it on CapCut...it's also inspired me to be more creative with my photos and videos... CapCut allows me to be me...they give you tips for making your project better...they give you gifts...they have contest...and they offer thousands of templates you can use..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,its good... it was really good... but nowadays it keeps glitching so much that the work i'm doing becomes annoying. i enjoyed the app so much. nowadays for the bug it needs so much time to make an edit cause the app keeps glitching... please fix this bug asap.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,the problem now I have with the app is the overlay yesterday I was adding overlay very well but yesterday suddenly when I tried adding over lay it brings me back to menu I tried restarting my phone and Uninstalled the app but the overlay bug effect is still here I keep trying to add overlays but IT JUST KEEPS BRINGING ME BACK TO THE MENU. people really need to fix the bugs on this app more often.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app, it's a great app to edit my videos. Make decent thumbnails. The only problem ISIS the freaking VIP cost. It just costs you too much. If you could just lower that a little bit, I'll be really happy but other than that, a great app in a highly recommend"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,If I wanna do a trending edit that someone posted. It always slow and the sounds never match up with the pics. It's good but I wish they would fix that issue. It happend with my old phone too so I don't think it's my phone issue.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently, I was editing a vid and wanted to export a sound from my gallery. But I couldn't find the video to export sound. I had to download that video multiple times to find it but no luck. I had to reinstall this app. Pls fix this issue. Thanks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For some reason, I can't even use the app normally anymore. It doesn't load anything and just continues to crash, making me lose every videos that I am editing, including my school projects. The only reason I gave it a two instead of one was because it wasn't like this before."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is okay, and I love it, I really do, but there were some problems where it tends to get glitchy A lot When I play the video to view, it skips and then plays And when it gets to one of the things I edited on overlay, it freezes and then skips everything"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was very good, useful and good for EDITS but now ever since I've updated it the slow motion is horrendous (so is the motion blur). Like the video delays it ISNT smooth and idk what has happened!! I seriously need them to update it so it's smooth for the people who DONT want to pay."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am talking to you and I live in South Asia. Friend your app is very good. I like it very much. We can easily make more videos with beautiful quality with your app. The annoying thing about this is the problem. It says there is no internet connection. When going to use it. I have checked several times to see if there is any such problem, but there is no such problem in the phone. This happens again and again. Can you solve it soon?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I edit a video example if I export a photo or video in a edit, it crashes. And it is so disappointed for me because i don't know how could i say that if I export some photos or videos It crashes!!! Even though the storage and others are all fine!! FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is terrible and unuseable. I remember when capcut had some ok features, and you had to make videos from that. Now they made a ""PRO version"" where you have to pay 8eur or so each month to be able to use better effects. I get this, and i think it's great. BUT THEN, THEY PUT IN OLD EFFECTS THAT WERE ALWAYS FREE TO PRO!!!! This was the last straw. They don't make new good effects, but make the mediocre free ones cost 8eur now??? It's sad to see how low this company will go. I hope they fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't even use Capcut anymore. When I wasn't editing for a long time and wanted to edit again when I tried to make a edit when i put the video it would be ok but when I put a another video it puts me back to the home of capcut and I can only edit on a different phone. Honestly I rate it 1 star.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The preview is very laggy, and when I try to export the video, it stops in the middle. This app used to be perfect, but now it isn't. Plus, all the good effects are pro."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, I'm a professional video/movie editor and this works perfectly fine for being a mobile editor. If you're looking for something similar to Snapchat just get Snapchat, this app is more like a free version on filmora mobile. Many people complained about the filters, and here's my advice, just don't use them. Using real lighting is always way better looking."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible. App does not even prompt you to choose an account so I always end up logging in to the wrong one. Absolutely frustrating! I've been at this for many hours and it just does the same thing. Not only that, for the love of god please remove the Tik-Tok sign in when trying to add another account! It's useless in situations where someone else is having this issue!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good for editing but there a really annoying bug where if an overlay is less than 0.5, the anumations will be automatically set to 5s, hence we cannot scroll it, it will also break the scale, specially when i want to add animation both at starting and ending. Please fix it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, lots to choose from - all you need is ideas and let capcut do the rest!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I ALWAYS USED THIS APP BUT NOW ITS BECOME TERRIBLE!!! Everything that used to be normal such as smart sharpen, hexagonal blur, halo blur and etc, has become part of capcut pro! Until they bring it back to normal I recommend alight motion or even blurr because this app was known for being so good mainly because of the fact it was completely free."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since yall started to put the new updates there it's all ruined and there are lot of bugs you can't even Fix by closing and opening the app + the stupid new pro thing it has to be EVERYWHERE and it's really getting on nerves most of the time when you're trying to find one effect. Lost all my motivation for editing becouse of this so 1 star.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using this last year, I've had recent issues with it, when I adjust my text, it just randomly disappears, same thing when I put it near on the split area, this includes media and sound, I've installed and uninstalled the app many times, it still doesn't fox the issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app but I would like to ask if the service or the team can create an easier way to find templates on the app so it can be easier for those who don't what tiktok. I love the app as it's great at editing and is extremely promising.l hope the team takes in my request. Thank you
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They need to fix the text immediately most of the time when I'm writing a text it's does this glitch we're it does something like this eg.laglag-when I try to delete the text it just says eg. laglag please fix it or I won't use the app Other than this it's fine until you fix this I have to use another editing software as this really stresses me out and waste time I might use after affects or another editing software until you fix this fix please imma check everyday to see if you update it thanks
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, onec you know how to use it you can't stop however I hate how now literally every good filter/effect is pro and it gets to a point if you add to much filters the quality looks squarish if that makes any sense. I have to use different apps for colourings because if that. But other then that I really do enjoy editing on this app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. The people on it are nice, but I have some complaints. I have an account where I post, and some stuff that I spend HOURS on goes under review and next thing I know, months later I'm scrolling through my post and the video is STILL under review. Second. The pro features. So much stuff is pro. I'm speechless. Third. Copywrited audios. I know, they check for it before you post, but sometimes they delete the audio after I post the template. It also lags, making it hard to edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Using this app has been a positive experience overall, but I'm unable to access my cloud photos from Google Photos. Since all my photos and videos are stored there rather than on my phone, it would greatly enhance the app's functionality if this feature were added."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I rate 5 stars because it has a video background remover for FREE, which is rare for a free version of an editing app. It also has a diverse selection of cool transitions, perfect for editing tiktoks, music videos, vlogs, and school projects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the easiest to use for me and the best all the features are amazing just a few things than I would give it 5 stars: 1.Better stickers 2.an effect that just shakes the thing a little bit and slowly 3.more voice effects ESPECIALLY the triggered meme voice changer PLEASEüò≠üôè 4.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add this one and the 3rd one, to be able to name your exported sounds Other that that this is AMAZING üëå"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy this and have for a long tine. I don't like getting trapped or tricked into buying sets of photos or getting sent to membership pay page everytime I finish working on certain photos. Cap Cut is fun and easy!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is ok and i wold of given it 5 stars but when i scroll for too long the app crashes and it wont let me find the template that i was looking at wich is really frustrating, also when i try to edit a template made by someone else using the 'more edit' button the app crashes after loading for about 1 minute loading wich means i cant use the template the way i want to PLS FIX THIS!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am having issues adjusting in and out animations to clips shorter than .5. it actually does not give me the option to even adjust the time frame to those animations if the clips are shorter than .5 which makes it harder for any transition edit.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,i would give this a five but when i export it .. it keeps loading and when i added the pictures for the video... the the pictures where so slow to show it and the music was short after that .... also im frustrated about the glitching..and the videos has been so slow if you see this please fix it!....
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use and very affective I got smooth transition videos even and it is top good. And you can use it for wishing someone a birthday and anniversary and for any purpose. Very useful and entertaining. Aesthetic videos can also be made through this app. You also try it and then I can bet you will also rate it 5 by 5
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really like the app however since last couple of months there is issue with projects exporting! app just got stuck in the middle of exporting and its not because of high resolution or unsufficient phone memory. Hope to be fixed soon!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love the app but i cant upload videos ! I fillied in the form and stuff then i got an email saying thank you for choosing capcut but when i try to upload like the videos (which i watched for help) its not doing anything. They say to upload the video and export it then click upload which is under the 'export to tiktok ' button but i dont have that button so i cant upload.Ive pressed share to capcut but it then says the file is not supported.üò™
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I do like this app but I have some problems, 1. It freezes the video when I reverse it, 2. It brightens up when I export it and reverse and it's annoying, 3. SINCE WHEN FPS FLAG BECAME PRO LIKE WHY(please remove the pro in capcut and the fps flag effect with the pro on it, please and thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I must say CAPCUT is not doing a great job specially at making the best effects and transitions premium, many people have been deleting CAPCUT because of the premium so I can request that CAPCUT should remove the premium on bubble blur, and more good effects that people often use, it's a good app but annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This editing app has been insanely useful for me and I truly love the app. It has any editing features imaginable. I have been using Capcut for almost 2 years and have not found any issues. There are almost no ads at all.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Almost everything in the app is fine, but I don't know why this last week, everytime I want to move a video or photo in the video my photo/video appears at the end of my video and it's very frustrating and tiring because my video is so long and I have to delete the photo/video and add it especially in the part of the video I want, and most of the times I had already cut the video in the part I wanted and I have to do it again! This makes it takes longer to make the video. Please fix this!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what capcut did but when making use of the camera tracking AI movement, it takes too long to apply and then takes more than 500mb of data to do that. It just takes alot of unusual data. I had 2.5gb of data only to edit 2 videos and was left with only 200mb of data. Howwwww ????? üíîüíîüíî"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good but there's a problem whenever I do it on my iPad whenever I press new project it's says ""capcut requires access to all albums for editing and saving photos"" but whenever I press confirm it's already set?! So idk what's the problem but can you pls fix it?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"PSE FIX. Original sound getting low down when music added. some of the original video sound cant even hear. volume control seem unusable. i can put to max but nothing effected same goes to noise reduction, its took down the original sound rather than clear-up the unnescessary sounds."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,We need more advance features in chroma key to remove the color in detail and professionally. One thing more please we should be able to add shadow to the images we use above the main layer. These features will make the app more power. I'm talking about to introduce these features in desktop version.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like it, yes it's annoying when you need to use pro features but you can screen record it and still have it so it's not THAT big of a deal. I personally really love this app and I find it very easy to use and it's really good for me since I use it to edit gacha life. =) 5/5‚òÜ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for what it is or what it used to be. I used capcut quite a bit but had to stop using it because of bug issues; the app kept crashing and glitching. I started using this app because it was free and easy to use, and I would like to continue using capcut but these issues need to be fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all but sometimes when I'm adding text it glitches out and mixes the words up. An example could be ""Hello there"" the glitch will make it like ""hellloooherettt"" I'm not sure if this happens because I have to update it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hope you can add a sound waveform beneath the video to facilitate the trimming process and mute removal. Also, adding music and sound effects from the device no longer works in the latest update. I hope you can fix this issue immediately."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, and before today, I would've given 5 stars. I was cornered into the 7 day free trial for Pro. Went through with it, and now I'm trying to find where I can unsubscribe to the trial before getting charged (an unknown amount)... but this information exists nowhere in the app. That's shady bad business. If I find that there was no advisor charge after the 7 days... I'll update my review."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great editing software. But why is the option for text to fade in need to be paid for, but fade out doesn't need to be paid. This is very dumb. It never used to be a paid animation. Quite disappointing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It works perfect for me I have made so many videos with it and just love the experience but one thing I don't like is how you have to have premium for everything like if it's a good transition or something like that you can't use it because it's for premium members only and its sad and annoying that you can't use them I would love if you could make them for everyone but if someone want to use it they have to watch like an add or something so they can use it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My experience with this app is overall ok, but before i updated my capcut there was this feature where you can search up templates. Once i updated it... no more templates. I was expecting everything to be permanent on this app but apparently NO. Yes please leave the features in the app and DO NOT take them away.üôè THANK YOU.p.s everytime there is an update for capcut, there is no difference"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was an outstanding editing app until they took away 80% of the features and made you need to pay for everything. It has become very difficult for me to edit my videos, will be switching over to something better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's definitely a good app to start editing if your a beginner I use it all the time it's just the problem is when I edit a video and I go and delete the unedited version of that video thats in my gallery it also deletes the edit version on caput so I have to edit the video first save it to my gallery then delete the unedited version which can be quite stressful because that can take so much space up on my phone when ever I'm editing a long video I hope that this gets sorted out
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Oh my, do I love this app, I use it , then I add more effects on TikTok! But some of Cap cuts stuff is ingenious !!!!! Once I made a video, I added a hip hop type song , I sped up the speed of the video, so it looks like I'm dancing, when in reality, I'm spinning around, but it looks like I'm Michael Jackson!!!! Then a part of the song had a scratching sound on a turntable, and I swear I didn't do anything with my hand or wrist, but the Cap cut AI made it look like i was scratching üíΩü´≥üíæüíøüéöÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really good app!! I love using it to edit videos and make cute things. The only issue is it lags and sometimes mutes the sound of videos. I do think they do need to add a way to zoom in to edit things.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was a very good editing app, i've been using this for ayear now but i hada problem on the new update, when i use slowmotion smooth it looked like i just used motion blur on it and its very laggy.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I would've gave it 5 starts but I took it down 3. First off on my tablet I cannot even type with backspace. Second I have to wait half an hour for the whatever when making a timelapse. Lastly why does over ‚Öì of the features PRO? It doesn't make sense when I need to use the feature for my editing!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app, few very very frustrating bugs and glitches but it is quite easy to use, one huge issue I'm having is I can't seem to log in with anything?? Tiktok, email, Facebook, nothing works. It just says ""Try again in 24 hours"" And then it still doesn't work?? Please fix."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was a good app, untill they started making all the good effects a pro feature, basically leaving us with nothing but effects that make videos look weird a clunky, they basically made this from one if the best free editing apps to something you have to pay for to get even a half decent video"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"would be flawless if 1. they'd stop making everything a pro feature (what happened to ""free and easy to use""???) and 2. if it would stop crashing everything I try to export a 12 second clip with good framerate."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you could add exporting video in background, and rotation of the app in horizontal, or at least when we open video to view before export, so that we can look video in horizontal, so we can watch more details of the video and option for bitrate in numbers when we exporting the video... the rest is perfect. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is a life-saver. Great to use and easy to navigate. But bugs come up sometimes, for instance some text animations are currently broken and do not do what they should when applied. Hope it's fixed soon"

I cant edit sounds I previously added when I click on them as they just disappear and i cant add overlayed photos because it exits my project to the explore page. Super frustrated, what a huge waste of my money and time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut used to be 5 stars but ever since the update it has been terrible. My texts glitch and add random letters, everything has been changed so I can't remember where things are anymore, and I just tried to make a video and it didn't even save it?? This was such an unnecessary update fix the bugs please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I Love the app! But there's one feature I don't like, I don't like when you added the ""fade in"" and ""fade out"" as pro. They used to be free, I get it you guys need money but I really need the fade in, and other people are complaining too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I want to like this app but it has so many bugs on Android. Drafts don't save. Templates glitch out and don't let you add videos. Sometimes I make a whole video then when I save it half my clips disappear. This one simply isn't it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A best application for vedio editing. Contains a lot of feathers such as vedio effect, slow motion, reverse, stabilisation, animation etc. And essay to use.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My experience with this app has been HORRIBLE. As a member, I created a project and was not able to download it. The ""product team"" did not take this issue seriously at all, in my opinion. They wanted 8 days to resolve a download glitch they were having. Basically, I'm paying $8/month for them to hold my project hostage. Such a colossal mistake on my part, becoming a member. Whoever the competitor is for Capcut, I'm paying a full year membership up front. Capcut's loss."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Beat Editing so far. I never really spend money for apps but I actually bought the pro version for this. The only downside is you always have to compress long videos which takes forever to finish. This is not good if you have limited time.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really great app, but what would make it better is a basic 3d feature, please add customisable 3d tilt and effect. And the music search bar sucks, if I search for a song that is on my device on the search tab I won't find it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I gave it three star because, a week ago I had my projects saved and when I went back it said deleted or moved in my device. Capcut deleted my projects that were important. I don't know what I'm going to do. Please fix this. And I think you should add a deleted folder so we can see where our video/pictures go, so if we change our mind we can retrieve them. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wasted a lot of my time. Keeps crashing and failing to apply the changes. Every time it crashes it starts from the beginning applyong the changes. And so on. Regretted buying it. And I paid for the pro version!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its the qorst editing app ever. Its so glitchy and when i export it it dosent look right. I try to rotate the image/video and it just keeps glitching out. Reverse is buggy as well. It takes so long to import videos. I do not recommmend
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is cool when I wants to work but there are so many issues. It won't open my music storage and sometimes the text to speech option is totally busted. Had to uninstall so I can reinstall, hopefully it works."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really loved the app then I started getting ads and all of the sudden I would get alerts that it was pasting from my clipboard. So I believe this software might be spyware. FYI for all those using it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So capcut is very popular,and it's the best FREE editing app.Im a gamer and content creator and capcut really helps me create clips for my YouTube.Although, capcut could actually use some more...Editing touches.I get it, this is free and I can't expect the same result as the results from expenisve apps.But also the new update,from what I know,update means making an app better.But it has made it worse and drastically slowed it down :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE THIS EDITING APP! This is one of the few free editing apps and the quality is AMAZING! Let's me edit whatever I want and there are even templates I can use through tiktok on this app! Super cool! I use this whenever I want to make an edit and it NEVER crashes. Keep up the good work!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great I create my videos by using this application and I can make my videos very easily you can say that it's all in one app. I've use many apps but the most of them was premium and also I have to spend days to create a video. But now by using capcut I can make videos very easily in hours and it's totally Free. THX TO CAPCUT‚ù§Ô∏è
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Am so obsessed with the lagging in the video ,each time I try to sing or talk ..my voice is slower making me to be lip syncing,my mouth will run first b4 voice comes through .. And the video is slower in action ,like it doesn't play very smart ,just like it is in slow motion ND is disheartened,plzz. I guys should plzz fix dis fr me"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although this app has more features for a free edition, selecting old videos from the gallery is a pain due to a missing scrollbar in the app. Please provide one that makes the selection of videos much more convenient."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hardly edit, but when I do, the app just gets worse and worse everytime. Why is FPS Lag locked behind a paywall now? Why are so many of these locked behind a paywall now?? I get you guys need to make money somehow, but this is ridiculous. I'm not sure if it's an issue on my end, but the whatever I'm editing just lags during the process once I actually start adding effects or something similar. It's ridiculous."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good editing software in there lots of tools that you can use on the templates are really good and funny so then you should definitely download it but there's one thing that catches me off it's when you try to upload a video on YouTube you have to do it two times
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything's being put behind a pay wall. it's impossible to use anything atp. fps lag, weird & yandere filters are going behind a pay wall soon (I use these v frequently) and I can't afford cc pro considering it's usually 14 dollars a MONTH. I don't think anyone uses capcut enough to spend that kind of money. just stop putting everything behind a paywall? there's already ads everytime I open the app anyways. maybe let us watch ads to unlock cc pro stuff? any sort of workaround would be better"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I tired it this app would not let me edit and say that my network isn't work when it literally is, but what I'm saying is I really can't do anything at all and I can't even sing in with tiktok cause it saying not able or something like that and I don't understand because everything is working on my phone except for this app capcut yall need to fix this please"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great but what I hate right now is that they are making effects that weren't pro, pro. It's like they're trying to make us buy they're stuff. For example, FPS lag, it was a free effect with no pro, but now they are limiting the free no pro. Great app, but I think they should leave the free effects alone and not make them into pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app does not work first of all the templates are useless if you try to edit the clip you inserted it kicks you out when you try to export to tiktok it loads forever until it decides to kick you out when you edit a video you can't even watch it while editing because it glitches and AGAIN kicks you out this is just rubbish if I could give it 0 stars I would. Don't even waste you time on this NOT WORTH IT
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and all, but with the new updates it doesn't run smoothly and it bugs out on my phone now, I tried using an animation and the part that let's me adjust the time it goes off the screen, and it won't let me adjust it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have tried many times to search for a certain template. I relog this app, clear data and even restart my phone when i try to click on search for template but it always turn out to be ""Couldn't load. Tap to try again."" Please fix this bug as soon as possible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't open with features because it keeps malfunctioning. For example, I can't add fonts that I want because it often appear as there is no internet connection despite me using wifi. I can't even connect the app to my social media accounts. Please solve this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I like that when you do projects you can use ur own audio from different vids in ur gallery, But i dont really like the song choices tho. Theres not that many. Overall i love the editing stuff. Keep up the good work!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay look here's the issue You know how you can become a template creator? Yes. I applied multiple times all declined even though they are good edits and I'm over 18 but overall not a bad app... For people who want this app Pros: alot of sounds, transitions and many more Cons: it keeps bugging and half of the app is PRO"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At the beginning it was a very good app but after many updates, it just started to hang and you can hardly edit videos anymore. In addition, it was better back then because you didn't have to pay any money for good effects, now you have to pay for more than the half of them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app actually for editing for fun and for making school projects,the only reason why I gave 3 stars only is because I can't use many effects and features coz you need to upgrade your capcut to pro and it's just a waste of time and even though I tried,it's hard to upgrade your capcut to pro,please fix this,I know that it's not just me but many if us don't like the pro ,that's all"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What happened? I've used this app for a long time. For 2 years. For my videos with over 130k subs on youtube. For the past week. It is extremely laggy. It starts off well then it lags midway. I can't even use the app like this anymore. Please fix it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love it so much it is SO easy to make and edit it has been helping me with youtube and tiktok it is the best edit software and it's free. But there are some problems. My quality easily gets ruined with it and when I make a little more than one minute thing it lags horribly.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good but could be better. Instead of not allowing people to use video clips that are longer than whatever the template calls for you could give them the option to edit the clip so that it fits within the template
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the templates they added. They're fun and nice to play with. I think that it would be better if you could use pro when you are at a certain level of editing, and that way, you can get pro instead of buying. But I think that is how marketing works. 4/5"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow, the lag has gotten worse. It now lags when it reaches 2+ mins. And it's even worse than before. And you are not even fixing it üò°. Why are the developers being so lazy to fix this lag? Literally half or even every user is facing this issue. So why can't you just fix the lag? It literally lags even if you tap on something. If there were negative numbers to rate on play store I don't know which negative number I would choose. Do you literally expect us to export a video 10 times?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Capcut since 2021 and so far, it's the best editing app ever. At this point, it doesn't really bug. I love the idea of Capcut making a template connected to Tiktok, because it makes my life easier in editing videos, it's also really easy and entertaining."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm actually so disappointed. I've used capcut for 4 years for my YouTube channel and it used to be so smooth and you had so much option for FREE. Since more people started using it because of tiktok, almost nothing is free anymore and it's glitchy a lot. This is very disappointing because capcut was really a hidden gem and now I have to find a better app. It's sad how people just do things for money nowadays"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but it won't let me go to for you page so I have to uninstall it and install again which is really annoying and a waste of time but other than that it's a good app for if you want to start doing Youtube and become a youtuber but can't think of any video ideas and a good app to edit long videos
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's really amazing üòç ü§© I really like it üòä.. But! For few days capcut it's not working when I try to edit my project the screen would be black and stuck off üòî.. When I download it whole video stuck off and screen are into black.

It works on my dads phone but on my phone it sucks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I want to like this app, I really do, but constantly, when looking through sounds and writing text, it laggs badly to the point where my app is extremely slow. It was one of the best apps at first to one of the worst."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The reverse won't work properly. When i try to reverse a moment of a video it changes to a reversed moment in the footage minutes or seconds after the actual moment I'm trying to reverse. And i can't trim the clip backwards to fix it because it pretends it's the correct moment of the clip. Please help me and fix it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is actually very good for editing etc. Recently, I have came across a situation where my network is perfectly fine but capcut keeps on saying that I have no Internet connection. Please fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really good but lately I've been having issues I've been trying to import videos to edit and I've imported videos longer than 1 hour before. But this was 30 minutes and it blocked it for me and I was trying to edit for my youtube channel
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,i have found a lot of mysterious features within this app and very interesting in the way they work. Am really privileged for that and very humbled. At first i didn't know how to use some of them though I wanted them but after a while i started catching up and now I can at least use many of them. Capcut is now becoming an incredible software to my side. i thank all the custodians of it's building your really doing a great work. Thanks.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I had a class project and this worked really well to edit the video. It was just a little annoying that I couldn't download it onto my phone ( or I couldn't figure out how). It was also a little hard to send the video to my teacher.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I play the video, it speeds it up to 3 seconds, but the audio stays the same, making it jank up the rest of the video. I'm not sure how to fix it. I have deleted the app a few times and reinstalled it, but nothing works"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wrost experience....My capcut is not showing any template or not connecting with wifi or data connection i don't why as i have given all the permissions. I have downloade it again and again but nothing happens. I'm not even able to use it with net Kindly resolve my issue
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good but very glitchy. You could start a project and the clip is un-synced so when you cut the clip its at a diffrent spot than you thought. The more updates added the more glitchy and worse the app is. Besides that the app is good and kinda easy to use
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think capcut is amazing everything works smoothly however, the only thing that bugs with me is how long it takes for a 10 second video to load we need to fix it because it shouldn't take 5 minutes for a 10 second video to load."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its an amazing editting app I must say but, went u edit something, it always lag and it even glitch the ending of my edit, and while I was editting my video it showed that it's on beat but when I upload it, it's not on beat anymore, I put all my effor on my vids and the only thing that drives me crazy is it's lags.."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good editing app but when I try to put the sound effect in the video the sound effect didn't show up. And also that was an animation video so I worked hard on it. So please fix this
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Seriously what is wrong with this App even after the updates all it does is close right after you click on it and only opens after you click on it like 70 times, this is annoying and rediculous is ANYONE ever going to fix thisü§Øü§ØüôÑüôÑüôÑi would give no stars if i could!! Fix YOUR app!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,There's a bug in the mobile app. It keeps closing automatically during editing. Kindly fix the bug. I want to suggest that you provide a syncing for user accounts so we can have one account and be able to access our work on either device platforms (computer and mobile).
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good app and I use it to edit LOTS of things. Anything that needs to be edited I use this app. The only part I want to mention is the fact that you cannot screen record. If this was made possible, I would honestly love that because I use a Samsung and it doesn't have that built in feature"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to make amazing edits on it, however somewhy now it just doesn't let me apply animations on clips and don't let me make them longer or shorter. Absolutely horrible. I don't know why this happened. It used to work perfectly. Please do something. Thank You!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and all it's features except for the fact you removed one important feature which users mostly use for video especially when it comes to dancing,we need that camera tracking feature and I will be glad if you would be able to fix it THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's a glitch where the effects I put in my videos are phantom, like I can't select the effects, I have to guess where it's located, and when I select the effect that is invisible, it suddenly appears, and when I unselected it, it dissapears. I hope I described it well."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Creative freedom with the ability to express yourself to the fullest. Yes PLEASE! The subscription is nice but not necessary at all to complete many unique and amazing projects. Your mind is the limit.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Bro, this is a good app but capcut pro is annoying and bad! I wasted my money for the pro version of the app and the filters don't even work anytime I use them on pro. The edits are good though. at least it's a good app (before the update)."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app but until today when I cleared out space on my phone and decided to reinstall the app. But there was a problem... LETS just say that didn't go as planned. It didn't want to even install and kept saying, ""Can't install app, leave feedback!"" Like what does that mean. I hope people know how to fix this cause I have no idea how."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using it for quite some while now, every now and then. Recently, it started having problems. It won't open videos. Such as a video i made for time lapse about 37 minute.. Please sort out this bug."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give it zero star if I could. I used to use this app to edit my videos and post them but deleted it for I had no space. I redownloaded it for the same purposes, but it cannot even export my videos now properly. I also very much dislike that so many good templates, require money for membership."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything work good for me , but when i post template there not show overly manage option. And after post template , i try to using template, there is no have overly change option, only u can change main layers. Then i install the old version 10.1.0 ,there i can manay or change the overly. So i still using old version. Request to fix problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely amazing experience and never actually bugged for me i like that capcut makes your editing experience easier and more fun it is simple but hold in hand i love how its even a litle social media for the point to show templates and creative idea 5 star but 1. Wish: to much cool effects wich are only for premium
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app to edit, I use it all the time. But the annoying part is when you export a vid you edit or a template it loads very badly sometimes. But overall great app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why do you keep making the app worse. I've been using it for 2 years and nothing has gotten better. How do you have such little caption font selection when that's a main reason people use this app is for tiktok clips so it should be tailored to the audience you have. The amount of bugs that happen makes me want to boycott this app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app but now it is becoming so slow when I go to put pics in the template the words don't match with the picture as it should. It really needs to be fixed and sometimes it will show the sound and everything but as soon as I download it to my phone it's not there anymore.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible. Ever since Pro came out the app stopped letting those who can't afford pro to have a small limit of using anything on it. Absolutely horrible experience. Almost everything is pro and those who can't afford it can't choose a good effect or anything to use freely anymore.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is great for editing but I can't give rate this app. Actually last few days in this app not correctly working. When we have any video edits done and where showed doesn't look etc then after few seconds video has done and automatically on TikTok app. But now a days it's not correctly worked
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lags too much. Sounds won't load, and it keeps saying no internet connection even if I'm on wifi or just mobile data. Hopefully, this app gets another update to fix those issues. Until then, I'm putting 2 stars for now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its free and easy to use. Has no watermark (only logo shown in the end which you can remove). It has no time limitations or any limitations at all. And if you'r doing some short form videos, it has some premade templates. I recommend, even if you'r a beginner in editingüëçüèøüòÅ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Slow motion never works right, you always make ALL OF THE GOOD FEATURES FOR PRO!EVEN MOST I HAVE USED BUT THEN PUT FOR PRO!Effects DISAPPEAR!The fade out animation for the words have disappeared, I CAN'T upload templates.

NOTHING. FIX YOUR BS APP GOD DAMN."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has too many bugs, I love it, but please fix your bugs. I have gotten frustrated because I was trying to make a meme from a template, I was writing it out, and the text didn't match what I was writing. Also, the audio didn't work either."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is frustrating because whenever I tap the search button on the search bar, it doesn't load up. Instead, it just says 'Couldn't load up, try again.' It's really frustrating. Please fix this issue. I will give this app a 5-star rating if this issue is fixed. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Users love the ability to make edits and create cool premade templates. However, some users are frustrated with frequent updates and glitches. The app offers free options that are highly recommended, but the premium version is considered expensive."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This was an amazing app but now all my files have been removed and 'corrupted' the app continues to crash no matter how many times i re-install it i have no idea on how to fix it this app was my favourite editing app but now its just useless and i post my edits which take hours even days to make the previous edit took 3 days and capcut bugged i didnt even delete anything and i cant even add extracted audios anymore

But some of the new things are getting annoying.. everything used to be free but now it's not. From all the effects that became pro, why FPS Lag and Split Flicker? Why would you make them pro in the first place..? Please fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is very easy to use. it's a good editing app. this app is a great way to edit your Video's, You can add text, sounds, use templates, effects, and more. I truly want to give this app a full 5 stars. capcut is so easy to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Genuine question, why tf would I buy pro, when the free version doesn't even work? I've tried exporting an 18 second video 5 times now just to have it turn out glitchy. (Update on the 18 second video, it took 12 tries before I finally figured out that all the available canvases cause the video to glitch out so I just settled for the void of black for the canvas and that worked) really disappointing though cause I was thinking about getting pro üò°üò°üò°"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The music recommendations are not very good the the app randomly stop working and makes me have to completely restart many times over before I can actually make a video and when I finally finished and exported the video, none of the text I put saved"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app helped me much. although recently I noticed many PRO(Premium) features popping out crazy mad. It took over Effects and Shadings,.It truly dissapointing. I hoped that still I can make something creative in this app and not full of premium"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Spent so much time adding photos to the clip only for it to not save any of my progress when I go to preview it. Did this a couple of times with the same issue. Gave up. Not worth using.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My account was banned because of age requirements, already sent emails, IDs, vidoes, photos, talked to customer service (which is like talking to a door), nothing was done. I paid pro feature and had to cancel it because is banned. Seriously? More then 10 days now, with no response. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. App is nice though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's my all time favorite editing free app. But the issue is it keeps freezing and it's really annoying and im so irritated rn. I put alot of effort on that one project and when i play it it always froze like what. I hope y'all fix this soon im hoping..
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's 3 stars at its very best, you can do alot of things with it, but as an editor is very frustrating because they keep changing the filters constantly and it's full of technical issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Although I absolutely love this app, it had this glitch with animations where if your clip is too short, you can't adjust it. But it's an overall amazing app, and I definitely recommend it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,When I have a clip that's under .5 seconds that I put an animation on the animation extends how long the clip is and if the clip is too small then I can't adjust it to fit how I would like it too and it's getting really annoying with fade outs and fade ins.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why can't it make me log-in? I've tried multiple times on my iPhone, Android, Xiaomi or any phone I have, it still won't let me log-in. I tried checking my system or WiFi but it seems fine, I think it's the app or something. That's why I'm giving it a solid 2 because it's still helpful in editting, but I can't use templates."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It has been so laggy lately. When you edit up to 5 minutes or more it stops and the app closes by itself. Although this is very essential for students to get templates and easily edit their videos

Just one thing that I hate about this app, which is almost every single effect is a capcut pro effect, and now some effects that used to be free became a pro effect, for example vibration flash.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So I'm paying for PRO. Every time I go to use a PRO feature it tells me I need to pay for PRO. Yet it's active in my subscription and I'm being charged for it. This will be the second time I'm charged without someone solving the issue. Not even a mention of money back for services I'm paying for and not recieving.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Some footages are corrupted"" This came out after I finished editing for several hours. I kept redoing my edit and have enough! This better be fix. And the other thing is, this app is becoming greedy. It was supposed to be free‚Äîwhat happened?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a great app! I use it all the time when i edit my videos for yt and for fun. There is just a slight problem. I recently made a long video and added some pro features (btw i didnt buy pro). So when im done and start downloading the video, it doesnt let me saying that i was using pro features. So i took away all of the pro freatures in my video and then i click download. It still said that im still using a pro transition even though i got rid of it. Can you please fix this?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You need to fix your lags and glitches. I always update the app. Everytime I enter a text, it glitches the words and I have to start over. The app is also glitchy and slow when I look at templates."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app, but it gives me so many notifications, and I know I can turn them off, but what if I need them on. And there is nothing to edit. But it is ok"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2 star and I'm being generous. This app is so annoying now. It was previously a very easy app and I enjoy using it to edit my videos but now it takes a long time to compress a video before I can even select it to be edited. I've gotten used to the app and it's annoying I have to look for an alternative.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good app overall. but I cannot see some of my audio files. please make it so we can see all the our audios. that is the reason why I sometimes use kinemaster over capcut. it is more easy to see my audio files.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app However, Since The Add of Pro Effects the App has Little free effects witch The number is decreasing. Soon the app might be unusable Unless we Pay for Pro. Overall it is a great app with a good community and its easy to navigate and use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good for editing. I always use this app while editing. I have to give only two stars because this app's transition animaion and bground etc are not loading. We use 5g internet service but they says ""No internet Connection"". PLEASE CAPCUT TEAM, SOLVE THIS HOW FAST POSSIBLE. #capcut #capcutteam"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Solid I don't always know what I am doing but they have great training videos to explain most things and when I had issues it took less than 24 hours for them to get back to me by message which is pretty fast. I also have pro but that has nothing to do with my rating other than insee the value in paying for it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for over a year now, my storage was running low and I have to re-install it. But when I was about to edit and use the smooth slow motion, the smooth slow motion was choppy and wasn't smooth at all. Can you fix that?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whenever I upload a long video it takes so long to export. I don't wanna wait for 1 hour until the video is finished exported. Pls fix this problem with long videos and other videos that can't export. I'm gonna delete this if you don't fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,They are taking to many features away. I liked the cut out feature but all of a sudden its gone. I used it yesterday and went to use it today and searched for it. Im probably going to find a new editor someone told me to go try the VN app so that's what I might so
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good, but it's laggy asf, when you tried putting clips, it lags when you play/watch it, also when adding overlays, effects, texts, and transition, and also crash multiple times."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"horrible at getting frames right when editing actual videos. Trying to zoom in on a certain part gets you frames from earlier or later in the video then what you wanted. good app, needs major improvement."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly , i love editing and this app is very easy to edit vedios it keeps less time and give great quality but there is one problem in it is the font urdu doesn't work i love urdu lyrics but whenever i am trying to write the Urdu letters it wont work so that's why i edit vedio in this app and write lyrics on inshot so i just want to say please correct this Urdu Font problem because i don't wanna go on an another app ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This happens to me too often and it's very annoying. I accidently use a pro feature. I get rid of it. And when I'm done with my video I can't extract it because apparently I still have pro features on. Now I have to reset my whole video.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Honestly I hate how most of the best effects are made for people who have capcut pro. I can't make good edits anymore cause of the effects you guys put in capcut pro I can't get that! The yandere filter is now for pro the vibration flash too the smart sharpen ect. Can you please make less things for pro cause I can't edit good anymore cause of the capcut pro.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is bad at exporting videos. Like I can't even export a 20 second video because of the app getting stuck at ()% while exporting. It's very annoying. Please fix this issue.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use and it's really helped me elevate my content creation. Whilst I do pay for pro (and it's worth it), the free options are more than enough for those starting out or might be on a budget!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is so laggy and unoptimized. Good luck trying to edit only to loose your work in 10 minutes when the app crashes and the project is corrupted! There's no way to recover the project after so convenient!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app gets you caught up with all the trends if you don't have tiktok or any other app like that and it is great for editing but you have to pay for fonts and other little this but this app is a overall four out of five if it was a little bit more free like less this for you to buy and less adds it would be a five out of five but for now it's a four out of five. Hope you have a blessed day ü´∂üèºüåüü©∑ü©µ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its a good editing app but I have one massive hate with this is that next to the full screen and play button is a invisible bar that if u put your finger on it it will drag u to the very beginning of other points of the video they need to remove this feature cause its so distracting.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was a good app I used to edit thousands of videos but since they now make it impossible to edit anything without having premium, I'm deleting the app and trying some other editing softwares, took all the good settings like ""shake"" and smart sharpen and ruined it, completely unacceptable"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I would say it's good for making edits but the templates are another level they are awesome but it kinda ruined the app just a bit it dose the editing for you so u can't edit ur self because most people use templates and lie that they did it but other than that the app is perfect as it is.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a wonderful editing app, but what I wonder is why is Capcut taking away most of the good, free effects? I am an editor, and it annoys me when almost every effect I want to use is premium.. :( Most of the people on Capcut dont have the money to get premium! Please make it so we can use the effects that were made premium again. Thank you :) Dont be like Video Star."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive used capcut for a year without any major problems. Aside from glitches and lags, capcut is a good app. My only concern is that capcut is putting almost every effect on pro, basically forcing you to pay to use the effects that used to be free."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Hi ! thank u guys for ur effort putting together one thing that i experienced is wn i wanted to crop an image it can't just do it appropriately n could not find some icon like edit so was really dumbfoundedounded . Thanks hoping to see changes coz will like to still love to use the app .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm sure many people had said this but please please please fix the bug in your app. I have no issue editing big size videos before this but now it's lagging a lot and there seems to be no improvement has been made since then. I might even consider using another app at this point.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Capcut has always been my number one for editing even though it's so limited. But pro coming in and taking away the few really nice features I had is really irritating. Please stop taking more so we'll buy pro. Just create stuff for it. Don't take our free features
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app for editing my videos but most of your features are now PRO. I hate that I have to be a member of PRO to even use simple features now. Please rethink your decision and change the feature back to the original. I don't want to use PRO, it's annoying and a waste of money"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app, but a meh to me. Whenever i try to use this app, it doesn't let me enter and crash everytime. No matter how many times i enter, it'll continue to crash and crash. Good but annoying app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. I use it everytime I make a video, but it's not the best. Even on my computer it glitches and on my phone too. If I upload a bigger video it doesn't upload good and it gets a bad quality. I honestly rate this app 3 stars. I could've put less but I love how you can use effects and other stuff. Waiting to get better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its a great app its very easy to use but sometimes my video doesn't export and it is very leggy when you use too much effects and filters or adjust to make youre videos great I wish you guys can fix these problems.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update, I finished up a project and when I want to save it It said ,""become pro""That makes no logical sense! When I click on it it says I am already pro! I uninstalled reinstalled filled all the basic information, When I get to the part of sign in the options of, TikTok, Google, then now says that I have to be 13 to use CAPCUT. I'M LIKE WHAT THE HECK I'M 46 YEARS OLD AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM, UNTIL THIS NEW RECENT UP DATE. I WAITED 24 HOURS, AND IM PISSED"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Infuriatingly slow. Used to be more useful but the amount of stuff behind a paywall is annoying. It's fine, but I'm mostly annoyed at the amount of time I spend waiting for stuff to load."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new changes of CapCut. Taking away free effects, filters, etc. from us is just disrespective. As an editor who uses the Vibration Flash specifically very MUCH, I'm disappointed in this app. It doesn't deserve 5 stars. I definitely do not recommend CapCut for people who do not want to pay for good effects, Ex: Flash effects. This app is disappointing to me, And many other people. I really hope that the CapCut devs/creators change the app back to the better. Hell, I can imagine 2024.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Capcut is amazing. It's basically a mini after effects on your phone. The fact that it's free is also incredible. There are so many types of videos you can make like tiktok edits or real movies!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm on android and whenever I add clips. Or do anything it just crashes. I can even export my videos it just doesn't load. They need to fix this definitely won't recommend.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am very upset and disappointed in cap cut , I recently had to get a new phone because my old ones battery was ready to explode and when I downloaded capcut on my new phone none of my freaking projects are there like none at all not even one. That is not okay. Then if you wanted to login to capcut with a different email than the one your logged in on it won't let you it jus automatically connects to the one you logged into at first!?!?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"u need to watch ad to export the video but , the ad loading are too long . is this bug or something ?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good editing app, but it's kinda hell to work with. If you add too many filters, stickers, ect. It can become so glitchy. But it does have cool editing things you can do."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My videos glitch out all the time and are not saved. For example, my perfectly fine audio just decicede to stop working because caput went crazy. And I have to pay for every feature. 1 out of 10 do not recommend"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this App! It's user friendly and helps me create videos as fast as they come to mind. This is the first time I've actually gone into a review to edit a comment. To the forward thinking team behind the Capcut scene...thank you.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm kind of Annoyed at capcut for this one. I used some of the effects FOR FREE for the longest time and now all of a sudden some of the basic functions like Fps lag are pro. Dont get it it's not worth it it jut feels like they are trying take yor money at this point
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In the last version, it was actually okay but this latest version of it is killing me üò≠ It's hard to edit the pictures and vid, when I cut / split the picture and delete it, it is not deleted really, there was it still but what was just shown is a black screen, tf"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think overall that this app it very nice it is good for kids and it allows them to make content like little videos and stuff like that but you can watch tutorials on how to make edits but the only thing that I don't like is that you can make a comment on a video if you in templates and that where online bulling starts you can choose to post an video or you can save it on your camera roll
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's so bad when you export it and use it in a video it plays for 9 seconds then just turns back don't download if you want your day to not get ruined. 0/10 ill make it better when they fix it. Deleting.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's amazing but the reverse is not working and it keeps glitching for everyone if they could resolve it and I don't like the pro I think they should just make it all equal so we can edit although it's super!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is cool to make shorts collage videos but it's hard to get back to it after you post the video that you made on Tiktok .. . Like once you go back to the app after you post the video the screen and you have to wait 5 to 10 minutes before you can go back on the app to make other videos and that's what I don't like about this app

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app, honestly. But it needs a few changes, like it glitches alot with only one effect on an overlay. Kinda needs more effects (like ae type shakes: s_shake, not copying the exact sapphire but similar to help with editing)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app came from a 4.5star to a 1star. I'm aorry but it's functionality over features. It has many feature's but too many bugs. When I'm editing something for example, i press play and the timeline is not moving at all. I have 0 ways to use it. It literally is good only for TikTok templates and not even for that cause even there the clip si moving in 3fps."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The reason I'm giving this a one star is because it's so HARD to edit, for example something that I didn't type is there which is not a problem but if your on mobile then that becomes a problem.Why else am I giving this a one star well pretend yourself recording on camera put some music and record boom now just edit.Thats actually another problem because,when you press stop it just doesn't stop recording.Again it's not a problem but if you don't have a pillow then your gonna get back problems."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,So it was good for a while but it's gotten increasingly worse over the time I've had it I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem but when I add new text it resets back to the basic font and doesn't save my color or font from the other text and its very buggy and laggy

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,nowadays my editings aren't going through infact it's just stopping at 30% to the extent that I uninstall and install it back but it's still the same thing
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app because you can make amazing videos with this and it also has no ads and you don't have to put you detail or you email into it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I do editing and honestly, capcut is the best editing app out there. But yesterday when I tried to put animations, it wasn't loading and it was saying that I have no internet connection. I don't know what happened. I tried everything. I deleted the app and downloaded it again. I lost all my projects to make the app work again... But still, nothing. I don't know if it's a bug but if anyone have anything that could solve this problem, please tell me. Overall, the app was great"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I make a video, like a few days later it says ""Video has been deleted or moved"" and I dont know how to get them back."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CapCut's layer system is overly complex, leading to confusion for users. It would greatly improve the app if all layers, like text, audio, and effects, were neatly organized under the main video. Also we can't change text layer. This simple change would make editing much more straightforward and intuitive for everyone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is one of the worst editing apps bugs crashes I've lost 3 full edits to bugs and almost every useful feature is locked behind a paywall i get it you need to make money somehow but at least fix the god dam bugs. Im gonna learn alright motion now goodbye.

All effects were free and now I cant export my old videos bc some of them is now pro. Second, whenever I add a lot of effects and stuff, it always lag even though I only added 2 effects like ugh so annoying!! I can understand the pro capcut thing but the lag is a big no for being a editor"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, being using CapCut for years, but now the app seems to be Pay to do anything. Especially the free effects that turned into Pro. I know you can call me poor, but it just seems unfair that an effect that was priceless turned into purchasable."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience of Capcut is very good . I am very impressed with him. It's easy to edit things from Capcut .

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app, but my CapCut Pro randomly disappeared and I can't get it back. Still a good app, regardless."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IT HAS A LOT OF BUGS ESPECIALLY WHEN OPENING IT HAS A PROMPT MESSAGE THAT SAYS ""PLS UPDATE THE APP"" EVEN THO MY APP IS UPDATED AND IT WAS DOWNLOADED IN PLAYSTORE/APP STORE NOT MODDED. I HOPE THIS PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED ASAP"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Trying pro and am wondering why there isn't any customer service. Last year they has a feature that easily marked out moving objects and now they don't. Not so fun to be paying for an app that's less user friendly

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app a lot, but I don't really now. This was a pretty good app to create videos and templates with and it was just plain out fun to use. The problem is, when I tried to make edits or something, it would kick me out and not save. And I'd have to start all over, making myself irritated. Also, when I'm exporting a video, my screen would randomly turn grey. Other than those problems and other similar problems this app is great. And I would love you to please fix these issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I give it 3 stars because it's so good and useful but it says that the version is not secure and it said I should download the latest version even though I did
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is so fantastic but one problem that is Urdu language . Urdu language is useful for add writing something in video or pics . So kindly solve this problem.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,you can edit a lot of videos on this so I love it so much you can post it on this app or you can send it to tik Tok if you have tik Tok .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing really easy to use and has a lot of effects, filter ect but it lags a when I put effects on the edit so I have to export it every time I want to check on my progress so please fix this but everything else is amazing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since the latest edit the annoying security notice just keeps popping up even though I downloaded it on this app store
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this WAS a good app, all effects and animations free and fairly good quality, and smoother playthrough. that is, until pro came. the app is so incredibly slow and the sounds are always delayed once you export the video. most things you need to pay for now and its impossible to sit through an export where you have to watch a few ads. I thought this was supposed to be a free app where everyone could use it, but ig not. bring back the old capcut !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using CapCut, so far this is the only editing application I know and succeed producing a decent something. There's a lot of good editing option to use. Too bad if you're poor and can't afford the app purchases, you can't use the PRO features, giving you the inconvenience to find alternative. Anyways I just love the sound effects, voice changer, speed adjustment, splitting the video, and the text and the fonts. It's superb, I'm giving it 4 stars.‚ú®"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Dont even know where to start. Literally the BEST editing app ever. Easy, understandable, and has a lot of features to choose from. I have been using this app for 5 years already and it has helped me A LOT with editing and I also learned a lot from it. The variety of animations, transitions and effects is unlimited. However, the music range is very low quality. Adding trending sounds might really help to make the edits more appealing. Overall I would onehundred percent recommend for new editors."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As an editor. I am not usually used to crashing and bugs. For example, I dont have any problems of my files. But it actually lags. And I dont know the reason if my storage can't handle the situation or anything of an upgrade. But infairness, this app is pretty well made and easy to learn. But I consider you not taking down some effects and transition. so I can't make it any better. I recommend this actually! keep up capcut, I've been using this for 7 years,yet this is the best editing app ever."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Using this app is good overall, but many free features turned into the Pro features, I'm starting to get concern that only basic animation, transition, effects are free. It doesn't really look good on the video, and for another problem, whenever I added Video effects, my phone lags and freeze, I feel quite frustrated and stressful whenever that happens, please solve these two problems."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very overrated thanks to Tik Tok allegiance. There are so many basic things it can not do. For example, when I add a sticker picture on top of another, it puts the one I added on top, behind, where you can barely see it. Also, when adding an item, it only adds to a tiny section on the bar, and when I expand the bar, it goes so fast that it goes way beyond the end of the video. How can I go beyond an end of something? I really think this app is poor and very, very basic."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a useful app for you to make videos,it has awesome filter's and cool editing features, but there are some type of problems. First one it freezes what your doing and in just a few minutes and goes back working again but eventually it goes to freezing the screen, second it lags everytime we click on some of tools . But this is an awesome app if your learning to edit and easy learn"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much and I have no problems at all with it and if you get it I would suggest to use it on tiktok because I had like 5 likes on tiktok but then I got this app and now I have 8.5k likes so yeah ü©∑
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great editing app to make high quality videos on. However, the only problem is exporting long videos and what happens. At a certain point of exporting (for example at 64%) the app crashes and sends me back to the projects menu. The only way to stop it from happening for a while is to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Please fix this to make this rating even higher üòª"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but every time I slow down a clip and try to apply better quality it looks bad, it doesn't look how it used to look from past updates, it makes it choppy, then if I add motion blur, I dose not matter wether it's set high or low it looks bad! And I've already submitted three requests for it to be fixed. The app needs to be updated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I have been using this app for more than 2 years now, and let me tell you that it changed a lot. What if you developers allow capcut to be used OFFLINE again, like let your users download elements and tools, for example are the effects, text fonts, text animations, video transitions, and everything else that editors use to edit videos. This is just my suggestion, but still, I hope you consider this request and have a nice day"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some reason when I'm finished editing a video it won't export so then I have to clear the cache and it would be working fine. I would always have to clear the cache when something doesn't work and it's annoying. One more thing the stock videos won't load because apperantly it says ""no internet connection"" even tho I'm connected to the internetüòë."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much I spend time on it 24/7 I love editing and much much more thank you cap cut.. but I would like to be a template creator just no paying. and I wanna post everything I make so please let me post just no paying me please I wanna do it for fun

Honestly I thought the app was GREAT until this latest update with the pro BULLCRAP üòí I wouldn't wish this app on my worst enemy and that's saying something.

Pissed off even. This is completely ridiculous BRING COMPLETELY FREE CAPCUT BACK!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Wow. Desktop version is garbage. They have a horrible non 24/7 connection to the internet. But conceptual tool is handy. Bottom line, free version is just a big promotion so that you'll purchase their pro version."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, especially for other people who doesn't know how to edit using other kinds of editing app, so I give this app 5 stars, and I hope everyone enjoyed using this app, that's all thank u"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some features on this app are completely free, while they are sold on some other software like inshot. Plus, it does not have an annoying water mark at the bottom of the video. Besides the fact that it crashes a lot on my phone, a techno pop 2f, it works perfectly fine. I blame the crashing on my phone, not the app. The PC version is also very good. 10 out of 10."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm a Capcut template creator and for me it's important to post a template every other day or if I want to but recently when I exported it and need to post the template it froze and I can't put a title and hashtag even my keyboard is stuck/frozed. I tried everything like uninstall or exit my capcut but it's still the same. My gosh please fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Are you aware that CapCut users are experiencing issues with the image quality enhancement feature? There are multiple users sharing their experience on Reddit posts. The image quality process is stationary and idle at 30%. I just bought the pro version and it worked with no issue the first time but then all of a sudden it doesn't work. I looked up solutions and multiple pro users are experiencing this issue.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app used to be a total 4.5 for me UNTIL they added premium. Before vibration flash and FPS lag (effect) was FREE. Now you need to pay to use it? Those two effects were by far the most useful effects in my editing skill. This infuriates me.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app because of how useful it is for gamers who make content. it is also free. there are also many songs and templates you can use. 5/5 definitely recommend if you want a great editing app

It is possible to fix, but it is really annoying, and requires extracting, cutting, and moving all the audio to make it in sync. Also whenever I export the video, the actual video is delayed so the audio sometimes happens before it is shown."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! Editing is something I've dreaded for years, and I've never seen another free program that was so easy to figure out, yet not very limiting on what you can do. My only issues with the Mobile app is that the volume adjustment feature is a scroll rather than something you can click on and type the volume number you want in on your own. It's not very accurate. Also, the audio and visual sync is always slightly off after exporting."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would be nice I'd I could actually buy capcut pro, it won't let me select either option and I even recorded myself trying üòí"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This may not be an objective issue, but I find that there are many gripes with the editing functions, such as 1) the inability to move keyframes or position them close together 2) the interface requiring a great deal of scrolling 3) the inflexibility of objects on the timeline and 5) the heavy reliance on premade effects. While i don't mind having the options, it was incredibly difficult to make any custom transitions, which in turn made me feel boxed in in terms of creativity."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"horrible. i love this app dont get me wrong, but literally cant do any edits without needing to buy capcut pro. even edits i had used for FREE are now only available with capcut pro. but then if i screenrecorded the ones that were once free im wrong for that. i get that they need to make money but atleast give a free trial for pro."

It glitches a lot and fails exporting half of the time. ""Too many tracks, it may cause lag"". I can't make awesome edits anymore because of that. I've been using the app for a while and all I want is for it to be the best it can be. Please fix these problems I mentioned"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good editing app! I do have some things I want to report, however. Sometimes it lags if I add more than 2 effects. Also, whenever I add motion blur onto the video, it distorts the colouring and It looks bad. I don't know why that happens. Also I HATE the fact that you have to pay now for good effects. What was the point of that? CapCut was better when it was free."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app with a passion, it's been one of the must useable editing apps for me. but just a few problems, I wish the lag on phones would be reduced or something. especially android. I'd also like if projects could be seen on all devices, I made a account and I'm logged in on two devices but I can't see the others projects on the other, if that makes sense. just like make projects able to edit on all devices. and the last one, cheaper and less things for pro, otherwise, it's really good!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your app was amazing, but now its trashy because of the pro features and the sudden crashes and lag because of templates. I'm not sure why it went from being a completely free, amazing app, to being the stuff that other people's video editing app need. Like pro features, templates, and tiktok?? I used to enjoy this, but now I think I should switch video editors."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the idea and concept, even the selection of sounds and music from tiktok is helpful, but keeping the video in sync with the music is a gamble. I have to download any given project as a video to see if it's in time with the music I've used or not otherwise I'd never know because the music and video doesn't quite play\load at the same time\same rate."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The best video editor I've used but one fatal flaw, the audio when you process the video becomes desynced. I'll tell you how upset I got when I edited a 10 minute video i worked on for over 2 hrs, just to find out, the audio is delayed by 1 second please fix this issue, it's the only thing I've found that can make or break my want to continue using this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really great editing app and lives up to its reputation. The templates feature is great for people who are still learning how to use the app, and the app is very simple. The only thing that could be possibly better is the chroma cut-out tool, only because it cuts out parts that have similar colours to the selected colour. The only other thing is the fact that I'm getting the ""capcut not responding"" message even though I'm on a relatively new device and have only installed capcut recently."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the fact that if i import high quality long videos, i have to wait until it compresses. Its just a big waste of time and quality, and audios with big MB's just doesent appear when i try to find it. Disappointed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very very nice app, I've been using this for many years, But there's 2 problems.. First of all, When I applied the ""Mix"" transition then tested it, It won't work, It's not mixing. I even tried to restart the app or edit? But it didn't work, 2nd, When I connect my phone to my Alibaba Earbuds then edit something with a sound, It will dash when I played the video, the video is not matching to the beats when I edit with my earbuds, so please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for editing and all that other stuff, but..when exporting a video (or your own ""project video"") it takes really long and the files are completely big. It's really an issue for me and also sometimes it lags, when I add like a cut scene or an effect on my template it lags a lot and it's quite raging. Don't know if I'll ever be able to use this again but I hope you guys could fix the issue I'm dealing with, thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was really liking this app until I paid $81.33 for a YEAR subscription on May 11, 2023. I was able to make a couple of videos with the pro features. About a month and a half later, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to Pro whenever I made a video with Pro features. Whenever I tried communicating with Cap Cut on this issue, we went back and forth quite a few times where all they did was frustrate (not help) me. I absolutely do not recommend this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using it for a while but when I import a video and I zoom it in it looks clear and good at first, but suddenly everything becomes pixelated, and it also needs to be updated constantly if you want it to work properly, because if you don't update it, it will lag, freeze and things won't show up when you try to. And I have noticed that some things get changed every now and then. Like their picture or positons, and it gets a bit annoying when you suddenly cant tell where some things are."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, trust me, but I have problems with the confusing UI, & the strict paywall that allows you to do nothing. I try my best to edit with this, but there aren't enough useful things. I usually stick to anything Adobe, but I decided to try CapCut, giving it the benefit of the doubt. I uninstalled it later, due to not seeing it as great for edits, and the large amount of storage it took up. Would write more, but the text limit won't let me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's is very easy to to use and helps me make the most out of my edits, on the other hand itay require one to use a large chunk of your data but it would be worth it. I would recommend that Capcut allows people to download the fonts and animations one time only because from personal experience I can say that I hate when I'm offline and I am not able to access any of the effects and transitions. Overall, it is a very good app to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very beginner friendly app! It has a practical layout. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't work with Google Photos, which is where I keep all my videos and images, so I have to use Samsung gallery, which for some reason doesn't have all the images and videos. I contacted customer service, and they got back to me in a few hours üòÅ. I followed their one suggestion, which I couldn't get to work, and also submitted feedback (another suggestion). Hoping this helps me to keep editing!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so incredibly much and would usually give it five stars. Since it's been updated, however, I can no longer edit on my phone without the app crashing or causing my phone's system to crash. I'm writing this review in the hopes that someone can fix this as I'd so greatly love to continue editing on my phone. (I should add that the app works perfectly fine on my tablet device! It just keeps crashing on my phone.)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app has been great for me except there is one major issue. You cannot crop or rotate videos. Those are literally some of the most basic functions that a video editor should have and it doesn't have them. Technically you can crop or rotate the videos but it will just fill in all the cropped out space with black or put a tiny frame inside a big black box when you rotate it. Please fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a great app for editing videos and making templates for others to use but there's seems to be a problem when I search templates, it won't let me. It always says ""Couldn't load. Tap to try again."" And no matter how many retrys, restarts, and reinstalls I did, it does nothing. Looks like it's been broken for months now or my phone is the problem. Idk... please fix it.ü•∫"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It Used to be a 4/5, but this app has seriously gone downhill. Everything lags ALL the time. If you add more than 3 overlays, just pictures, mind you, your video will be glitched. And it's unfixable, even after removing them. Most of the effects and other key items are under a pay wall as well. There used to be no such thing, and as of recently, EVERYTHING has to be paid for. Lastly, I will upload a video in 4k quality, just for it to look like 480p. Seriously depressing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While great for short video content and quick jobs because the TikTok editor is so awful, it's great. However, what knocks it down so low for me is it literally doesn't work for anything else. It crashes and I'm left with corrupted footage. If this was able to work for longer things (I'm sorry but we can do 10 minutes on TikTok, let me do 10 minutes!) then it'd be perfect."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cancelling!! I tried the pro feature - I was about to lock in to a year but changed my mind because... 1. After the last update, it's now taking time to open. 2. It lags a lot on both mobile and desktop. 3. When you make your edit via desktop, it takes a very long time to either share or export (more on export) took forever that I fell asleep waiting for it. 4. Takes forever to apply features such as stabilization, enhance (you'd lose patience) I may still have more which I will add here soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I used capcut for about two years now. It's a very good app for editing, I agree. Though lately, there was uhm.. kinda like too much updates? It's taking my stoarage away. Also when I want to add my clips to the templates right. The photos/videos won't show. Please fix the updates. And also the effects, I use this for free. But lately almost a lot of the good effect I used to use was free but now needed to pay. I wished some at least is free. Please fix more, thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for years because of its simplicity and features. But after Capcut Pro came, I slowly got disappointed with the app's performance and the features since most of it needed premium to unlock, which I hated the most. They also time properly to lock certain effects that are more popular so your forced to buy them or lose it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app since 2020; honestly, it's the best free editing app I've found & it works wonders! You can easily make simple edits, but you can also dive into more advanced editing within this one same app! It's always worked great... expect ever since the pro feature came out.. This is a paid membership for extra features but means non buyers deal with lag, glitches, audio and video correspondence issues, and although is still functional, is disappointing to use with glitches.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use to have a galaxy note 10 and the app worked fine there on,it was amazing,but somehow on this new phone of mine it's terrible,it's so slow. And the slow motion,something is wrong with it,it's making a horrible blur ghost figure when it's on smooth slow mo,whereas before it was plain smooth,it's awful now. And I can't export in 4k anymore,I hate that!!!! The app has really really downgraded I don't wanna lie. I hate this new version!!!!! it needs to be fixed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use to love this app because it is easy to use and has a lot of tools to edit videos. But recently, I was trying to edit a 25 minute video ( which I can do for years) and unable to. I guess when it got famous, they want you to buy the premium instead. It is understandable but there are other free apps in the playstore. Kudos though, but goodbye!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My motion blur is not that good as I see people's edit using it, but overall its a good app. But theres a huge problem, it happens to other people too so I don't think it's just my phone, when I or we add many effects it lags (?) When I add too many effects and overlays etc. it becomes laggy, I hope you fix this soon! But overall capcut is easy to use unlike other ones like alight motion, which in my opinion is hard too use. But I recommend capcut, but please help me fix this motion blur and lag"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love love LOVE, this editing app! Capcut is my favorite editing app I've used, but I do have a few things to say that could be fixed! Whenever I move my images with KeyFrames, it's not as smooth as I was hoping for. If that could be fixed, it would be amazing! And I wish that there would be fewer premium features,or just more non-premium features, that's all tbh! But other than those small things, I love capcut! And I definitely recommend it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app I have ever come across . Its flexible and user friendly doesent glitch like most apps but runs smoothly. It feels as if I'm working on a pc but it's just on mobile . The app has a lot of feature including templates and endless others stuff like stickers , fonts , sounds , songs , transition ,animations and pretty much more .. I really love this app I suggest you should download it and and see it for yourself . Thanks #Capcut"

And this one really annoys me, but the fact at the Motion blur doesn't work is infuriating. Yes, the processing just starts all over again once I've waited for it to get to 100%. I also just CAN'T use TRANSITIONS, yes, unbelievable. The stupid bar at the bottom is just stuck at zero seconds and I can't move it for some reason. Totally not worth my time"

Just recently it hasn't been working and keeps making me ""redownload"" it for what I assume is an update. I even tried the ""basic troubleshooting steps"" but it still didn't work with zero progress. I unfortunately had to delete the app and redownload it which deleted everything. Users shouldn't have to go through this time consuming proccess and sacrifice their previous projects just to use an editing app."

I wish half stars were a thing, because then I'd give it a 2.5 because I still really like this app, but when it does work it does get really laggy. Multiple times when I'm editing/creating a video the audio will glitch out. Overall, I don't know what to think hahhhhhhh"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Listen, the App is great and all until it try to reverse a video. I have no idea why but it starts to make the video glitch as if it's a broken TV or something, please look into this problem because it's makine it really difficult to edit. I can't seem to find a way of fixing this problem. Every other app doesn't even have the option to damn reverse a video."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app! Have been using it since August 2022 to make my Roblox and Gacha edits, which I quit doing, I'm gonna make them again in January, on my yt channel. I also use it for other things such as editing photos and clips, also to make pfp's for ppl. There's just one problem with this app on my end, though. Whenever I try to import videos that are longer than 3-ish minutes long, it lags and freezes, and takes like 8+ minutes to import fully, sometimes it doesn't import at all. Please fix."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app to use for video editing and tiktok trends. But, why does every time I try to use a template, it always says ""Unknown error"" and ""No internet connection"" despite me having strong connection with our Wi-Fi? I tried to recreate tiktok trends but I can't because of this. EDIT: Your app only works on Mobile Data. But with Wi-Fi, it doesn't work. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app in every way possible, I've used it ever since it basically came out, well a few months after but you get the idea.. And it's helped me become a better editor over the years, the only issue I have is that on mobile, when you watch your video with transitions, effects and whatever, it freezes up and you can't tell if it's good or bad, which can get annoying, but other than that I literally adore this app and will continue using it in the future:)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app was better but now it needs to be up*graded* . It lags very frequently. Also it freezes a lot. Many of its features are only available under payment. Especially the text captions ones. Also this languages for caption is so less. Like in tiktok there's Bengali but it doesn't. I have been using capcut for like the last 4 years . But recently it has gotten worse.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used CapCut for 5 years now and this year (2023‚Äì2024) is the downfall of this app. In this past year, I have been dealing with lag, sound delay, long wait times, ads galore, and even more lag. This app used to be the greatest of the mobile video editing apps; now, it's just trash. With the amount of lag I'm experiencing, I thought I was blowing up 1 million TNT blocks in Minecraft. Seriously, I don't recommend this app. I don't think they will ever fix anything. I am now switching apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is it still so laggy AND BUGGY NOW? I'd prefer the app to convert video to something smaller if it's hard for it to work with such a quality, than seeing so laggy app during transitions/animations. The checkbox ""HD"" is so much confusing - please add some information about it - it is either covering to HD (which is 720), or using High Definition video aka 4k. Soooo confusing.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love it, but there's still missing features like: 1. Main video or picture (make always as primary 4 end) don't allow music, text, overlay to surpass. 2.custom folder (ext storage) search it's not working. 3. Quick shortcut bar with: add, delete, split, Move, Enlarge / Reduce Bar, while we press on overlay or music 4. Custom arrangement. While we press on photo. The first thing, which should appear is: volume, adjust, filter, opacity, speed, rotate, basic etc. Now it's messy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: New update made it worse, the search for stock video is removed and keyframe graphs are moved to the bottom section."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your app keeps claiming I'm using pro features when I'm not I've even taken screenshots and video evidence that I've deselected said features and it's still claims that I am and it won't let me export
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I star why?? It is great for editing with not your own template. Firstly Capcut please put a Animation/ Effects pane where you can see all the animation nor effects you putted in the freaking video!! and we can edit it like that or to remove something. Because of the freaking pro that I accidentally put in the video I can't saved it! And I wasted the f4eaking time to find it and noo I did not find it even if I checked on by one each transition for a 5 minute freaking video u hear me?!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like the effects and everything but on my phone it keeps slowing down and my phone doesn't usually do that and sometimes the app just restarts it's self. It is too slow and it's not helping at all if it's going to lag if the creators fix the problem I most definitely change this review to 5 stars or maybe if you tell me what's the problem and what do I have to do.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not, so great app Everything Is Really Meh Aspecially the ai Voice feature like why? It also has pro Wich i dont wana pay for Sometimes it deosnt even load Im better of Sticking with Ae"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the GREATEST editing app EVER in my opinion, and I just like the fact that you can get a 1 week free pro and I've been using pros since. I've been using capcut for about 3 YEARS now and, I will never stop using this app to edit. I appreciate this app soo much. Just... Thank you... The people that created capcut. It's the best editing app EVER."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Loved editing with capcut. It has all animation you need buuut the only thing is that it laaags when there's a lot of stuff added to the video. All in all it's the best editing app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. But will be better if transitions like pendulum 1 and pendulum 2 is near and like that more transitions are near it will be then easy to make transitions... After all, BEST app. Fully recommended ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,As broken now as it was 12 months ago. It can't accurately generate dual auto subtitles+which is what I pay for Pro for!) Edits don't save and cause you to lose hours of work. Just pointless.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app, still getting used to it even though I've been using it for a while so I don't know everything and some things can be hard to understand so I wish it could be a bit more simple because the app is great for beginners so capcut is a really good app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works well, in my opinion. It's the app I use to edit videos or make videos. But I would like to freely upload in capcut instead of having you contact me to say I can upload. If I could freely upload, it would be 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just give 3 star because when I put the text and I put text speech the text its gone pls fix back I turn very mad the text its gone and then, pls don't make all of animation, text, filter and another become pro feature."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,CapCut is my favorite app to edit and create videos for any platform! CpCut even gives you templates to work with and other great features like audio so you can record your voice. Recording options and so much more fun!

But now it seems terrible when it updated, though I am now already having the pro version still it keeps updating for another pro?? Seriously?. I wish I never updated the app. Please instead of updating the app's version why not just improve or put all of its functions in just one simple capcut like on its first version before. I wish I could give you 5 stars but I gotta say only the first version have it not this one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,it's probably a good editing program but if i wanted to do a ticktok edit that i found it always errors that my internet is bad or it's not conected although my internet is perfect and full i tried logging into my ticktok account too but it didn't work
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for beginner editor. I have use this app since 2021 but some of free effects are for ""pro"" capcut which is pretty disappointing because some of it was my fav effects. To be honest I don't really use capcut anymore"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good and very easy to learn how to use but for long videos like after 6 minutes it will crash every time you try to work on the video or export it...I do wish they would fix that
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is an amazing app and probably the best out there for editing being free. unfortunately they are making everything pro features but that's expected of anything free
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Actually it is good but always have to update n it's not working on time. It's taking time to open for tik tok

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's a good app but it's so irritating it always glitches and has a lot of bugs when I try to play my edit it fast forwards which is so annoying and when I try to put an animation on the pictures it gets so laggy
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It keeps adding more rows whenever I'm adding more text or stickers, so I have to keep scrolling up and down to find which text is where, and it's frustrating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When I was 10 I used to love this app but the new update made it worse it doesn't have the templates anymore and the text to speech is gone and the filters won't work
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is good but when I make an edit and make it on the beat of the song and then leave it it will be off beat or when I just export it it's off beat other then that the app is great but if the problem could be solved then it can be better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used one of the AI filters and after using my free uses, I tried to share to get more and it just wouldn't give me my free uses after sharing like 5 times. I shouldn't have to pay $10 because your app is messed up. That's not the way to get people to pay."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I personally love this app you can create so many edits and the perfect ones and all you have to do is click on a template, add pictures/videos, and boom you have an edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the old update was way more better... slow mo was very smooth so as the animation... now, this app is a bit greedy... every animation and slow mo was not smooth... all of the features are now in premiumüòí"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good! The only thing I would criticize is when they make EVERYTHING that ≈¥AS free is now pro, they should just make new effects and make them pro, other wise pretty fine. I just got a new phone, in my last phone nothing exported.key frames can also be improved !"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the update, everytime I add a Overlay video about 5 secs it goes back to the menu same goes to sounds, i have to trim it first before adding and it's annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great editing app with a wide variety of options but this deal-breaker is the issue YOU CANT CHANGE EXPORT LOCATION FOR THE MOBILE APP! They have it on PC they should just add it to mobile editing
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Best editing app for making videos but exporting should be instant because when exporting a long video shouldn't take 40 minutes to finish plus take off the Code Mbs, it makes the video look horrible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can we atleast get premium for 30 minutes just by watching ads?? I rarely use capcut and i only wants to make an edit when something is trending but every time i use capcut and chooses the effects i want it only let me download the video after i bought premium. I don't wanna spend RM30 for a single use though... üòîüôè
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's so perfect if you are boring go to this app I love it sometimes there's ad but 2024 is not cool because you need to watch ad before you can export the video please remove that one.... ;(

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate how this app is basically for people who only get premium, people like myself when they can't get premium we get stuck with the bad transitions, animations, etc. It gets on my nerve because this is just a new thing. I had this app for 2 years and it just keeps downgrading instead of working to be better. It makes my phone super glitchy whenever trying to use it and if you use to many animations it basically crashes your whole editing software. Also takes up a lot of storage--"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Now I use this pretty often given the fact I do railfanning as my hobby. I always used the ""Fade In"" to end off my videos. It really does suck to see it is now for Capcut Pro. Please remove it from Capcut Pro! You are probably damaging other people by doing that! Other than that it's alright."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's an amazing app it's just that it normally stops working when I tap on project the app exits itself but it is a cool app

I haven't used capcut in a while so I went to use it today, and almost everything is pro! This is supposed to be a free editing app, it is very much not free anymore. One of the effects I use the most, halo blur, is now pro and a ton of the text animations, etc are all pro. Used to love this app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a very useful app for me but recently new batch of not-so-good templates were uploaded and were placed on top of the suggested templates. These templates are just photo collages with audio clips that don't have any animation or transition, just a plain photo collage. It's a hassle to browse down just to find good templates."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I can't adjust loudness on my clips. It just loads forever when I click it. And then it doesn't allow me to stop it from loading. I have to force close the app for it to stop. I have an S23 ultra btw.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent app. Plenty of options for customisation but most of the best ones are PRO, which means you have to upgrade to a ridiculous price point to edit on a mobile device?. You might need to consider adding some ads feature."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Previously this rating would have been 5 stars until now. 1) updated version of capcut now demands turning on your data before you can access some editings, which previously could be used without data (this was what even enticed me to the app) 2) Recommended this app for someone. On trying to download it, it now has some in-app purchases. I wonder 3) I observed especially in editing longer videos (20mins+), it gets to a point that the app starts hanging, not synchronizing & stopping on its own"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Such a great app for beginner editors. CC pro is decently priced for the stuff included. It's easy to learn but makes it slightly difficult to learn other editing software as it's a little dumbed down.

I've been using capcut for about two years now, and it's very rare to come across any problems. The only issue is, almost every good thing is PRO. Meaning you have to buy pro to use it. I get that they are trying to atleast make money, but they should have a ""watch ad(s)"" option, since they said ""capcut is suppose to be a FREE., all in one tool."" I ain't sayin' capcut is bad. it's very actually good, i recommend if you're starting out.‚ù§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I am disappointed because I have seen very good experiences but on my phone it won't let me scroll through templates. Usually on the bottom of your screen it says templates but mine says nothing. Any ideas??
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app keeps telling me that there's a security issue as I am unable to edit my video anymore
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it was better before the update. The mobile version is alright (or mid). My only problem is that ever since everyone started using capcut, it went from fully free to now having to pay for the ACUALLY good editing tools. I would rather use something else or learn how to make good edits than to waste money on something I can do myself. But, the free items are still pretty good and the only problem is that the templates kind of ruined many editing communities."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I realized that the colors of the original video and the exported video were not the same and had turned orange after use. That doesn't preserve the original color. In addition, the sharpness of the video is also significantly reduced. Sometimes the app lags and can't handle the Smooth part well"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It can't even register new photos or videos it chooses which new ones to show you hard to explain
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing, and has so many amazing features but the reason I gave 3 stars it's because sometimes it's a bit slow and also you can't add an audio recorded by the phone voice recorder"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app,I love the fonts,effect n how the video turned out to be. But there's some problems that comes in when ur trying to save the video or when downloading the product and also there's alot of changes about the fonts and its kind of confusing bcos the pictures where changed but otherwise the app is so great with the updates and all. I like the fonts but it needs more fonts that many editors are needing so it can help us instead of downloading the fonts again and adding it to capcut again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut now sucks In this day, in may 2023 I love the app, but this update has bugs, unlike the old one, I do not recommend this app today"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why does it keep telling me that I need to download the app again as the current version I have is not secure??? I've reinstalled it 3 times now and still tells me that
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut has been my go to for a while now and I think capcut users can collectively agree that exporting things is very simple and quick. The template feature is great as well leaving many people with ideas for maybe a snap story or TikTok post. Editing is very easy for itself and most buttons are simple to find. If there are any glitches I myself have not experienced them but I can say that it is very helpful to have features that make the app very simple and pleasing to it's users. 10/10

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPDATED REVIEW Dropped the rating from 3 stars to 1. CapCut Pro for PC has not been working at all since the most recent updates. None of the filters, adjustments, or resolution upscaling works. Any video adjustments you make cause the app to crash. Def not worth getting the Pro version. About a month ago only the HD/UHD feature was not working. Now its everything."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I honestly have used this for a while but Some things that's annoying would be that sometimes when I use an effect it bugs and sends me to the beginning, Aswell as when I used text and deleted something that was a part of the edit the whole text was deletes aswell. Sometimes It lags so i have to pray it works out instead. Or maybe when you make a photo too short it bugs the whole thing. But these are only the things I've come up with by experience, Feel free to correct me or guide me."

It tends to lag sometimes when doing graphs or speed curve which annoys me, wide variety of effects and tools to use. I pay for capcut pro and it lags when I use like two pro effects and I can't rewatch my edit before exporting to see if the glitches are in the edit or just from the amount of effects/tools used."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Thought it was a good app until I edited a largeish video for it to lag and then lose my whole video. Very disappointing after spending 3 hours on it. Will be uninstalling and using a more stable and reliable app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It worked fine until I got a 'security notice' my capcut was working for atleast a year or so and it says 'the current version of the app is not secure. Download the latest version in official app stores' not only have I updated it I have deleted it and downloaded again it still does not work so I downloaded it tonight to see if it works and it does for once but when I'm done my text for an edit it says the same text so I can't edit anymore I have to quit thanks alot capcut.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using capcut for my edits but now it doesn't show any effect option. It says ""connect to the internet"" even though I'm already connected.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nice editing app for me, but I hate the ""Capcut Pro."" In order to use effects/anything (that's in Pro) that I'm gonna use for my videos, I need to pay for it. I know it's for the money or stuff, but it's honestly irritating now that i (and other people) can't use those. Please remove it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I am a YouTuber and I think this app has helped me alot and has gotten me tons of views. I recommend Capcut! The only problems is everything is PRO. Please change some of the items to normal because half of the pro items used to be normal, and when I use a template it is really laggy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very buggy and almost unusable. The issue's that plague this app won't be fixed by purchasing pro either. If you're gonna spend money on a monthly editor, there are 50 better ones out there. Good enough for a quick and (very) simple mobile edit, but don't spend money on this kids."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a pro subscriber I'm completely disappointed with the app's new pop-up offers, which have slowed down its performance and made it difficult to use. I hope developers fix the problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just can't with this editor. I tried everything to make my video look like a full screen video, but this editor keeps shrinking it back down. I'm done with this. This editor just made me frustrated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Start your Journey here Explore all the great editing capcut have So many things you can do it's almost like infinite things So many editing things it's perfect for making great videos and YouTube videos Try your experience now So many free things it's the best most free editing app ever But though there is some things to purchase but they're not very important There's more filters if you buy it but you'd have tons of filter done anyway so try it now don't waste your time it's a great app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I was signing in to cap cut, I accidentally put in 2013 and I have to wait 24 hours. After the 24 hours, I tried signing in again and before I could even put in my age and date of birth, it said"" you need to be 13 or older try again after 24 hours"" like, if I wait 24 hours and trying to sign in, it will just tell me to wait 24 hour when I didn't even put in my age over and over again. So now I am not able to sign in any more. How am I going to enjoy having this app if I can't sign inüò°."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Litteraly everything became pro. You can barely make any decent edit without having to either buy pro or figure out how to make the effects on your own. This was a really good editing app until they started putting pro on useless effects. At this rate the app is not even free. They shouldve just made it to buy the Whole app in the app store together because this is stupid.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use and that's why I personally like to use it over alight motion, would have been a 5 if it had better effect like alight motion. Like actual good glowing or maybe good shakes cause man the shakes SUCK other than that I love it, 4/5."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best video editor ever!!!ü•∞üíú I absolutely love this app. this is the first app I've ever used to edit my videos. It's user-friendly, It's easy to use, and it's one of the best video editors apps I have ever used. I would recommend taking the time to play around with this app and learn how to use it. Once you get the hang of this app, it makes editing videos easy peezy. I definitely recommend this app. I promise you won't regret it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's a good app but it's very laggy. It sometimes doesn't even runs smoothly while editing videos or breaks off the download completely so you have to start all over again
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"First few days, everything was going smooth and nice, but suddenly, everytime i try to export a video from a template, which is a slowmo, the outcome becomes so laggy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the worst editing application that I have experience in my entire life. FR I just waste my time for 3 hrs because the technical issues of the application like ??? [ When I'm start using Premiere Pro for the first time still didn't drain my sanity that much compare to this app -.- ]
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I lost many features after latest update. This issues happened because of support team recommended steps. I want to get back the previous version with all features I've lost. otherwise this app will be useless
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is an amazing app so easy to use it can be laggy if you have a lot of tabs and apps but it's really good for beginners but I dislike the pro version cuz it has a lot of good things there but you have to pay other than that it's an amazing app once you get used to it so try it out!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am amazed with this app. Only because I have experienced so many dirty shady apps. The ones that say it's free and then they try to charge you. Thank you for this continued pleasure. I look forward to coming to this app. As it continues to allow me to express my creativity.üëåüôåüëèüßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's an ok app but you need other options to access photos as Google photos and other cloud options, as tou can't get pics directly through your phone unless you download them to your internal phone data"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app! But it's been acting up since october i think? It tells me theres no internet connection, but my internet works perfectly fine! I had to use vpn untill now, I hope this will be fixed soon! Thank you :))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It kept messing up the sound and glitching the video and it would make the video and sound not match up it was so annoying I suggest not getting the app there's other options and if you do DONT get pro
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a really good editing software. Don't get me wrong. I use it all the time, but there's just one problem with template creators. You see, I don't want to make money off of it. I just want to do it for fun. Please make an option for that to turn it off."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app 100% recommend everything is free as far as I know the only problem is I can't figure out how to post sooo if you could tell me that would be great Also why is it soo hard to get the song you want on capcut I have been trying to get the 10 second song crandles by sub urban for an hour and it keeps coming up with the one that's the minutes and has not God damh singing I wanna cry please fix this
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One star because like a comment I read they are putting the basic stuff into pro to make you buy it which not a lot of people will do so they will lose more people than gain them I'm disappointed because the things that were simple and not pros I won't be able to use anymore I don't recommend this app until they fix the problem of making the basic affects and ect pros it's just not easier to make edits if all the easy stuff that weren't pros are now becoming it.(also capcut please this problem)

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I may use an app like this once a week to maybe once a month. Having a subscription based model is a terrible move. I will buy apps and I have as expensive as $150 but I will never subscribe to an app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love the app, but now that pro was added and it being overly expensive its not worth to buy, 5.99‚Ç¨ was already much but nearly 10‚Ç¨? Hell nah, wayy too much, im not spending money on a edit App that cant even fix the Bugs there are"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the app I like that they're updating things Like the movie and TV scripts or doing short stories But the options that you have Of photos for these short stories are not very good Absolutely nothing to do with the short stories I tell But I do love how you do the narration
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I wanna give this 5. But The reason I gave 2 it's because Ive been using this for a long time.. but now it always crashes. I took time to edit then when i press it,it will stuck on ""Loading effects...0%"" Can you fix it? I cannot use it properly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's indeed a great editing app for videos So far so good. I have been using it for some months and haven't noticed any bugs. I will update this review if I find any faults.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a while now but it still has no problems! I'll give this a five star rate cuz it has no ads and everything is free! Well not everything, sometimes other effects needs PRO and the way to have PRO is money so yeah calcut is not free.. Besides all of that I've read tons of reviews and no one reviewed 5 stars.Well I think. I think capcut in other device has problems.I'm using Xperia g3313 and it has no problems on mine even tho my cp is old! But this app! It's nice tho!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is good in a variety of ways such as the features and the fast downloading with amazing templates but the lag could be fixed I checked on many devices it has the lag other than that Phenomenal App
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love this app this is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è but there is an issue whenever I apply any effect it makes the video slow and suddenly it becomes faster and gets back to normal but where I have applied the effects it becomes slow please fix it üòï
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Now I can't fix the seconds on the video effects. Also you guys made some of the most basic effects pro when they weren't before. Something new always has to happen on this app unfortunately üôÑ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I would highly recommend! But whenever I have tried to become a creator it hasn't gone through but it doesn't matter! Other than that I would highly recommend and you should definitely get this app! It's amazing for editing üòÉüòÄüòÑüòÅüòÜ

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps putting once free video and text effects behind a paywall after being free for years. If I'm goning to be forced to pay for something I never had to before then I'd rather pay for an app such as After Effects.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's being really glitchy and it keeps kicking me out of the app it's annoying it was great at first but then it started to turn worst as I used it. It also won't let me add pictures to it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bought the pro version, but the export distorted all of my clips out of sync with the audio. No fixing it and hours of time wasted."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything I try to use it on tiktok, tiktok keep sending me to the app store. I have the app already and hook up to tiktok, but everytime I have to go to app store first sometimes I lost what I want to do. Because after going to the app store you don't get what you did want, it open up to something else."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really amazing and less advertisement and I love this app,,,but the animations and effects should be a bit more smooth and update a little like the shakes should be more smooth.also rainbow ghost effect type effect and more can be added"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was alright, until i imported a 30 minute video, the app froze my videos begining and messed up my video, switched to video leap. Much better"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's good TILL you try and look for songs they ONLY have songs that are like AI GENERATED and have NO WORDS once you try to look for a song from A ACTUAL ARTIST it just gives you these random songs that sound HORRIBLE would not recommend for edits but it's okay at editing videos
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really good I use it to make videos everyday but the problem is when I do a green screen the other one moves by itself. But overall it's a good app with good quality

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ok so when I first got the app it was super fun and I loved to edit but then after a couple months it glitched and would not let me access my photos. But it would still let me but like only my screen shot photos would be there.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Say all you want but tell me the reason behind putting the fps lag to the pro effects? I don't want to drop capcut because it's the only editing app that I know how to use and you capcut itself is making it hard not to delete it, If there is something I could wish for its that, that don't take what's the only good things on your app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but it has two problems. Sometimes, it's lagging or kicking me out of the app cause of the lagging, and some songs are not there, so most of the time, I have to download them, but over all, the app is great"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would be better if the reverse tool was more efficient. It shouldn't take as long as it does to reverse a clip that's less than 1 second long.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Cat cat is a very fun app I would recommend it but it is a little bit difficult to use but apart from that it is very fun to use you can make different videos and edits I would highly recommend it go and download capcut now to have some fun

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why is capcut so laggy now? It use to run smoother. It's so damn frustrating trying to make a video when capcut suddenly becomes laggy and the audio and images become delayed. It's either my problem or the app's problem. Please fix this!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is good but you now have to play for pretty much all the good effects so it's harder to edit if you don't have capcut pro. There are other glitches I'm experiencing but they are hard to explain so I just won't say.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Whenever I add music to an edit it opens up the template page and the music never adds to the video also I tried to export video but it doesn't work as well...why is this happening??

I've used that effect since April or May and NOW i cant use it? You made fps lag pro, other stuff i use pro? Like whats the point even using this app anymore if EVERYTHING is behide pro? honestly, old capcut is better then this newer one. And dont get me started that WE non payers, who wants to try out effects HAVE to pay?! Thats just stupid."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It would usually be a five star review but honestly capcut, what the hell? You had to make the transition shake 1 and vibration flash as Pro now? I know those weren't Pro before, so why make them Pro now? I suggest you remove that, because I know a lot of people use that. To be honest, what happened to being a free editing app?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Welp i dont know why i most often see the first revews as 4 or 2 starts but, not trying to make an argue with this, this app is amazing! To all you editers out there this app is for you, trust me. Theres almost no ads at all! Its also prettu easy to learn (for me at least) but dont take mh word on how easy it is tocuse sience i learn how to usr apps pretty easy. I hope everyone has a similar experience like me."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not gonna lie, when I first installed this, it became my favorite editing app not until it got famous and literally half of the effects became pro. It came to the point that I don't want to update this app anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was great until everthing became a pro feature. I get making new features pro exclusive, but most of the video effects I've used in the past and use regularly, are now blocked behind a scammy paywall. Next you'll be saying that we have to pay to use the app for more than 5 minutes"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, don't get me wrong. But all the features that are free and actually good are suddenly free for just another few days before they're going to need to be payed and I don't get why. If you do this, it's going to make people distance from the app, instead of more engagement."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how almost everything is pro and that you literally have to pay for almost everything, capcut really use to be my go-to editing app. Now it's not, I can barely make my shakes or coloring due to the pro thing capcut is really starting to make me upset over this ""pro"" thing."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut is a very nice app. It helps incorporate my daily activities or yearly sef in just one video. I don't think anyone with phone and data does not have capcut.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be a good editing app but now it's just constant glitches. Instead of making people pay for some basic effects maybe tackle the glitchiness and crashing first.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i usually have used this app for editing since 2020, and im happy on how much the app has inprooved, but! they are making effects id usually use in my edits and making them ""pro"" i also think that the pro feature is ridiculously expensive. i could edit better using other apps which are free. make capcut free again bro."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The reason I gave it a 4 is because there's a lot of people sharing their phone numbers on this and I feel like this needs to be updated so people cannot share private information to other people an especially the fact that they are grown adults on this too it needs to be updated immediately there's a lot of people out there that made accounts that are younger than 13 I hope this works and be safe out there don't share private information

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I kinda liked this but sometimes it doesnt work, i don't even know why, and sometimes all the free stuff changed, you had to pay them. This kinda suck for myself when i made animation because i kinda can't pay for something in app. but i kinda here just for the templates"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well, its a very nice app. The editing features are fantastic. One thing though, its data absorbtion is too much. But its a great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this app a years but now im disappointed because of the update, when i try to use template the photo goes horizontal even though it's a portrait in my gallery and also the ads before saving is so annoyingüòå"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to use, with a number of impressive tools available for free. It's little surprise it's taken the TikTok and short-form video world by storm."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi this app is great but the reason why I gave it an 1 star it's because of the loading....it load so long....but I don't know if it's just my phone....or not available on my phone to load someone it doesn't work..... it would work if I delete and install it again...."""
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What happened to the auto caption option? Seems like features were taken away and I have the pro version of the app I used to love but if captions are gone that's huge letdown.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cant login because I keep getting thr error that capcut is for users 13 and older when I'm very much 31. HAHAHA. ive tried logging in through multiple different ways (tiktok, Google, facebook) and it still doesn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing appfor video editing. Didn't put 5 stars because when an update comes out, the app just doesn't open anymore and it would be helpful to have an alert for new updates upon opening the app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like capcut but it won't let me put in adio nor let me work on a video for later and it's hella frustrating. Like I try to make a vid but then kicks me out then I have to work on a new one and then that one kicks me out. FIX THIS DAM PROBLEM! ü§¨
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I rate it 1 star because 1 star for good templates on the FYP I hate this app already I edit here because of our project about vlogging and it's consis of 26 minutes and yes it's take few minutes to export and when it export I go to my gallery but no vedio on it and this is the most important thing that test my patience no vedio on my gallery but ITS FULL STORAGE HAHA are you kidding me capcut? look the quality of your speed is not good so if I we're you fix this aaaaahhhh it's make me cryüò≠üò≠
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the app and edits features but it's seriously needs to pay pro but can you just put ad watch for free. Because it would be masterpiece when I put pro edit. I don't have money to buy because my parents won't allow me to pay somthing in the phone because they call me wasting money gurl. (Bad grammar)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was the best app, but now it's aggravating. There's a constant glitch in EVERY video. It's like a weird flash of glitchy color. It needs fixed asap."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app should fix lags, when I try to do an aggressive and insane edit, it lags for some reason. There is no way to have 60 fps. I can't Just finish an edit without effects because this would give me bad and low views on TikTok."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent!! Free version is amazing. You can create thousands of videos in an easy way! Merry you can use incredible templates using your own photos .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app I really love it. The app is not slow for me and I have a pretty old phone. I love making edits so fun! My only complaint is that it takes quite a while to download, but whatever."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is majesticly amazing to use and has a huge amount of different edits, themes, and transitions, templates ECT... Download this now, it's AMAZING!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a realy fun and easy app to use once you get the move on if you want a easy editing app this is the one for you (edit) since the whole pro thing came out most of the thing is used I can't anymore still a great app though
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So basically you need capcut pro for most of the editing stuff and it's quite expensive üòî AND you need capcut pro just to save your edit if you don't have capcut pro and use pro editing stuff. And there's almost no non capcut pro stuff so basically it's a waste of your own time. I hope this makes sense.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a good editing app but the only thing I don't like about it is how they added pro, I think it's stupid and not even necessary but other than that I think it's easy to use and has plenty of different options, I just wish it didn't have pro."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the heck?! Getting the auto captions wrong, not finishing transcribing the captions, and the app glitching in between... Is this some type of joke?! This app used to work better now I have to find an alternative because the developers got too lazy I guess..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very high recommended and good satisfied for us and especially the bloggers with easy to used the features and also these aps was good updates,more upgrade information and of course all you want changes edits like sound and more and effects the colors are have it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It isn't too bad accept when I open the text and click on glow it lags. But other than that it's good for making videos to post on yt :>
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut has learnt me a lot about editing and stuff can get a bit laggy though but it is very good for editors that want to do YouTube and tiktok edits was lots of aspects and filters for some people editing is not fun for me it is amazing
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Capcut is good.Got every potential for editing vid but the matter sucks and I hate is it lags sooooo....... much it's laggy at it's peak I can't even edit properly it literally lags when I just start editing.And if somehow I end up editing while exporting even 480p it after 99% says capcut is unfortunately stopped which sucks so plz fix it and I am giving it 5 stars after that for now 1 is better you deserve it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Buggy. It keeps telling me that I can't download files from the cloud because I don't have the latest version installed when I do, in fact, have the latest version installed. Very annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this app for all my edits, I have used it for more than 2 years now. Please get rid of capcut pro, I think it's unfair for others to be limited to stuff that used to be free but now isn't. This prices for it are also ridiculous for a mobile app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be a great editing app if they didn't include pro, I have to do everything hand made as there is a pay wall for the simplest things. Also gets wayyy to leggy after like 2 overlays. Look for some other apps instead"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app was working fine but some few days now I'm trying to edit my video it works fine but suddenly it stucks in one frame and does not works I use to edit so many edits on this app but plzz fix this issue I'm having many problems

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There are bugs that need to be fixed in this app. One in particular would be that the other free effects and animations would not work.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont know why my capcut is not running on internet connection after tiktok banned in my country nepal. And how it is related to tiktok, if tiktok was banned in my country why this app isn't working using internet connection it says only no internet connection even my connection is ok. Its a video editing app why it is not working please fix this issue.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so damn frustrating.. for the whole day now I've tried making new projects and stuff, Everytime I insert an audio or photo the whole app crashes. This is bs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Me personally, I think cap cut is awesome except for the fact where the sounds are locked. That just annoys me because I don't know how to unlock them. Look for stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Would recommend! This is a pretty good app for any type of videos you want to make but sometimes it's glitchy but still a pretty good app to use scince you want to add captions and the quality is so good! Would recommend! ‚ú®‚ú®
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mean, it's a great app, I always use it, but now it doesn't rlly work anymore, the keyframe doesn't work for me and when I try to add an animation it doesn't let me lower the animation thing anymore, but I still use it everyday, it's pretty good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut sm, but when I click a slowmo template it lags ;-;, I hope this will get fixed right away. Overall capcut is a good app for editing! :))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Get anything but this. Capcut sucks. It makes you pay for pro and all pro does is give you basic features any other app would have for free. It's also hard to use and the video quality always and I mean ALWAYS sucks.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a work in progress. Perhaps it's because I use an android, but the glitches in playback during editing mess up my work sometimes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The free effects became pro effects? Are you kidding me CapCut? Now half of the effects are now pro, this now app totally sucks at all! I've been using this for months but stopped when the effects became pro. This is frustrating. Stupid app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It would be a 5 star if it didn't make 80% of things on there are pro, like I can't even use my favorite fonts and transitions anymore? Everything has to be free, so we creators could enjoy our time in their platform!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be the best but since the recent update it's meh! Lots of lags, can't even find some useful features like the HD upscaler. It was a 5 now it's just a 3.üòï"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although it's good but, it just bother me because whenever I edit my video it load so slow. I don't know, but maybe the app can't really handle 1080p above video?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Over all its a great app for editing on mobile. But we need a layer option for text. And the chroma key needs some improvements too.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,when i edit my video on the app everything is good and when I save it and want to post on tiktok everything is a mess and things that I made slow or fast are not like that on capcut. literally so bad.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps sending me notifications despite me constantly turning them off. And they're not even relevant notifications either ""See what people are doing"" type of BS."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It works good but when I do animations and the clip is too small it won't let me resize the seconds and it never use to do it. Fix this please capcut
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to use this app until now. It worked great on my s21 ultra and e en the s23 ultra I had for a month. Now, I record with the same settings on my s24 ultra, and no matter what, the app tries to compress EVERYTHING! Done with this app, back to Youcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent app, but never let's me do stuff and keep disconnecting me from my own internet. Tried updating it but still, same thing. Please fix this. I use capcut to make videos and I wanna start making high quality videos for my fans."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its nice and quickly to make the videos i want...keep more making templates for us...
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yeah it's cool and all,really good for simple edits,the best effects and things we all need they are making it so you need to pay,plus if you use way too many effects to make the quality better it will get downgraded even after you export it in the highest definition settings. Do not make all the things in the app pro it ruins the app so bad"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Rially it's very useful and easy video editing app I am very happy to use this it's doing all very fast ‚è©
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At first it was a very good editing app! But then almost every good effect, filter, everything good became Pro."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good Editing App, but if you mistakenly use something for CapCut Pro, please make it easier to get rid of that feature off of the project, as it takes awhile to look through the video to find what is Pro."

Overlays suddenly won't appear (even after exporting), voiceover/music is sometimes late or early to what it should be. I used this for making a video for a school project, and I think I won't be using it again for the same purpose. Thank you so much for making this app free though :) Hope you could fix it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As much as I've used capcut, I haven't had many problems, every now and then it has s few problems but it's fine. It's very easy to learn and use and feels like I'm not any sort of trouble. One good thing is that they haven't really made too many features premium, they have done some but not a lot. Definitely the best mobile video editing software."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love this app so much 4 editing videos it kinda glitches now and a again
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good for basic editing, but whenever I try to apply smooth slow motion or motion blur or any other feature like that, it either gets stuck at 0 (I wait for around 30 minutes and still does nothing) or gets stuck at 20. Not very impressed since I'd like to do more with my editing."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app! But it needs to improve it's slow motion and background removing system! I hope it's developers will solve this issue. Ohh, there is a big problem also, when I take a slow-motion video to capcut for editing the slow-motion video, then I found that video normal, not slo-mo! But when I see that video out from capcut, then I found that video in slo-mo! I think it is a mega problem of capcut! Please fix this problem!üòí"

If you make it so every1 can see it,theyre steal it,(not tell you),(not ask you to use it,and not give you money),(every1 elses copyright matters for the app.,but they dont care about you.),then their use your stuff for commercials and stuff.the blackmirror episode joun is awful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Cap cut is the best but I have some challenges sometimes the app seems to lag especially when selecting the video or picture u want to edit and also during the additional of effect and u bring too much update frequently
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm new to Capcut and I'm really liking it alot so far but I keep having a problem when editing videos and touching the picture to bring up the ""Style"" feature for the effects like 3D and such but sometimes it only shows 3 and they're all blacked out instead of showing the regular options with all of the effects. Why does this keeps happening even after I remove the app and re-download it?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app. I use it all the time, and I think without this app, tik tok would be dead by now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yeah you can do cool edits with it but, the amount of new cool effects premium user's gets is insane. Nothing actually ""new"" and good goes to non premium user's, at least be able to watch ads to use all premium effects while doing an edit. Other thing that bothers me is the delay I get while editing my thing, can't do a synced edit cuz the app just delay everything, can't never get it right and sucks for my edits."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Caput I am starting to think that this app is horrible because you're making more money a problem by just using effects but we only want to edit for fun and pls stop making pro effects so that we can pay them because not everyone has money and plus this app is having more problems and more upgrades and it's annoying pls make this app better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I am not able to see the features of filmstrip and split in mask icon . I hope you will resolve it soon and will give some more advanced features for editing üôÇ

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you download this sometimes the app doesn't respond which Is bullsh√Øt bc when I use my Samsung fro editing the capcut works but on the infinix it doesn't work
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really solid editor with a lot of features for free and possibilities in editing. Very useful and easy to use. I only have a couple complaints about the UI: Sometimes the grid snap when moving things around (like audio or text) can be quite frustrating and hard to deal with when you're trying to get it just right. Also, on some occasions the preview will bug out, and freeze when you scroll through the video making it temporarily unplayable, thus preventing you from being able to edit further."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doubt they listen to any feedback but this app has gotten WORSE with every attempt to use it for basically anything. No, I don't care about what templates are trending! No, I don't want to add stickers to my project. No, I don't wanna try Pro but I might as well since you've LOCKED ALL the good effects and transitions (that were free before) behind your stupid paywall. NO, I don't wanna compress my 1080p clips, you should automatically support 1080p 60fps without having to compromise my quality!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive made over 115 capcuts and some are awesome. All my friends love the app sometimes and it's even almost like tiktok because you can watch other people's videos too, but there is a problem when I try to add word text or something like that it starts to get so glitchy, or when if I see someone else video and I like it and do the same thing it's like the song goes the right way but when I add my pictures it starts moving slow which I hate"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely awesome, I've been using the app since I first discovered it on tiktok, It gives more creative freedom than any other editing app I've tried I would and do happily and proudly recommend it to everyone that loves to edit video, But let's not forget all the amazing templates to make photos into beautiful videos for social media, and even for business cards, Xmas cards... And almost everything else. The auto cut for video background is unsurpassed by any app/program I've ever used"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Free, easy to use, and love it. One problem that I been having is that the app crashes on me after the update. I was in the middle of doing a video that took me a very long time. I was still editing the video, and was nearly finished but the app would always shut down my video. I couldn't even get to finished our upload it. I'm very distressed that my video of hard work won't even be upload. I hope you fixed this soon. For now, I'm deleting this and will come back when the issues is fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to work okay. It's now laggy. There's an audio delay when I export videos. My phone runs other apps just fine.

It keeps doing it even if I have already turned off all of the animations and made them all back to default ANDIT STILL COULDNT!!! Please fix this problem right away cause this is a good app but the only problem is this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, it really is. It's easy to use, and not to complicated to navigate, but a major problem I have with it is that if I add a vidoe or image to an edit, if I delete the video or image from my camera roll, then it will get removed from the edit itself. It's a real pain, especially when I need to clear storage, but i dont wanna lose good material. If yall could find a way to fix that, I'd gladly give the app a 5 star, but that little ick is just so hard to get around."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great one of or maybe the best editing app. It has so many futures and it is soooooo easy to use
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Capcut app is an excellent one. But if your team can introduce importing of 3d object and animate the to the real world it will be much better
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's really amazing but I don't really know how to edit but it's ok because you can use template

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love the application, although there's one thing that I hate the most on the application, It's really laggy when you put too much photos and/or videos and it will cause some of the photos black. When I use some effects, they kept glitching while I'm editing something. Overall, the app is the best, I just need the bugs to be fixed because they are really annoying now. Thank you!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is very good and you can do a bunch of amazing stuff on it. But my issues have been that, when you do your own editing it is quite glitchy and slow throughout the transitions. Also, some of the videos I have done/made, the lyrics and the actual words the singers are saying, are going a completely different speed to each other. But all in all very good app, highly recommend! üòÅüíï"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i genuinely love this app and have been using it since 2018-2019. it has good effects, and i make good edits on it. however, i rated this app 3 stars because the ""smooth"" slow motion is hardly smooth. it is very choppy, and sometimes it looks like it wasn't even applied. i also hate the fact that whenever i try to export a video (even less than 30 seconds), it will crash."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi! I had a good time using Capcut and I really love it. I highly recommend this app for editing video projects, dance/song covers & etc. However, I am experiencing lag issues lately which makes it hard to edit especially when making transitions. It makes me so sad that I cannot do something to prevent this from happening:""( So pleaseee I'm begging y'all to fix this so we can edit peacefully and with ease. Your efforts will be very much appreciated!‚ô°"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really love this app because it's so easy to edit things and in the end they look really good. Two problems that I have are 1. When you edit a video for a longer time it starts getting laggy and the beats you add to the video don't match the sound anymore and 2. I can't open the app for some reason I tried reseting my phone and it still didn't work. Please fix the issues.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a very nice app but I have a problem with the ""motion blur"" thing, like it just fades... kindly fix it, I really really want to try the feature. It's been months since I have the feature but when I tried using it, it just fades so I waited days, weeks, and months but still...it didn't change, it still fadesü•π so, please fix it. Thank you!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app isn't really that great to be honest. I mean it's only made for edits and short videos. But if you want to make a video that's 10 minutes or longer. That's too bad because it'll stay stuck at 99% and not go up any further. I made a gaming video that took hours to edit and was 20 minutes. It was stuck at 99% i shrunk it down to 19 to 18 minutes. Still stayed stuck at 99% it was frustrating and annoying. So i stopped using capcut and in search for a better editing app than capcut.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app but I had a problem with the combo animation. All of a sudden it won't let me choose an animation from that category. When I press ""combo"" it stays on ""in"" or ""out"" (depending on witch one I was on last. I didn't have any animation on before it neither. I deleted & downloaded it again and it still won't work. It frustrates me because I mainly use combo animations."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is really good and is easy for first time editors and people could make videos really creative. I love all the animations and easy features. Some problems I've been having however has to do with exporting. Sometimes when I'm exporting it adds 2-4 seconds extra even though it's not supposed to be there And recently when I've been trying to export my edits it makes the finish product really glitchy. Also the cover text glitches with the text in actual video text. Still recommend though!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"(20/4/22) Edit: So the quality thing was fixed, which I'm very happy about. But, there are also some problems with exporting/editing the videos. I'm trying to edit a video that's 6 minutes long, not very hard, right? Except, I'm trying to go onto the video to edit it and the video is sticking and rebooting capcut. Sorry, but as it's been happening for weeks I'm taking away a star because I'm getting fed up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would like some features to be added. Motion tracking and overlays and text to stick to the main footage (for transitions). A way to control speed for key frames. Directional blur and a way to make the keyframes look smoother. More jiggle, wiggle, and shake animations. (Softer version of shake animation) and lastly, a way to add ur own fonts. Great app overall. Please take this into consideration."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've always used CapCut as my primary editing software. I didn't have many issues with it before up until recently. Every time I use multiple keyframes in one draft, it lags the app out and makes the draft unbearably inaccessible. Every time I enter the project with the keyframes, I keep being pushed out of the app. Even processing doesn't work, and whenever it does, the output isn't as good as the preview BEFORE the lagging. I need this issue fixed because I don't think I can use this anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is good and all I can edit some but the motion blur and the smooth slow mo won't function i tried reaching out to the customer service but they didn't send me any email or something. If they would fix the problem with the motion blur and the smooth slow mo function I would give this app a 5 star. Please fix it as soon as possible or send me an email. I think it's only my device that is experiencing this kind of problem. Thank you!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using CapCut for about 2 years for editing and it was the best video editor I've ever had. Everything was free and it was easy to use, but I believe the more popular something is, the more expensive it'll get. The PRO version makes it hard to search for effects/transitions without having anything PRO related in the way and the app has been glitchy since it was introduced. Placing transitions has been a glitchy mess and this is the second time it's happened."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please remove that ""auto center"" when we want to move our video, its so frustrating and also the quality of the video when we want to export it just like trash (sorry, but it's true) even the stickers are blurry, the only one that I think in 1080p is the text, and that is never enough to make a good video. I also used free Chinese video editor before this, and that awesome (because the quality + without ""auto center"") but then it's not free anymore üò™, overall I love capcut,Thanks for reading"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an easy to use, free editing app. It's especially good for beginners. And I love the different templates you can use. Although I don't very well like the new premium. I've used capcut for about three years now, things have started running a little differently, but I guess that's okay. Maybe if less things required a premium account, the app would be a little closer to perfect. One more thing! Ads, the ads are insane, every time I export, theres an ad. So please fix that. Thank you!"

Please fix this, immediately. Thank you."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"such an amazing && easy app to use. you can do literally anything on capcut. you can even edit just like after effects and people would be shocked! though, I gave it a 4 because when you add adjustments, effects, etc. your video becomes glitchy and off beat with the sound unless you export it in its final state. and sometimes, the graphs and keyframes on my clips don't work properly when I try to do twixtor and velocity."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When it works it works great. Recently I've had it not connect to the internet, even though I have a clear connection, preventing me from being able to use screen overlays. Now, the greenscreen feature has gone missing. I've looked up of is a pro feature, but not one video or website states that's its a pro feature, so I just have to assume it's gone now? Moving on to the next app. Capcut was great while it worked, but I got work to do. CS/Feedback is useless."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I been having this app for two years now and everytime I make a video and wait a couple months or couple weeks and then go back and look at it some the picture that use just shows up as a black screen and it says something about capcut did something or something close to that. And that is very annoying bc I have to redo the video every time. But overall the app is great and is better than the other editing apps.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a really good editing tool, it's my go to editing app for my videos! It's free and you can import your edit to many places of your choice. It works on both my phone and iPad. 8/10 would recommend! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è The only bad thing is that it's kind of unorganized and things are kind of all over the place. But everything else is generally great! üëçüòå I just don't like the new ""PRO"" update (it makes it harder to find actually good effects).üò•"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoyed this app for a bit just because it was fun to mess with the 3d zoom, and I liked that you could do a lot of things (ie transitions, effects, graphs for transitions, keyframing, etc) on one app for free. however, I feel like with the removal of the 3d zoom plus other things that other users have used has caused the number of users to go down :/ especially those who only wanted to use the 3d zoom, now they have no point in keeping the app. pls bring it back"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey everyone! So I've had capcut for two months now and I have to say that I'm very pleased with the features it has, it makes editing super fun. I just really wanna see the app evolve even more, it would be amazing if graphs were added in this app, it's going to make the app even more interesting and fun to use. Plus more people will download as it's an easy to use app, that if it has graphs it's going to change the whole editing game. The presets are still so important and I use them ofc!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not the worst editing app and if you need a small phone app to edit short videos that it's great but I've seen better editing apps. On the positive side it's pretty user friendly, and it has a lot of effects for general video editing, though if you want a more complicated video, this editing app is harder to work with though not impossible to accomplish what you want."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for so long and it was really great. The only thing that bothers me/(most users) is the blue line that makes everything get in the center, it's really really annoying tho, maybe add an option where we can turn it off. And also whenever I added an overlay then click play it always getting lag and I think it's from the latest update, hope you can fix it.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I tried to download it and it keeps saying it can't download, I've tried to delete some apps to free storage but it still doesn't work. I did have capcut on my old phone and it was really good and easy to make videos! Definitely recommend but sometimes there is some bugs on the app. Sometimes it can get really laggy because if you add lots of pictures then capcut goes laggy and it's super hard to edit. But, once you export your video the video won't be laggy anymore. Hope this helps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app, great to take your ideas while on the go and quickly make a video out of it. 3/5 bacause while everything about this app is great, the music search function is absolutely atrocious.

The in-app file explorer's search function doesn't work at all, and the songs it can find aren't sorted in any meaningful way (alphabetical or otherwise). Such an integral function should just work, bringing my rating down by 2 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I came here to say that Capcut is now usable in my phone. At first, it lags too much when using internet connection while editing, but now, it does not already. One issue I've found is that putting subtitles really frustrates me. You have to double click and do that again and again to adjust the length of the subtitles added. I just hope Capcut can also fix this issue. I now decided to use it on my filmmaking journey. Thank you again, Capcut dev team üíö"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Capcut, but ever since they added Pro, it's so much harder to use. There are a lot of bugs, and when I try to fade in and out on words, it's harder. When I add keyframes to the text and some of the words' opacity is 0 and I move the text, the opacity for all the words goes to 100. The new update on the text editing is bad and I wish it would go back to how it was, it makes editing so much harder. It's annoying, and I can't use the app anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's so easy to use, and everything is free. It does get laggy when I have multiple layers and I can't use certain transitions/effects because it'll crash, but I'm pretty sure that's just my phone. This app really doesn't take up much space either, it's definitly worth downloading. I've made a lot of amazing edits on here."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for 2 months and I find it so easy to edit my videos. I like the templates, I like how easy to make things according to my like. So decided to subscribe for 1 month, the pro Subscription. For only a week of using it,things went wrong. It keeps on crashing. I check if there's an update but my version is up to date. And some of text effect like bubbles, title, and etc is not functioning. I don't know why now it is happening. And I don't know what to do to fix this.üò£"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is overall good. Simple to use, good effects and transitions and is begginer-friendly. The only issue I had with the app is the bugs. As of now, there's this one bug that makes the videos I edit blurry in some parts. It's kinda annoying and I just can't upload any of my edits to my stories as the video quality always gets ruined by the app. Hope you fix it, thank you!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What I liked about this app is, you can freely remove the watermark when you're done to finish your own edited videos on it if it's feels like annoying to you. Plus, this is so pretty easy to use. This is a good app. But my one main problem on this, is like, when you took so long to edit your video, it's starting to hard to adjust everything. And sometimes it goes into crash. That's what I really hate about. Please fix the bugs and I wish for more improvements on this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sorry for a 1 star review, but I don't really like this app. I installed it to make a YouTube video like other people. I used a black background and put video overlay. I clicked the triangle play button to play the video. Audio was synced with video. I exported it. I then went to power director to finish editing the video, I dragged the video and then noticed. THE CAPCUT VIDEO AUDIO WASN'T EVEN SYNCED WITH THE VIDEO ANYMORE. An audio came earlier than it was supposed to. This would be a good app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good editor, but struggles. i use it to make speedpaints of my art, nothing super complicated. however, i've ran into issues when trying to export my videos. boots me to the homescreen of TT immediately and gives the usual prompt as if i had saved the TT as a draft, but it's not there. this happened multiple times and eventually i just exported it to an email to work around it. it also stopped letting me do transitions suddenly. i think the issue is when having many text strings in one video?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing editing app I've done loads of edits and videos with this app it's amazing and I love all the choices!Quality is amazing, there are many choices and variety of animations,styles,text/fonts,coloring,filters,ect. It's a very easy app to manage and it takes less than 30 seconds to export a video. Unless it's a long video. I love the updates and expect more! Thank you for creating this editing app where all can join and have fun. I hope to see more soon thank you and bye! ü§çü§çü§ç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Powerful free editor. You have a lot of functionality. Still, there are some improvements that I would find them useful. - sometimes exported the videos has glitches. The only solution is to create again the project. - font/animation position is changing from time to time or from version to version making annoying to search what you want in a list of 100+ items. - have a search functionality for font, animation, transition, etc. - search functionality for gif/sticker on giphy or other websites"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Theres a new graphing feature! So far it works well. But I wish there's motion blur,tracking blur etc. It helps making transitions smooth bc rn, transitions are pretty choppy, even your presets. it could really improve your app. overall tho, it's a decent app. its good for editing vlogs but not sure if its best for making edits. This app has really improved since it first launched. My major problem w it is that if you export it in the highest quality, theres glitches shown in the vid. pls fix!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this app for making edits. Most if the edits I make require velocity, and reverse. Whenever I try to press reverse, or use the features in ""style"", it takes an extremely long time to load, almost 20 minutes, and sometimes it doesn't even let me have the effect in my video after it gets generated to 99%. Please fix this! It used to work perfectly fine and now it's acting like this. Before this was happening, my review would have been a five üôÅ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Literally my favorite editing app ever! I have tried so many & this has been the best. BUT I wish they wouldn't have taken the overlay drag away, before you could drag it to the side of the screen and it would quickly move, now you have to move it little by little. **Also, some things they should think about adding that I wouldn't mind paying for: -simple drawing on the screen - an auto silence cropping feature (to crop out pauses/parts without sounds) no mobile app does this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rated 1 star hoping you guys actually read the low scores. First off, the app is great. Thank you for creating a free mobile editing app. And finally, the auto-snapping feature is the bane of my existence. I can not, for the life of me, precisely position anything anywhere I want it to without it clicking onto the sides or the x and y axis. So, please please please, add a toggle for the auto-magnet feature."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been dying to find a great app like videostar because my phone is android. My friend recommended me this app yesterday and I was not supposed to download it because I thought it was just like the other appd that contain paid effects and all. I was really amazed when I first used it! It's such a great app. Sometimes, it lags when you use effects but just exit your project(it automatically saves) then clean your phone. When you go back to the project, the effect will be on it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, it has good presets and premade transitions that you can mix up to create a new one, but there's a reason why I only rated it 4 stars. The keyframes don't work whenever you're trying to make movement for a picture/text that doesn't have graphs, and I've been having that problem whenever I'm editing. I think that's the only issue for me though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use mainly for my Youtube Channel, and the video compression is a little annoying because the vast majority of my videos are recorded in 720p but forces over half of them to be 1080p which makes the storage skyrocket, and i don't really have enough storage. The export tends to say ""not enough storage"" when i have a gig in storage or close to a gig in storage space available. If you can, make the video compression only work for videos 1080p and not require 720p videos to be compressed. Thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"BEST app I've tried! Many interesting features and effects, very easy to use. No ads - a huge plus! ‚ù§Ô∏è A few issues: Sometimes there are teeny tiny delays when working on bigger projects, and when playing the edited video, the beginning sometimes freezes (the audio plays normally, and the video catches up after a moment). In one project, when I opened it later, all the filter bars disappeared (i couldn't edit the filters i had applied, and I noticed they'd misaligned.) But overall, great app üëç"

It would only show 3 or 4 of them. AND this is the most annoying part, everytime literally EVERYTIME I would make a new edit, it would make it like 30 minutes long. I tried to stop it but it wouldn't let me. I even deleted the game and downloaded it again but it still didn't work . Please fix this. I miss the old game."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I give this a 3-star. It kept lagging and it's annoying. Only 2 overlays added and it already lags. Also, when i export the videos i made, i can't play the video, but the audio only, it's really annoying to the fact that you wasted a long time waiting. (if your video is long) It says that the video codec is not supported in my gallery, but i could send the video in other apps though, but still fix it. Overall, good preset transitions and nice settings. Almost perfect app, just need to fix lags."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app.Every aspect about it.It allows u to choose videos/photos from specific folders from your phone,u don't need to search for them individually.It allows you set a very short duration for photos so you can easily create stop motions. It has the coolest effects, transitions, sounds, overlays, so diverse that even after a year of using it i still never needed to download anything elsewhere. It doesn't leave a watermark. Shame i can't fit in more text here, this was a THANK YOU note ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut. It's easy to use, and unlike most editors a lot of features are available for free. But... When I try to use it on my phone, it lags like crazy. It works perfectly fine on my iPad! Maybe this is an android issue, but I'd appreciate insight on what I can do. Also, I have wayyyy more storage available then on my iPad, and I cleared cache, it isn't helping the issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE THIS APP! it was hard to find an editing app with good transitions. honestly the transitions aren't too good, but the animations are! you an use them instead of the actual reset transitions. IDEAS: please add a function to make your own transitions! if that's not possible, please add more transitions options like shake and stuff! overlaying 2 effects on top of eachother should be a thing too. overall best editing app I've ever tried."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I already rate this app a couple of months had passed already, and now I will edit my review because capcut is getting sucks. When u add transitions in your videos, it will lag, so much lag. I can't even edit without getting annoyed about it. And second, when u already export the video and after I watched it, there's a long black screen that will be added to your video, what is happening? My original video was only 16 seconds and it became 24 seconds because of the black screen after the video."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"best editing app, and it's completely free! there are a lot of features! we can also remove the watermark by simply deleting it! so it's very amazing. But the problem is.. it lags a lot and the song won't match the video sometimes.. I dropped this to a 2 star because of how much it errors. When i'm editing and want to click 'play video button', it freezes, no matter how many times I click it I can't play the vid, the button is at pause all the time"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for editing your videos! You can choose how long you want pictures, or videos to appear in the video, you can add cool affects, text, sounds, and other stuff!

I like that you can add photos in your videos while editing, upload/share directly to any social media platform. I feel like the music selection could be better. There are no adsüôåüèæ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is phenomenal. It's the best editing app out there. However I have some suggestions. If you could please add custom fonts? (Fonts that we can download and use them here), also add a motion blur effect (that would be cool) and last of all a better exporting. I'm not saying that the exporting is bad. I'm just saying to improve it ;) That's all!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new text update is bad. Now I have to individually edit the text one by one to look the same and its exhausting. Before the app would copy the 'style'(font, color, effect, animation) of the last added text and that made editing a lot less of a hassle. I like CapCut to edit, but this isn't it. Also the audio is always laggy and ruins my edits. Sat 5 hours on one and when I came back everything was out of place. I just exported another project and the audio was off again, so now it's useless."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app although I do not know whether it's my WiFi connection or the actual app, there is a random lag when I am trying to play my video, the sound is perfectly fine but the video lags and is very slow. Moving that aside, I recommend the app to those who want a good but simple editing app. I am very happy and this is a 10/10 from me not including the problem I had listed above. Please try it, its really good <3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good app. Great features and easy to use I am having a problem at the moment with exporting a video. I did it once and couldn't find it so I thought it must have not worked.. then I exported the video again and it did the same thing. However it is now taking up 8gb of my storage space and maxed out my memory. I can't find the files anywhere.

No ads, No logo on the side even though there is one at the end but we can remove it, good transitions, new effects and stickers, etc. I'm using this app to edit my videos for my YouTube channel and I really love it. I can even do tiktok edits with this. Made me uninstall powerdirector. Amazing just amazing üëèüèº üëèüèº"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app as it is really handy to use as well as the organization of the menus. But it is really lag right now, and it's annoying, it's hard to edit and I just uninstalled it. I can't finish with my project because it keeps on lagging and even making some parts of the video green. I hope you can find solution for this. This is my favorite editing app, so imma be happy if you solve this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this editor and I use it for everything I make BUT there used to be a feature that allowed you to adjust the effects you applied to your video. And that has disappeared with the last update?? I'm not sure if it's a bug or if they removed the feature. The adjust button is greyed out for all of the effects. Either way it really sucks and kind of completely hinders my ability to use the app for my stuff.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, it's very easy to use for effects and such. But could you please make a sort by or search bar button when we're about to import an audio coming from our device? Because it's difficult to import music especially if we have lots of audios on our device. The list is rumbled and it's difficult to find the song we are about to import, it's not even sort atleast in name, i'm having a hard time in that part. Hope you consider this. üò£"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm absolutely disappointed. The new update made the app so unbearable! When I crop my video, the uncropped one is still behind the cropped one. Sometimes if I move something like a text, it would duplicate thousands of the same text. This problem also works with cropped videos, texts! Also, the motion option? The thing makes the video a whole lighter color than the actual video, also, it's extremely laggy. Capcut, I am so disgusted."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a decent app but it has a lot of button that you can mess up your editing with which isn't a big problem if you have been using it for a while and got used to the layout, like me. But the biggest thing that brought the stars down was how it did not work. At all. As soon as I went into my capcut and did a new project, everything was blank and I couldn't play the video, add stuff, do transitions, or export. So, I had to reinstall and lose all of my drafts, some of which were not saved. Fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is such a useful app! its simple and you can make some pretty interesting things with it! i'm very impressed with the design but i have one problem.. on the new motion blur update it's messed up for me. everytime i try to do it, it always comes out very laggy and buggy. i really wanna do motion blur for my edits so i hope this gets fixed in future updates! other than that this app is amazing and perfect for beginners!! <3"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is a great one it has many features and lots more but once in a while I will do this ting where if you put an audio in a certain area and leave it and click it again it with should the audio in a different area this makes me really confused. Another thing is sometimes I will put a picture for 0.3 or 0.4 second and it will put it to 0.1 seconds automatically and when I try putting it back the picture turns black. This app is a really good one but please fix the bugs thank you!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"What's not to say about this app? It does SO MUCH MORE than you might think for it being a free app. I love everything you can do. You can add sound effects, music, animated text, transitions, insane effects, the list goes on. Did I mention it's FREE with NO MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED TO ACCESS A LITERAL S&#T TON OF FEATURES? Hands down the best video editor I've used. This is my new video editor for my YouTube channels. Don't get ANY other editor than this. You'll be more than just impressed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is so easy to use. The layout is simple and uses clearly labelled shortcuts to do certain things. It takes time to get used to it having used a similar app ""inshot"" before. They have a variety of templates made by others or you can make something entirely new. I would love to see more diversity when it comes to posting templates. As I am a student I can not afford to buy premium but I would love to be able to post my creations. Overall awesome editing software I would highly reccomend.10‚≠ê"

Everytime I input a picture it adds more pictures and glitches the whole screen out. This also includes the text, overlay, graphs, etc. It really pisses me off when I try to make an edit it just glitches my whole edit and ruins it. When I exit the app and go again, it's still not fixed. It's just completely buggy and I have no idea why. Please fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The apo is great, and the transitions are beautiful! Extremely intuituve and easy to use. However, the audio constantly slowly starts desyncing from the audio file during editing, so I have to keep on saving the project to look at the timing then try and edit said timing while getting no feedback, leaving the smallest of changes needing another export of the video. If that lil audio issue gets fixed, it'd be practically perfect! The issue is just so annoying and disruptive that it docked 2 stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've tried every video editing app that my device can support and this is THE best one. I feel like this app can do just about everything - overlays, effects, transitions, filters, key frames, masking - you name it - with a simple, easy to use interface. The only things I would love see is more support for slowmo editing as there are no android apps that can really interpolate frames to make slow motion smooth (ios has Videostar for this). With that addition, this app would be flawless to me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a 5 stars.. but I have some issues with it.. Everytime I try to use a effect for my video it will sometimes not work and just freeze the app. Also everytime I'm making a video sometimes the song just starts to not match with the screenshot. Like I replay it, everything fine. But then I wanna add a effect when it lags me out. It starts to be werid and the music starts to not work... I hope you can fix this bug."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app overall, but maybe for new update, you can make 2 animations or more animations in one clip. I feel like I'll be really helpful for a lot of people instead of saving it, then cutting it and all that stuff. Also, you should make a category for like graphics and stuff. Like you can make one category 4 regular cap cut; and then another category for graphic transitions cap cut. I really love this app. But those are just some ideas thank you :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Unlike other apps, all the effects and tools in CapCut are free, so editing is no problem. Music is also free, which is also very helpful and useful. One slight problem is that somtimes CapCut lags which is really annoying when your trying to make a video. Other then that, I highly reccommend this app to all who like to use good editing apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a great app. However there are some bugs. 1. Sometimes in autocut it will randomly change one of my images to a image i used before 2. It dosn't have a vast category of songs sometimes there are songs that I have never even heard of 3. In autocut it uses the same songs over and over again i would like something new Other than that this app is great. I HIGHLY recommend
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's ok I guess. It literally won't load and effects. The only thing that works/will load is auto captions. Other than that it takes forever to load effects or animations. And some days effects and animations don't even load at all. I've tried everything even un downloading and re downloading but nothing works. It has nothing to do with WiFi or Internet because I've had this for almost 2 yrs and never had this problem. In those 2 yrs this was the most perfect video/photo editing app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, I rated this a 4-star because of a couple issues. One, it takes too long for the compressing to finish. Two, the app goes back to the edits page or crashes when I go to another app. I have a couple of requests to make too. Add more effects like Mirror (The One Side is normal but the other side is the same but inverted), Add a proper pitching scale and lastly, Add a Draw Option. Overall, the app's still great."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good and pretty simple to learn I do recommend this if it's your first time editing. But, the biggest problem I have with this app is the fact that it doesn't seem to work with my cricket phone for some reason, it heats up my phone a bit and everytime I try to export a video, it gets to at most 79 and just kicks me out to the home screen. Worse, it's having this much trouble over a video that's not even a minute-long. If you can update it to work better, I would appreciate it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is extremely good in terms of basic to average video editing. I am a very satisfied with user interface and I use it for making vlogs. However, Capcut authorities need to include the ""BUBBLES"" feature into their text animation as well. Because, right now, even when we give a particular text a definite animation, the animation does not show up on the bubble background of the text layer. I will give five Star if they change this in the next update."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app and it has really good effects but I would love to give this app 5 stars if it had these few updates: 1. If you could make your project longer than 59 seconds, I would love to use this app more often. 2. To add more animation, basically, if I wanted to add an intro and outro for a picture, you could only add 1 animation, never another."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for over a year now and it was all fine but I've noticed recently that it's starting to a little weird like when I wanna extend a clip it extends it for 30 mins (not sure u understand), when I wanna add stickers, effects, sound effects it all keeps loading no matter how stable my WiFi is and how long I wait. Pls fix ASAP bc I'm rlly used to working w capcut and I don't see myself using other apps. It would be great if you could fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was great at first I've been using it for over a year now, but recently when I make an edit and try to export it it messes up the timing. In the actual app the timing is perfect but the second I upload it it changes so that the video no longer matches the sound like how I edited it to. It is so annoying and I feel like the quality of the app just keeps deteriorating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a good editing app, it has many features and actually has decent effects and features. The only problem is the blue lines when you're adjusting pics/vids, it actually makes it more difficult to align because you can't really move it freely. I hope you can fix this feature or either remove it. And overall, this is already a good editing app but it also has rooms for improvement. :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It worked for a bit, I made some really good videos. But when I tried making a video a while ago. It just stopped all function. When I tapped on the video just loading would crash the thing. Rendering it useless. I tried deleting the video and remaking it. Just selecting the screenshots made it bug out. I tried deleting the app and downloading it again. It isn't doing anything now. By this point I'll have to find a different app to use for making videos. I think this should just stop updating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to really enjoy CapCut and found it to be one of the easiest video/photo editors I have found. I love the templates that help me express my feelings and thoughts. But for me, the downside is the newer updates. CapCut worked perfectly fine before with ease and very few problems. It was easy to navigate and export projects, but now I have trouble cropping/editing pictures for templates as well and using specific features due to unessasary changes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app but recently it has been lagging a lot. I like putting my photos to music and having them go very quickly but recently it has become impossible to watch unless I export it. Obviously this make editing impossible as it is hard to tell what clip to rearrange. But it was a great app! Please do something Captcut!!! Edit- it is much better now! Deffinetly recommend!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! This made editing so much easier than alight motion or video star! You get a bunch of transitions, filters, effects and way, way more. The edits don't look too cheap either if you edit it well. It's also super duper customizable. One thing I would like though are smoother keyframes and more keyframe options. Other than that this app is great for editing videos or making edits!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really amazing editing app!! Though, when they changed the name to ""Cap cut"", it won't let me edit or make videos anymore. I tried deleting some videos i made but it won't let me. When i press ""new project"", it doesn't show any videos or pictures. I hope i'm not the only one who experienced this :// but overall, really amazing app!! Easy app for editing and a great starter app for editors"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it is easy for doing edits though I do have 2 suggestions to make the app more better and so people may enjoy it more. 1. I would love if you can make the changing the speed better quality. 2. i would love if you could add more animations or effects like it would be cool if there was a ghost effect. Other than that it is an amazing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Literally the best app with best features, compatibility, UI, no ads and watermark. Plus all of these stuff being on an entirely free app already makes me and others thank the developers so much. There's no literal reason for using something else as an editing software on mobile. But one of the features that the app lacks is audio only exporting, such as .mp3 or .ogg files. If you would want to edit the audio only, you have to export it as a video first then convert it to an audio file manually."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for quite some time, the app was doing great! I really love the free templates sound effects and all. But today I kept experiencing bugs, like the texts just switch into other fonts, suddenly turning into small etc. so I went to play store to check if it needs to be updated but no. I checked the ratings but I can't, but in other apps I can.So I delted the app and saw the ratings now its has alot of 1 star it used to have a little amount of 1 star and had alot of 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. A lot. It's so easy to use for editing my videos. Also, I'd love to give you 5 star BUT only if you guys can fix the songs to be in order. If you can't make the search button, AT LEAST make it arranged in alphabetical order. Please. It took such a really long time just to find a suitable songs for my videos. Please considere my request. Thank You!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the application, and it's easy to use, but I want this application to be updated again, because there are still very annoying bugs when exporting and inserting videos/photos, When I export and put the vid/photo it actually comes out ..? And I want the keyframe to be smoother and the speed smoother, I hope my request is granted (Sorry if there are words that offend)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app, for some reason, when I export an edit, some of my clips are just a green screen, so that's fun. I can use an effect and then decide to take it out, and when I export it, it's as if I still have the effect there. It's really frustrating, I tried making copies and uninstalling, but it still happens. The only thing that helped was making it 480p it decreased the duration of the effect. I've come to the conclusion that you can't use 4k clips. It'll just bug out and glitch capcut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recently got the glow effect on the text and this would be my first time using it. For some reason it only exports up to 21%. I've went to other edits that are more or less the same and they all export beautifully. But this one, with the glow effect, just goes up to 20/21% (nothing more, nothing less) and sends me back to the main page. All over; I love Capcut, and just wanted to let you know of a possible glitch."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it, but I have some issues/suggestions: 1. Keypoints can't be dragged after being set. 2. Can't group objects/stickers together. 3. Whenever I add/edit/delete a sticker/text the timelines reset to the top (I reckon this is a bug). 4. Stickers/text can't be fully placed outside the workspace - unlike overlays. 5. Bluetooth audio not synced when editing videos (working fine with phone speakers)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Your app is amazing!! Please never change anything about it!(unless you want to add more effects and other stuff than I don't care) I love using it too edit and I love that there's not a stupid logo and lots of free effects and transitions! Thank you!üíï Edit: still really love the app but it keeps being super laggy when I'm trying to make stuff. Please fix that!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Capcut, Personal I love using capcut! However, I have just two issues. When I edit a video then export it, then add it in a new project the video I had just added in glitches and the app freezes up. And for the second issue, When I get a new video and add motion blur it doesn't work even if I continuously change the settings and intensity it still dosent work. Thank you for reading this Capcut! Sincerely: Capcut user"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app for editing and making videos. The reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because of the Pro things. I accidentally used a pro and couldn't get it off my 20 minute video, I had to restart (it took me 2 hours to get to that point, aka the end of it, and I had to restart all because there was a malfunction everytime I jokingly or accidentally clicked on Pro's, please fix this error. Thank you for listening."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The effects, the editing tools, all are ok except the music import part. Why there are song that i have already downloaded to my device but cannot import them to the video? They even don't appear in the ""your music"" list. I downloaded the songs so many times but still cannot find it in the above list. Hope you can examine this problem, or update the app so i can import songs from other music apps. Thank you and hope the developer can see my review!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love capcut, I keep having this issue when it comes to editing. Capcut tends to get laggy and slows down everything whenever I put effects, and I have one more problem.. is that when I want to put a new audio that I have save from tiktok, it won't show up no matter how many days it is, it just won't show. It's quite frustrating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love to use this because you can remove the watermark without paying. And it's easy to use! But I also experienced that it's lagging when you put like 3 - 4 overlay or making the pictures go fast.. and yeah.. that's all „Ö§ Edit: please fix the lag, it's really annoying when you're trying to edit something the outta nowhere your audio disappeared.. please please please fix the lag.. thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app, but it isn't ready to be Awesome. Why? Let me explain. First of all, whenever you would want to try out a new tiktok template, it would load up till 70‚ÑÖ for me. Second of all, it has to much premium effects which would want me to get premium but I think it is a monthly pay. It always asks to get premium to just use some cool effects and stop showing ads. Third of all, capcut is good but it would be better if they added new stuff every 2-3 months. Even if they were small"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can't keep using this app if all it does is lag out and screw up all the time and effort I spent editing a video each time i use it. Currently, I have been working on a video for 2 hours and the timing, and everything is completely off. Even after remaking the video multiple times, it still somehow keeps messing the timing up and lags way too hard. Frustrating as hell."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just want to say that for a free video editing app this is AMAZING!! You can do a lot on capcut that you can't do on many other video editing apps that aren't free which I love a lot! EDIT: ever since I've updated the app I always get a pop-up saying that the app hasn't been installed when it's right there on my phone, PLEASE FIX THIS I can't even enter the app from my phone at all! Edit: You still haven't fixed it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think the overall app is amazing, if I were to nitpick one thing, it would be better if the overlays attached themselves to the image or video on the main track/clip just as the text does. It gets frustrating to keep moving the overlays back to the clip you want them to be on when adding more videos or images on the main track/clip"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update: after the update. My videos seem to stutter. After I add a different clip, before the next clip starts it stops for a millisecond before playing next clip OMG! Take it from someone who's downloaded and uninstalled way too many video editor apps. This beats everything so far. Fitting images/videos to frame? Free transitions? Animating every clip? Add audio? Easily trim clips? No watermark? This has it all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's just one thing that refuse me to rate it one more star is that the audio :( While editing, the audio is smooth but once i checked it at my gallery, the audio is a bit out of tune. Can you please fix it? Thank you! Edit: after the update the problem is still the same, plus what's worst is that while editing, the vid keeps on lagging. Please fix it developer, i really love this app :')"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not many options. I would like to see more background creations for the simple things when trying to post. This is a visual based platform which is great for those who enjoy it. However, it's not my case. So it's very limited in creativity or creative ideas to post simple things to social media rather than flash things that don't match my style of creative content."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this to edit it's pretty good and gets the job done but the amount of bugs is annoying. I get that it's free but many people use this app and the fact that I cant go a week without having to reinstall, clear my data, or just search up problems/bugs I have is just too much. I'm currently reinstalling right now because a green glitch is hindering my edit and I keep having to clear data because it displays the wrong video on the track. I just want the bugs to be fixed so I can smoothly edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great! The thing is most of the sound effects got deleted and I needed them for a video. Also it kind of lags when I have internet! If you can please fix this and add the sound effects back overall it is a great app! I would've given it 5 stars but then again we go to the same thing. I would recommend this app for editing and such!üòÅ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very easy for beginners to learn how to use CapCut. It has little to no ads which is also something I like about CapCut, but the only problem I have is with the smooth slow-motion. Depending on what video you import, the smooth slow-motion will either be amazing, or it just won't work at all. I don't know if this is an issue with my phone or an issue with the app itself, but I would love for this problem to get fixed so I can continue to make edits."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a good well rounded editor, but I would prefer if it had the option to save edited and complete projects to an external storage facility, because of low-end devices. Even i on many occasions constantly worry about my storage space after each work....... Also, if it's not too much of trouble, I'd really appreciate getting an actual pc version of the app without the need for blue stacks because my pc, lags like hell when I use it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is really good and I recommend it for beginners. It's very easy to use and once you get the hang of it, you can make edits like the After effects ones. If a transition you want is not there, then you can make one using advanced transitions. Plus, it's also free! I've been using it for about 1-2 years. Anyways that's all I have to say thanks for reading. :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey Capcut! Its honestly one of the greatest apps to edit in but i just hope that you can add a feature that you can change the aspect ratio of the video mid-editing because I just find it so tedious especially when you've finished editing a video, and you change ur mind to make it have a different aspect ratio, it's just so hard to open another file to edit again. I hope the team gets to read this review."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app, however there's a problem, whenever I add audio's , and choose songs in my device, the new songs I just downloaded didn't appear in ""device sounds"" and when I try to search it at the app, it always shows the old TikTok songs, and not what I'm looking for. Please fix this, I like this app so much, and I don't want it to disappoint me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app is great, and really easy to use. but it gets laggy after adding many effects, transitions or clips and then it becomes unusable. I have to save the edit every few seconds just to see the downloaded version without any lag since the app is so laggy, and that wastes a lot of storage space and is inefficient. please fix this and also add graphs so we can make our own transitions! this app has a lot of potential and thank you for making it freeüêßüíñ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app was spectacular to use and easy to understand as well. It takes time to get started but after time to time you will get used to it. Translation options are sick and we have an option to add or remove watermark, it's stunning! I would like to suggest to add a new feature: saving your files and could export it to another decive, that way we could easily finish our project on another device when the other device aren't functioning and redoing it again. Other than that is a wholesome app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for 1-2 years and it's very good! Although there's a problem when I wanna make Gacha Videos. Theres never REAL SONGS. There's only songs that are made by real users. Anyway. Please add songs that are not just beats. Popular songs pls! Edit: Sometimes, when it's out of date and I don't notice, it crashes and it scares me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, to the point that I deleted the video editor app I used before because this is much better. Free transitions, free stickers, and the aesthetics of it that I love. The only thing is when you edit a long video, the video are gone in the layer but keeps playing in the screen and when you put some text, stickers or even an overlay- there is lag on it. There's a bug? All was good, but it keeps lagging. Hope that it may fix. I, we will be looking forward for that. Thanks a lot! ‚ô°"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for video editing but I've had multiple issues with the app. The first being that I cannot import more than 199 screenshots, if I exceed that number, it kicks me out to the main page of the app, but I can still import after I've started the project. The second issue, is when I import more screenshots to a project, the whole thing lags like crazy. It's extremely annoying and needs to be fixed. If it's fixed I may up my rating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I made an edit and exported it. When I watched the exported video, the lineup became different. What I meant is that I made the clips lineup with the beat and when I exported it, it has some sort of delay. I tried checking if I made a mistake but none. I exported like 8x but nothing worked. So I have to guess where the clip is going to land so that it will be with the beat. Took me around 2 hours. That's all, overall great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly I found thus app really nice. But as time goes it's having new features but it's degrading. The templates I am now able to use them. But now they work only with photos and not videos. It's so frustrating. It reaches 50-56 % and them does not progress further. How do I edit my videos. Please fix this. Please. It will be really helpful.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app,I have not experienced a lot of problems and I love how many font options for text we get. But I think you should add more transitions. The reason I give it four üåü is because sometimes when I try to preview my video it glitches and doesn't play the full edit. However I experienced this a lot more when I speed up my videos,but when I export it everything of fine,so can you fix that pleaseüòôGreat app,otherwise‚ù§Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it helps me edit my videos very easily without problems. Or so I thought. I, multiple times, dowloaded and deleted this app for this reason: When I export a video, import it again to edit it, some frames dont appear and are replaced with a longer version of another frame. Ex: Frame 2 and 3 do not appear and Frame 1 replaces those two. Using other apps doesn't help because it doesn't have the same editing like this app. So it's really infuriating. Might be my phone but idk."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good but also not the best. I have been using for a while, but it always crashes. Sometimes id be in the middle of a edit and it would crash. It also lags WAY TO MUCH!! If I add an effect it lags and the music and vid don't line up. So, it would be the end of the song that i used but the start of the edit. Which clearly needs to be fixed. I really want to rate it 5‚òÜ, but it has way to many errors/bugs. Pls fix this! :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, really do. Its really easy to navigate and runs smoothly. I just would love if there was a feature to customize the length of a clip, like type it out instead of dragging the slider. I needed to make some clips 0.1s but the slider was blocking so I couldn't see the numbers and I had to switch to another app. Other than that, its good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I rated it 4 stars because this is the only app that is making me easy to edit transitioned videos unlike the other video editors that needs to have the 'pro version' to unlock the other effects, special features, etc. which is making it rare for me. But the issue I have here is that everytime I apply an effect/animation to the photo, it does not load the effect I've chosen and I have to wait for a couple of minutes for it to be applied. Please fix this issue. That's all, thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this is a great app! no watermark, easy to use, and just plainly great. my only issues is when i tween, there's no option to turn off snapping, and after a while it gets really frustrating, trying to place something perfectly, but suddenly it snaps into the center of the screen. apart from that, it's really fantastic and i'd reccomend capcut to everyone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been experiencing long lags/restarting itselfs, i‚Äôve been experiencing annoying things in this app. For example, I edited a video which is for my project and I worked very hard for it I saved it and there it was, I came back and it was gone! It wasn‚Äôt even in my gallery too. It is not because of my phone, storage, wifi/network, so Devs please fix this issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this a lot, but since it's switched some things over to the Capcut Pro that had been completely free beforehand, I had stopped using it. I downloaded it again because I wanted to get back into editing, just to try to make an edit and not be able to apply smooth slow motion. It says nothing about it being a Capcut Pro only option, but the application didn't budge off of 0%. I'm trying the desktop version and if that doesn't work, I lose hope. It's sad to see what capcut has become."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app worked well for a while. I was able to edit with no problems at all, but now I'm starting to have a few problems including 1) When using text, the text doesn't go where exactly i want to put, though everywhere else is fine. 2) Syncing with the music gets worse as you cut a video more, making you think that the edited video is on beat when it isnt. 3) Keyframes are very large and restrict me from moving the screen as fast as desired. Edit: It's gotten worse. more bugs, less functionality"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app for editing my YouTube videos. It has so many great features but recently its stopped working. Everytime I try to edit something, the buttons don't work and I've restarted my phone multiple times to see if it would help but it doesn't, please fix whatever is wrong with the app. Edit: I realized I had an update, so maybe that was my problem"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can y'all please update the app for bugs? Now, whenever I save my project to my device: it flickers the video and image together despite me not using any effects. It doesn't show up while I'm editing, but the minute I save it to my device, it does that! it's very annoying and makes my projects look bad. I hope y'all can fix this bug. I didn't experience this until 3 days ago."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I personally think this is one of the best free editing app, but l do have a problem. I do not like it how when you try to move the letters and sometimes, it glitches. It's okay, though. And l do appreciate how they give you free sound affects and free screen shaking stuff, but yes, as l said, the letters glitch sometimes, so l highly recommend that you remove that glitch, hopefully see this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"[PLS NOTICE ME] This is my most favorite editing app so far! It has so many useful tools and more convenient. But I have a one big problem on this app, the lag. Whenever I add elements like transitions and stuff, it's very laggy when I try to play it. But the video is fine when it's exported. I hope you fix this kind of probs. üíñ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Definitely one of, if not the best editing apps out there, but for some reason it really struggles to allign things, any time you try to put something on 2 allignments(such as vertical and horizontal center), it refuses to connect and lags just behind it, and then skips over it, making it an extremely tedious task to put something on the center of the screen, this also happens when aligning objects with edges of the screen"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a really great app overall, the transitions,the bgs,the effects, the filters and everything is great but, please add graphs so that we won't have to work with keyframes which is a hassle for me. And secondly it laggs a lot these days. Please kindly fix these problems and add graphs. And maybe let us make our own accounts? it'll be cooler that way and we could post too! But for now please add graphs and do something about the laggs:'/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly a good app, especially for people unfamiliar with editing software (such as myself). Main issue is the compression. Whenever I try to upload a large video, it needs to be compressed, which can literally take HOURS. this is a big issue in my opinion, and really makes the experience worse. But overall, it's great and easy to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Loved it for a while then yesterday when I went to make a small video it quit working. When I would try to select the section that I wanted to edit I couldn't. Now I can't even process the video to download it. I mean for the past few months the app has gone down hill but now it's unusable. Before it was audio wouldn't sync or that text would not want to go where I wanted it but now I can do anything. So untill this issue is fixed I will be going to a different app. Thanks
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is by far the best free editing software i have ever used. It has a lot of functions and you can create awesome edits if you know how to utilize its functions. The only problem about this is its really laggy especially when you start adding lots of edits and layers. I think creating a pc version of this app would solve this problem because i dont think mobile phones are able to handle this much software. Really looking forward to a pc version of this. Thanks!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Like the app been using for quite a bit now but I have a few issues 1. I downloaded all of the stickers but It doesn't even show the face of the sticker 2. I have real good connection but It says download failed 3. I have to go all the way down so I can find the song I need 4. It lags. edit : this was 4 stars before now it's 2 why? Because of the recent update I can't use the 1. Transitions and Effects even the text. 2. The cursor doesn't move when u play.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, nothing clearly wrong about it. There's no ads and you can add audios easily without struggling. It does need internet which is pretty okay with me, I just wish that I could edit in places which are pretty far away from home. There is a bit of lagging though,everything's pretty much alright. I am loving the app although, overall it's good, nothing's wrong with it. Really reccomend downloading the app. üòÅüòÅüòÅüëç -A fellow editor"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great editing app. The best I've used. I've been using it for almost a year without problems. However the last couple of months, the app is behaving glitchy. While I'm playing preview of my edits, the pictures/videos lag or glitch so I can't tell if they're line up with the song properly. And so the only way to see it play smoothly, I have to download it every time I make a change. It also freezes sometimes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has fast export and download. It has many text fonts, effects, and is definitely easy to use. But the thing is that I have to record or use specific apps to add music. And the animation for in and out cannot be used at the same time. We still have to use loop and it's not satisfying at the end of our editing. I have a lot of editing apps to recommend but definitely way excellent then this. Hope you fix that out in the next update and maybe I would change my mind on this app. Still using."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good, the effect, the animation and the transition is free and theres so many choices. And in the audio there is an option to ""Add Beat"", which is actually very helpful when making an edit to match the beats of the audio. But there is one problem, i sync my tiktok acc to capcut, but somehow it wont let me download the audio i saved from tiktok, when i tried sharing it from tiktok itself, it said ""file is not supported"". If there is a solution, pls do tell me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best editors ever! I use this and alight to edit videos. If this app added a few more things that alight had, this would be the best app ever. For one, there is no watermark, tons of transitions, tons of styles of text, almost everything. The things that would improve the app are things like, being able to mark spots on music,so you know where the beats are, custom transitions, abd other common things on alight motion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Before using the latest update I have a feedback for you that you like to hear... Positive feedback: The graphics and everything are good and its nice. For the negative: -its laggy -the music/audio in my phone are not all here, just a few songs are available, so I cannot choose the songs that I have - and regards to audio I hope you also could have an option of adding a recorded audio that I already have in my device, even though there's an recorder here, I already have a recorded one"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall pretty good. What's really annoying is how A LOT of the filters and effects are pro. What's REALLY ANNOYING is how it lags when you try to watch the video while your editing or add more than one effect, and it never allows me to apply smooth slow motion which is a big part of my editing. Also, when you post a video with the app it has the 'capcut fantastic visual effects' or editing mad easy' which is really bothersome.Pls fix theese problems!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't have any problem in this app before, it's a great video editor app and I've been using it for awhile now. It has many useful features like stabilizer, video transitions and effects, text animation, filters, stickers, overlay and so on... I can say it's almost perfect but then these days when I exported my video, some of the video clips are blinking especially if I applied many features in my editing :( . Hope it will be fixed asap. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very cute and it works well, plus it has a lot of features that I still haven't discovered yet. The problem is that with every video I have saved or shared, when I open the app again it says I need an update to edit it, and when I manage to open the file, every clip has gone, but the audio, the effects, the texts and transitions are still there. Please fix, because it's the best app I have used for editing, but this is very upsetting for me"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I use it for my animations, I'd like to report a issue idk if it's a bug but when I try making a animation and insert all the stuff. I get everything done but when I export, everything deletes in the exported video even though it's in the editing spot. Then I have to open a new project, put the clips I want and then the audio from the exported video. Idk how to describe it I'm sorry if it sounds like nonsense but if ya can figure this out, I'd be very grateful, I love this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's an awesome video editing app! But I just want to say that whenever I am editing and it's about lots of minutes/lots of inserted pictures/videos, it's getting laggy as in, it's not moving or anything. Edit: It keeps saying Video deleted etc etc etc, I tried exporting 5 times but it keeps saying the same. So tell me, how am I suppose to use this goddamn app if that keeps appearing?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good for editing, although i keep having problems with the keyframes. For some reason, if i have have 2 keyframes with a graph and 1 keyframe without a graph after, it puts the clip to the bottom right side and moves it to the original place? I don't know if this is supposed to happen or not but i don't know how to fix/disable it, I've already tried reinstalling the app, still nothing, if this wasn't a problem, easy 5 stars, unfortunately i have to put it at 4 for now, please help!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Almost perfect! I can't remember the last time I downloaded an app, paid or free, that worked as well as this one does. Very easy to use, although some of the features may require a bit of play and practice. But it even has features that high end video editing software like FCPX doesn't have, like the speed curves which are so intuitive. While it won't replace FCPX, it is now my go to app for videos for insta/Tiktok. The biggest limit for what this app can do is your imagination."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been using this app for edits for the past several months, and while it was great in the beginning, the text update that happened earlier this year has been really bugging me. Editing text has been so much worse ever since they overhauled it. So much more difficult to select text, block behind brand new text is obnoxious and shouldn't be there by default. Settings are pretty bare, no way to stop vibrating when cropping text. Super annoying. Overall an okay app. Want to change the version back."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut mobile app is a powerful tool for video creation. I love that you can add multiple layers to your story whether they be audio or visual or both. The audio effects tool is also fun to play with. There are, however, things I wish I had control over like nudging a overlay image or voiceover into a slightly different spot. But that is my only complaint I have about it thus far. And that the online desktop version isn't as easy to use nor does it have as many features."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is honestly great! I've had alot of good experience with it, but some things are bothering me. E.g the reverse feature really doesnt work. At all. It either says 'couldn't reverse' or it gives me the outcome with just a blank screen. Second, the results of the video are usually quite pixelated. Idk if that's my phone though. But Overall it's fantastic!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hello, I highly appreciate developer's work for this apps. It is great, with good customization like pro video editor apps. But sadly, starting approximately 2 or 3 days ago, effects in and out animation for text, layer, and sticker isn't working. Please fix these problems. And if it added chroma key support, I will appreciate it more. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good, it has a lot of useful features and it's great that you can access many different editing tools without having to pay for any type of ""premium version"". I would say the biggest issue right now, is the frozen frame after every split made in a video. Anytime you split a video, the following 1-2 seconds after that split was made, stays frozen. There's no way to fix this at the moment and it can get pretty frustrating. Until they fix that, i'm giving a 4/5 star rating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One of the best apps to edit videos and photos. But the only reason to give this app a 3 star rating because of some disappointing things. Like, if the video is kind of long, some part of the video freezes. And the main reason is, the STYLE section's 3D ZOOM and 3D ZOOM PRO are not being showed in Android 10s or lower. Capcut should really take some actions to it and give a chance to the editors with low-end phones."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, for the most part. Well, as great as a free editing app can get. There's lots of unique effects and stickers, and I love using it for edits. However, I just have one issue, which kept me from adding an extra star; some of the transitions don't work. I apply them, and it says they're applied, but nothing happens. This is a problem for most of the Effect transitions and all of the MG transitions. Sucks cause I'd love to use them. Otherwise, wonderful app though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE THIS APP! I use it to make videos and edits! The graph update really made everything better. The chrome key is good and useful. Just like the stabilizer! I can add more than four-five overlays! It's easy to use and great for beginners. All though there is a glitch. Every time I try to shorten a clip, it makes it 35 minutes long. Then I have to undo and it becomes annoying. I hope it fixed! It seems like I'm not the only one who experienced this..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Simple app for editing. However the key frame feature bothers me alot. You can't move them. You have to position it just right to place a key frame, and you don't have the ability to drag it around the picture. I find it hard when I add the 2 key frames, and I drag them at all, so I have to redo it again. Overall, the app is good. Capcut is a good starter app for editing in general, but somethings like the key frame issue needs to be fixed to make it just a little easier."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Technically this app is really good, it has many different effects etc. But it's nearly impossible to use it cause it always glitches, which impedes the editing. Lately the reverse option doesn't work for me and other people as well (seen it on the internet). When I try to use it, my phone completely crushes either in the beginning of the process or close to the end. I dearly hope for the improvement"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi Capcut team, i really appreciate this app, cuz i have been using it for editing my tiktok videos. I really love the functions on this app, but recently i couldnt dowload those effects such as animation, transition, etc. Most of them are either black or blank. I tried downloading those effects again and again but it wont work. I thought it was my phone/house wifi problem so i reinstalled it, but turns out it's the app problem. Hope you can fix this problem. :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've loved your app and have been using it for probably around 1-2 years. And recently I'll be making a video, export it and make a new project with that exported video. And it'll not be in sync, it'll freeze on random moments and replaying it or deleting the app hasn't worked at all. I hope this will get fixed soon, I really like Capcut and all it's amazing effects and would hate to move apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for editing, but although there are a lot of bugs and it's really lag. Based on my experience with this app, it's great! But whenever I try to post an edit of mine or I make a new project used from my old one, it always cuts stuff out. I tried deleting it and downloading it again but it still doesn't work. But I when I see other people's edit it doesn't happen to them. I hope u guys will fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a really amazing app!It has so much features and its easy to use.I've been using this app for 3 years and it's quite good.But i have two problems,When I add some effects to my video it just lags and crashes and it takes forever to export that video.2nd problem is that when I go to templates it just lags a bit and I have to restart the app.Overall its a good app.Thank you‚≠ê"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I started using this app, it was great. But after a while, the app started functioning improperly. There's a lot of lag. So even if the timing is right in the app, when you save or export, the timing for your video is off. The new effects and sorting of the effects are really jumbled, they removed a lot of popular effects used for editing, too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think this is a great app! Only a couple complaints. For one,when you put the slides too close together you can't put a transition. Which makes it hard because when you want a transition on that tiny slide it won't let you. Second, a lot of the times when I try to screen record it it starts lagging a bunch. Maybe it's the app I'm using to screen record but it hasn't done that until now. Overall, ithink it's a great app for beginners like me!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is really easy to edit with. When I'm playing the vidoe though it lags like crazy and gets really hard to add keyframes or split the vidoe where I want it, it also gets really blurry so it's hard to see the vidoe too. The templates are also a really big annoyance because whenever I try to find the one I want it ether brings me to a different one or it says it was deleted even the other people say that they can use it, i don't know if this is a me problem or its for everyone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never Thought this app could be better than Kinemaster itself. It has amazing graphics, Mind-blowing Text Features, And excellent Transaction effects! It has everything that an Editor would need. Love it! Just needs one thing in Text/Captions, 1. Add your own Fonts Option. I've also been facing a Bug type of thing with the Text Feature, It doesn't let me Animate the In and Out Animation. That's very Disappointing for me.. please fix this as soon as Possible!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this app to edit videos all the time and it is really fun to use. It makes editing for starters really useful and the best bit is everything is free! But it always lags and crashes, the text is really glitchy like if you make a typo the word duplicates itself. I don't know why this happens but even unstalling the app doesn't fix the glitches. Please fix the bugs- Alessia"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a very good app which I personally use and recommend. It's great for making edits and great for overall editting. Some filters can be messed like the freeze frame etc. You can't use audio recordings in it or at least I can't and you have to either choose from the given songs or you have to video record it. It helps if you have tiktok because you can take some tunes from there but I don't have or want tiktok. So the only things they need to improve are the songs and the weird filters.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love capcut to edit all kinds of videos. But there are a few things that still need improvement, for example that it snaps your text to the middle of your frame. Sometimes it's really helpful, but sometimes not. And what I would like is the option to use an in and and a loop animation on my text. But apart from these small things, it's amazing, especially since it's for free and doesn't show any ads!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app, but the most basic tools are flawed. Moving videos, texts and photos around is sometimes very annoying (and takes a lot of time) because it's snappy and not smooth at all. Same happens with things like editing the 'mask' option. Captions, text and stickers are also ALWAYS linked to videos, making it impossible to edit videos without deleting captions/texts in the meantime. There's no way to 'unlink' the text and even if you create the text before adding the videos, it gets linked."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was a great editing app. I always use this when we have a video project for school. The only reason why I gave 3 stars and not 5 is because sometimes even if my connection is stable and my storage is enough, it still hang and lags. It frustrate me in many ways. One time, I was already exporting the video and it reached 99% but it suddenly turned black and everything starts all over again. That's my only concern, hoping that it would be better with this update. Overall it was a great app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Yes. Capcut is such a good editing app as it has a lot of features. But the reason why I rated it with only 2 star is that it is laggy, causing the audio and the video to be delayed which makes it hard to point where the beat is. That is the biggest issue capcut ever had. Besides, it is a good app for editing, I really hope this issue to be fixed ASAP. I'm using a Samsung J7 Core, if it is not capable for my device, Pardon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been editing in mobile for years and this app is amazing! Lost for words I really love it. But it will be a dream come true if you guys add more transitions and animations, it will be cool also if we can animate stuff like drawing, animate the effects for better outcome just like what we can do in text, fading audio video, and being able to put ""in"" and ""out"" even there's already a ""loop"" And there's a bug that I've found, sometimes whenever I cut a clip it changes from a different clip."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This was honestly great, until loads of new updates started rolling in, and the glitches followed after. I don't recommend for android devices, as its an absolute nightmare trying to get anything done. Sometimes when you tap on media, the all suddenly makes it 30 minutes long, without fail. And after you fix that, maybe by deleting the picture or shortening it, you can no longer interact with any of the media. The app can't handle over 70 pictures either, which is awful for YouTubers."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best video editing app ive ever used. Its perfect and has everything i need. Ive been using it for a very long time and never had any problems with it till the recent updates. When i try to edt a video to match up with music, the audio is out of sync and the beginning of the video lags a little bit and speeds up for no reason. I hope it gets fixed soonüôè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a very good app I love it I thought it was bad like most other apps but it has no watermark and way more effects than you can imagine it also has chroma key which most apps don't have. It also has no ads which is amazing! It's easy for beginners because it's not hard to get the basics it also has great transitions and the smoothness of the transitions It was an amazing experience I and I will definitely be using more often and I totally recommend!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use this to edit videos for my channel, Empyrean RH! This is an easy way to make diverse videos. 100% beginner friendly- I tried kdenlive (basically AE) before this and it was way too advanced! Love that there is the option for premium but it doesn't force it on you- tempts me to get it more. No intrusive ads and no watermark. I don't really recommend the music, but it's very easy to import your own! The chroma key is not the best and I wish there was an effect search bar, but I love this!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Your app is undoubtedly one of the greatest editing apps for phones. However, I have two main issues that constantly bother me:Any text, filters, or effects at the beginning of videos take about a millisecond to start before the actual beginning. This forces me to cut it before I can post it.I consistently encounter problems when centering video text, stickers, and other elements. It's frustratingly laggy, and it takes several tries before I can recenter them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is the best so far. I use it for tiktok and editing, and it works amazing. You can easily remove the watermark which is at the end and you can just remove it by cropping your vid. But one thing that annoys me is when I put a text it automatically makes it go in the middle ifit makes sense and if your trying to put it somewhere close to the middle it will move it on it's own and at the end my work is not so good it looks unorganized, so maybe if you can fix that, that would be great."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Thanks for the nice and easy layouts for this app. It was great with the templates and all, but one thing is that when the template has slow motion or applying something heavy, it always shows black screen and suddenly my phone black out itself. It was such lame to experience that. maybe just me tho, but so far it was fine. I suggest to make this app has it own storage like how telegram works. Thank You !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has shown a drastic performance decline throughout the past few months, and I'm absolutely fed up with it. I spend a good two hours putting together clips in CapCut and adding subtitles to the complete project, which by the way is 8GB and 46 minutes long, and then set it to export for a good hour, and then when it was done exporting, it's not even showing up in my gallery, but rather showing that CapCut is taking up 8.3 GB of space on my phone. Fix your app, please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's my first time using this app and I can say that it has great features but my only problem is when I put the in/out animation of the pictures, vidoes, and texts and replay the full vid it doesn't apply. I have to put it again and when I play the whole vid other animation dissapears, it's really frustrating because you can't get the outcome of the video that you really wanted. Please fix this problem. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"okay, so it is a good editing app and has amazing filters. but recently when i try to export a video the results will turn out satured and the exposure will be really high and basically it just ruins my video quality and ive tried to fix it many times but it just keeps on putting filters on my video. and then it lags a lot when i try to press play please fix it im literally begging y'all üòê"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was a lot better before the update. When you try to type something, the words don't pop up at all until you export it and anytime you try to backspace a few letters, it will spam the screen with ""enter text."" It's really annoying I definitely liked it better before. Used to be one of my favorite editing apps, but it seems that now I have to find something else. Fix this and I'll give five stars. But for now, I do not recommend this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of the best, if not the best free editing software on mobile. It has zero ads, no watermarks overlapping your videos, every single feature is available without having to pay, and not to mention the sheer amount of things you can do to your videos with this! There are so many different transitions, text fonts and styles, You can trim, split, and crop videos with extreme precision, and even add your own audio files to a video. I've used this hundreds of times and I love it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut isn't really a bad app, good or even great edits can be made on capcut, and the app is mostly just for editing tiktoks anyway. It's easy to navigate for beginners but I would say that alight motion photoshop and videostar are better, but most of them have a paid version, this is good if you want something free and easy to work on. But the graphs are.. REALLY bad. Like not smooth at all üò≠. Just fix that and it's a solid beginner app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its truly a really great app! It's the only app I use for editing, I really love it! The only reason I'm eating 4 stars, is because reverse doesn't work. It takes a solid 2 or 3 minutes to get to 100% and even then, it says ""couldn't reverse clip"" and it's very annoying. It may be a bug, but it really needs fixed if able. The other reason is because slow motion is very choppy and not smooth. But, other than that it's really great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to enjoy the app, range of features, and ease of use to make great quality videos. My recent upgrade experience, however, left a bad feeling. I purchased the Pro upgrade, but the Pro features were never unlocked for me. I tried to contact customer support numerous times, but have never received any response or follow-up. Upon purchasing the upgrade, I also have had more problems within the app (including the inability to login to my account). Not worth it. Switching to a different app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really loved this app, but not too long ago the app started to bug out. When I try and clip audio it will move when not touching it to clip in the wrong spot. You can move pictures to the right spot because when you place then down, they'll move over, same with the audio too. And it started to glitch were I'd have to long in and out of the app to actually play the video, and I could only do it once before having to go in and out of the app. Before all this stuff happened, the app was amazing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent and easy to use timeline video editor. Unfortunately I've gotten an update that I cannot use, I press the button in Google Play but it does nothing. The app will not work anymore either, but this is probably just a simple bug that will be fixed soon. Please get the app fixed soon! I know nobody likes troubleshooting, but jeez I was in the middle of video editing and then got an update.. I couldn't use the update button in Google Play and now the app won't let me play videos at allüò≠"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is the best video editing software on android that I have used. Better than 90% of the other stuff including paid. One complaint is that it broke one of my videos entirely. It gave the message for all the videos on the edit: ""The video has been deleted or moved"" when that was not the case. There should be a feature on Capcut similar to one on Filmora where you can ""find missing clip"" instead of having to replace all of the videos entirely and practically having to redo the video. It's sad."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a grate editing app!! Something I love about it is that you are able to take off the watermark for free! Thats absolutely awesome!! But something I hate about this app is that if you delete a photo, video anything from your gallery, they won't show up in the scene. I think its horrible! I spent 4 hours editing on a video, and I deleted most of the pictrues and video that I was using. I came back to check if the video was good to save now, but it was all gone. Please fix this :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app but there are a couple of glitches, for example: 1. When I want to import an audio from a video and click add, nothing happens, 2. When I for example want to crop the video and click the check mark to finish the action, it just kicks me out of the edit and doesn't do it. 3. I can't import anything. Please fix this asap and it's 5 stars!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to understand and use, however whenever i download a sound, capcut takes a while to register that you have that sound downloaded in order to add it to your video. For example, I downloaded a voice recording of mine, but its not showing up in the list of sounds from my device that I can add. Capcut, if you could please explain this, I would appreciate it. Otherwise, Amazing editing software."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is honestly one of the best mobile editors. It has a simple layout and some great features all in a package that doesn't have any Paywalls or an annoying watermark which is great. Although it does have one small issue. You can't add audio from your own device? It's something you can do with literally any editor but for some reason I can't import any audio from my device to use in a video it's something so simple I can't see how that was missed but besides that overall a great editor!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, its honestly one of the best editing apps that exists, however I recently was editing and a problem occured where whenever I split my video into clips the same clip would keep on going and it's really starting to get annoying. Please fix this but other than that it's a good app and I recommend you download it! EDIT: I redownload it and it's fixed :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great if you make shortform content for apps like tiktok, but if you want to make long or thought out videos, this app is just not it. The more things and details you add, overlays, cuts, and sounds, the longer it takes to load, and if it exceeds a certain unknown limit, it just completely ruins your audio buy offsetting it so that your video has a weird delay and exporting doesn't fix it. Basically, if you try to make a video longer than 10 minutes with frequent cuts, it breaks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. There's so much you can do with it. I thought I'd spent a lot of time exploring it but I've been pleasantly surprised. My one gripe though is that it's a little glitchy in a couple of places, the most annoying for me is that if you happen to tilt or move a text box, it's virtually impossible to get it horizontally straight again. Things have a little tendancy to jump around a bit which is super frustrating cos fixing things is really time consuming. 5 *'s otherwise.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 3 years and it has always been very good. Except now because of the pro feature, lag, and movement it can get frustrating. Capcut used to be free until the pro features. Now it's almost always a glitchy mess if you use one too many effects, overlays, clips etc. For movement sometimes Ill be moving the clip around and it'll get stuck or won't move at all. This is very irritating for people who tween on capcut like me. Besides all of that this is an awesome app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Auto beats needs fixing. It's not precise most times at all, sometimes it seems as if they're just randomly formed beats. Secondly the motion blur in this app makes the media green. It ruins quality, Third, when moving videos or pictures to a certain size, it take a long while tbh. And finally, the signing up options are not really....there. Suppose I dont have Facebook or Tiktok or maybe I just forgot my password, how am I going to sign up if I'm interested? That's it tho, great app otherwise‚ùó."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The apps great, I've been using it since 2019, and the only thing I'd say I have a problem with is saving my edit. SOMETIMES this happens, like every 5-6 months it doesnt let me save my edit and a gray screen appears, then closes my edit. I've tried to save it by duplicating it, but that doesnt work. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app everytime this happens. Besides that everything else is great and all works properly as it should. And the quality option is amazing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this is indeed a useful, convenient app to edit, i'd recommend this to my friends if they want to edit videos. but lately i've been facing bugs like after saving a video, some clips in the vid freezes. i review my edits before i save it but lately some of my clips freezes (but the audio is still going on). i hope you can fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for months, I started using it on my other phone. Overall, it's a very good editing app and what's nice about this is you don't have to pay for anything. But there is one thing I wished capcut had, the graphs. It would be better if you add the graphs and add the tiles effect too, but it's fine if just the graphs. Because the keyframe animations are not smooth which is my problem. Also, premium features might be good in my opinion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using capcut. It's very easy to use and it feels like one of the best free editing apps. Biggest problem I have is that it tends to glitch a lot, like when you play the video it looks like certain clips are glitching, especially around the transitions. However, when you save the video and play it back, it's fine so it all works out."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I went through alot of editing apps thinking they were good, but then I got loads of trouble after placing transitions, because of the lag. So I'd just guess where the beat drop is to place it, then at the end, it was always miss placed. This caused me to spend too much time on edits. With this app, I barely spent 30 minutes making a short edit. It has such good quality, good transitions, and good text fonts and editing. 5 stars. Amazing app üß°üíô"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app. It was easy to use, had a lot of transitions, and filters. The things you could do with this app were limitless. Well, that was before the update, or something. The app had difficulty with videos around a minute long or less, when before i could do 5 to 7 minute videos with minimal lag. It's annoying. Preview won't work at all. I've tried uninstalling, clearing cache, etc. It still won't work. Please fix this, I love this app really much. I would love to edit videos again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's the best editing app, like YouCut. It has the best qualities, it definitely deserves a 5-Star rating. But there are only 3 problems that need to be fixed: 1. When an audio is added, it glitches and finishes before expected. For example: Audio is 20 seconds long, it finishes on 15 seconds. 2. The app glitches and lags when video is a little long, and needs to be restarted. 3. It adds an empty 3-Minute video in the end. Other than that, it's perfect! Keep up the good work! I recommend it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The editing experience is fine, but often when I add effects it messes up timing and turns it really laggy. And it isn't just effects either, it can be in transitions, motion blur, overlay and when adding match cut. Luckily it only lags it and slows it for the editing part, and once it's exported the timing is usually ok. But sometimes it completely messes up the timing for me. Please try and fix this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I haven't had much experience with editing videos before but this app is certainly a great choice to learn. Though for some reason TikTok sounds aren't being shown up in the audio spot where you select the sounds you want to use. The audio is there saved in my favorite audio's on TikTok but it's not showing up on CapCut? Hopefully it's just a glitch that can be fixed. If it's fixed I'll give five stars.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a good editing app and I am pleased to say that it gives the user the freedom to do what they want with their video. Sadly though, I cannot give it an excellent rating because when I changed phones I have been unable to sign in because it only allows sign in with Facebook and TikTok which I don't have accounts on either platforms. It would have been a perfect review if the option to sign in included using your email. That is a big loss for me, time to find another video editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is really good, I'm thankful for all the prepared stickers, the overlay bursts are really good!! And the animation template is a nice touch, great job with that! if you were to update again, maybe add a tool that can drag cropped music back to the 0 second tab? because I have to manually drag it the way back, when i do cut the music. but all in all, this is marvelous! ALSO you don't even have to buy this, everything's all free which is the best!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi!! So actually, I really love capcut because it's so easy to use and has a huge variety of effects, but the reverse isn't working for me. It takes around 5 Minutes until I get to like 95%, but then it says ""couldn't reverse"" and I thought it was only because I didn't update it but after it still didn't work. Aside from that, really great app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app, wide variety of effects, transitions, animations, etc. Everything is free so you don't have to pay for anything. But since the update, everything I export has a problem where the quality will get bad for a second and then go back to normal. But it doesn't just do this once, it does it throughout the entire video. I went back to older videos I made that didn't have it before, and it was doing the samething. I don't need to update or anything so this is really annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best mobile editing software out there, has a lot of features and is very easy to use, no ads and free? damn, that's a steal if you ask me! There are a couple of features I'd like to see in future updates like an option to disable x and y center axis snapping, would like an ability to move anything on the screen freely, without the snapping having to interfere basically. Overall, amazing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved the app. It was great until suddenly, I could open and import videos, but I was getting the ""no connection"" thing for all of the actual editing options. I've tried everything, even deleting all of my projects and redownloading the app. Nothing. Very disappointed. Anything I could do to fix it? EDIT: it happened again. Reinstalling it, but all of the audio options work fine. Everything else doesn't."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's really good for beginners like me! If you want something simple and easy to use then get this! 5 stars Edit: I have been experiencing problems with capcut. When I press a picture or video it stretches it to 30 minutes long. Also the video goes off sync with the audio so it's near impossible to find out if it's on beat or not. Changing to 3 stars. Update The PC version is good. It's not lagging but it could need the style section and graphs. Changing to 4 stars.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So Capcut IS an amazing app. However it has some flaws. When editing sound and fx, the clip bars tend to jump around or disappear. Even when applying filters. The adjustment can escape your field of vision and you may not be able to figure out how to reset or fine tune it. The ovelay feature needs to be able to snap to original background size. For a free app, I use it all the time and think its great for cutting and splicing video. If they improve some quirks id give it 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app, easy to use. I personally like it and use it for making my videos, but one problem I've encountered recently is that when I export a video then put it into another project it ruins the video and if I make anything over a minute, it makes the video itself off timed to the normal audio. Now this may just be a personal issue, but I'm not behind on updates at all- it may just be a bug, but it's a bit of a issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app because it's the best, but it's not working on my phone now it keeps lagging until it becomes all black and I can't use it. I tried to restart my phone and uninstall and reinstall again. But it's still not working, I also tried to report it five times. It keeps saying capcut isn't working. Please fix this so that I have can work with it again. Because it's really good video editor app so far. Thanks"

But my WiFi is perfectly fine, I tried deleting it and reinstalling it but its still the same. Not only that, I find it fine if I don't get to search for videos, it's just inconvenient.

But there are glitches here and there like for example, when I try playing the clip I attatched, it doesn't have any sound even though it does. And then sometimes, the text doesn't show up when I add one and sometimes when I add an outro animation, it doesn't move or fade away or glitch out, it just doesn't show the animation. And it also takes long to compress a video to add it to the project so hope you can somehow shorten the wait. But ty!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really great editing app. The transitions I need, the text to speech, and the fonts I needed are exactly there! When I found out that my old editing app was terrible, I moved into this and I'm able to improve my story. But can you please add more voices on text to speech? I really need it especially my story has a lot of charactersüôè. Thank you!‚ù£Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app you can edit everything on it. One thing that could be fixed that has happend to me, is when you are watching over your edit when your done before you export it, so im watching it and than it stops, the video just stops. So I press the play button again so than it plays, but it'll bring me back to the start of the video. I have no more ""bad things"" that has happend to me on this app, so I definitely recommend it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this editing app for 5 months, very easy to use and perfect for beginners, here are some bugs that annoy me alot, 1, whenever i reverse a clip, it says that it's deleted! Even if i still have the clip on my gallery! 2, whenever I'm trying to edit, it always freezes the screen and crashes! I tried reopening the app several times, still doesn't work! So i didn't use the app for a day so it can work perfectly. I'm not able to delete projects after updating this app... Please Fix."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very solid and has loads of features that are easy to use. I'm giving it 4 stars because there's a big issue when uploading a new audio file. When I place it into a ""project"", for some reason, it plays a previously used file that I didn't select. And it still plays the wrong audio even if I delete the ""wrong"" file. The only way I found to fix this was by clearing the apps data, but that means I have to restart new projects from scratch again which is extremely tedious and annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good, you should download it right now. It has many features such as voice automated text, and moving very realistic transitions, and much more. So many tiktokers, and other platformers use this app! Even before the good update, this was a major blast! But, sadly, it has some problems: like there is not much good stock videos, and all the old filters are very bad, and a bit more ads then other video editors! But in all, it's super good!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's so easy to use for beginners and it's free too! So it's a total win-win! Edit: it started acting up a little (meaning that some of the amazing functions like the filters etc, stopped working because ""there is no internet connection"" when there was a good connection. Even the font changing feature stopped working because of that)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One word to describe this: brilliant! Does everything I need and doesn't ask for a premium to unlock features! Free is free and I couldn't ask for a better app! Add some more transitions, remove the 15 minute video limit and definitely a search button for finding/indexing music (because it can be hard to find the song I want when I have a large library), but other than that, this is exactly what I've been looking for. This is definitely becoming the video editor I'll depend on a long time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is almost perfect! It supports 2K and 4K, and it's super easy to learn and use. I also like the effects that are offered. There's just one problem: you can only use this app in vertical mode. This makes it hard to view videos if they're in a more horizontal format. Having an option to switch to horizontal mode would be amazing and would be 5-Star-Worthy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing editing experience. Very easy to use. I love all the transitions and effects. The custom speed curves, ability to add keyframes, or find beats are just something you don't see in mobile editing apps. Kudos to the developers. I would love to see the ability to add transitions to text or stickers. My only complaint is that in my experience, when adding a combination of transitions, speed curves, effects and a title, one or more of them just disappear."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is great esp. the Autocut to create shorts but there are 2 problems I have. First, I cannot export video from gallery into the app [it says file not supported] unless I import whilst using the app. Some videos are hard to find using the app but easier with gallery. Second, when you add music or pic, adjusting to your desired position mostly sends it to a different time but not where you actually put it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The features are amazing, like the transitions, overlays, etc. However, the app is really laggy, and I can't match music to a sound without going all the way back and starting over. Thats my only problem. I can't edit any videos correctly to match music because the video will stop right before where the clip is split/changed. Please fix this issue asap."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app. However, lately, whenever I try to put transitions for my videos, the app will suddenly freeze and heat up my phone. Then, when I close the app and get back to it again, it will freeze again, then it will take a long time before the app response again that I had to close it and repeat. I thought it was just my device but it kept on happening eventhought I installed the app again. I had to delete the entire section where I put the transition for it to function well."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really really love this editing app! This is the best of all the apps I've seen and tried. It's so easy to use and the features are amazing. But there is one problem tho, and it would be a really big help if you could fix it. When I put way too many photos and when I crop it too short it lags so much, it also happens when I put overlays. It makes it hard to edit because I can't see the result of my editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I'll keep trying to use this as the videos usually come out pretty smoothly and I like the template options. However, it keeps crashing and I sometimes lose progress on what I'm making, and it's frustrating. And most days, it won't open at all!! So, let's hope that reinstalling it will make a difference. If not: I definitely don't recommend trying this app unless you have a ton of patience. Edit: I just lost every single thing I've ever made, regardless of signing back in... y'all suck"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for editing, but I hope the developers correctly label which animation is a pro feature and which is not. It's frustrating to have to comb through the subtitles of a project one by one and change the effects just because a feature wasn't labelled correctly. Or, if possible, I hope the developers make to so that the reminder tells us which caption of ours is using the pro features. Otherwise, this app is amazing and user-friendly"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Having a sound waves section would be a valuable addition! I'm enjoying this app both on pc and on my phone but the one thing that's missing and would be very very helpful, is a section with multiple sound waves to choose from and apply in our videos with movement according to the sounds and music of the video. I hope that my request-wish reaches you, and If it does, thank you very much in advance! This application has been the greatest gift to me as an editor with multiple assets for free! üíô"

I am very careful and cautious when using fonts and i found that the fonts that are available here isn't really to my liking. If it is possible, please have an update that enables us to add our own fonts, OR maybe add a couple more fonts. Thanks!"

Though sadly when exporting it still lags my phone, not as bad as it used to though! I love this app and i HIGHLY recommend! Plus, its very easy to use! Great app, worth it, and overall just very useful and helpful. ‚ú© Edit: So its still very laggy when exporting... Also when i tried adding another effect to my video, it crashed. Please fix this.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For a beginner users, like me, Capcut is absolutely perfect. Honestly, I have absolutely no problem with it except one thing....well, two but one. It's about just how long it takes to actually export a video and the fact that if you delete a part of the video from your phone, it deletes in the video you're editing. For the latter, I would say I understand why that would happen but once I tried uploading an 8 mins video and just ended up sleeping off because it took a long time. Still, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, although it has some issues like every app. There's great things with the editing app like the transitions, filters, graphs, the home, like the shortcut, and the easy way to make a new project (edit), easy added overlay, and you're able to adjust the effects.. some of them at least. A con I don't like is that whenever I make an edit, half way the making it starts to glitch."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, I've been using for a long time now and it's a really good app but for some reason for the last couple months, the app has been laggy really bad for example whenever I try to upload/export a video over 50+ seconds it lags really bad and then crashes and I've lost some videos to this glitch but recently it's only been happening with videos over a minute. Even then that shouldn't really happen shouldn't happen, other then that it's a really good app but could use some upgrades."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app and very easy to master but what I would like to point out is the continuous lag. Whenever I'm editing, it lags like horrible. I need to keep exporting clips to check if they're even on the right time cuts. I've tried switching devices multiples times but its still the same. I thought it might be due to low storage, but even after I factory reseted, still no change. Its very infuriating at times so I hope you can fix that. apart from that minor issue,it's an amazing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! I had to give 3 but really would like to give it 5 stars but all of a sudden when I add transitions between slides it makes the music glitch out ü§î really ruins the vibe. Other than that it's awesome and worth a try. Edit: I read a few reviews and took someone's advice. After uninstalling and reinstalling it works just fine! Great app!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is really great for edits and its really amazing with flawless effects and animation. I highly recommend it for those who wants to make edits with beauty,but the only problem is that when I play the video while editing,its lagging a lot. I can only see the video after I exported it. And sometimes its not really perfect. But on the bright side,all of the features are free. I sometimes dont have a problem for it. Please fix this problem,I want to use capcut freely again. Im still proud u."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I actually really like this app, it's very useful for my animations and the filters really put everything together. HOWEVER, idk if it's my phone or what, but when I download a video the timing is COMPLETELY OFF. I will check my video to see if my animation is on time an ungodly amount of times in the app only for it to be completely off once I download. What's up?? This is really annoying and I want this to be fixed OR HELPED if it's user error. I use lots of filters if that helps"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing app to use if you don't have anything else. It has some good transitions and effects. But there are some things wrong with capcut. Like for example; there's no graphs. Editing apps like alight motion and video star have something called graphs to smoothen the effect. Another one, capcut should let us make our own transitions, it'd be a way better app if we could. The presets are a nice touch for capcut, but they aren't that good. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10 :))))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A VERY good editor. Free, no ads, no watermark (there's a little thing at the end but you can delete it or even disable it in settings), and some pretty good effects. The live camera effects are fun to play around with, similar to Snapchat. My favorite feature would probably be how easy it is to change the aspect ratio to something a little more cinematic for my short films. If you want an editor you can use to make some pretty good content, then this editor is certainly for you!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I'll be honest with this one. This app is really good for editing especially when you are just newbie. The transitions are cool, the sounds effects and others but there's one thing I really hate, whenever I am editing something, it always stop for a seconds and starts lagging. It so annoying and I can't edit the other clip properly because of that but when you export it, it comes nice and smooth. I hope it will be fixed soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut honestly! It's easy to learn how to, and how to use in general. But I would've put this as a 5 star if it didn't have this one bug/problem. When I try to create videos over something like 10-20 minutes, my capcut freezes and puts me back to the home, and when I had to restart a whole project just because it didn't play the beginning. What I think they bug(s) are/is is a time limit or you will be put back, and you can't put too much movement / key frames. Hope this helps!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was really good before but now it lags all the time, When I try to put an Overlay in, it skips over parts of the video or freezes at certain frames; and most of my videos aren't even that heavy 30s to 1:45 minutes at most, with probably 1-4 overlays/effects ect. Because of this its now unusable for me. I love Capcut, so hopefully this problem can be fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Edit: the font problem had been fixed. But the thing is, when i do new keyframes along with graphs, it resets everything! I don't wanna go through all of my edits just to fix them! Please fix this!! I don't like it. I was fine before but now, i just think that 2 stars is what you deserve.. (no offense but, you've really let me down this time)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a really good editing app for mobile, probably the best, in my opinion. Of course, there are some flaws, but it is GREAT. Some things I would like to be fixed in the future are for one: The Glowing Text color error... when I choose a specific color for my glowing text, it turns the color into a less saturated color. Also, I would like to see capcut be a bit less laggy. If the creators of capcut see to this rating, I hope they take the fixes into consideration. THANK YOU CAPCUT."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for a little while, idk what has happened but it is glitching like hell. The main issue I have is the image I'm using glitches out after it passes instead of going black like it used to, the text is playing up as well when I move it, like, it will miltiply and when I click off and on again it's fine until I move it, then it happens over and over, it's getting pretty annoying and frustrating. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesn't fix the issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is excellent for video editing in regards to adding pictures in videos and video overlay. However, the Remove Background feature is really flawed and it's hard to put things in place with precision. If there is a feature added that allows me to skip through my video frame by frame while editing, and a thing that makes it easier to adjust video volume, I will most likely do all my editing with CapCut going forward."

I even restarted the phone and tried,it made me put a photo but when i tried to put a photo again,it happened like the first time."

The little box to enter the text just disappear and now is almost impossible to manipulate letters,effects, animations, fonts, etc.. of your video text.

Two problems: There's a small glitch in which an image with play for a split second at the start, which is fixable but irritating. Second, it displays new clips I imported incorrectly, but when I view it, it's the right clip. Very annoying glitch I will be contacting support for soon."

Down to the effects, filters, animations, heck even where you can change the speed throughout a area to go with the beat to the song you choose, this app is AMAZING! The only thing this app doesn't have that I have been looking for is motion tracking. I really hope they add that in the near future, but other than that, this app is AWESOME! I highly recomend."

Just improve some of its bugs such as: 1) After pressing and dragging the end part of an audio, it tends to move the page down, know what I mean? It doesn't stay on the same page on where the audio that I'm editing is; 2) Please have an option to change the view from portrait to landscape when playing the video, especially when previewing the video itself, just to see the output;"

Even 4k 60fps exporting, video layering, frame interpolation for slower video and much more. Even the ability to extract and manipulate sound from video in-app. And all this for free. Trust me when I say I would pay for this app. Only if it had a better stabilizer function, a wider transition library, and more colour grading options and I would've requested for it to have a paid membership üòÇ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great video editor! Totally free to use, no watermarks, very user friendly! I have one recommendation: when you add sound from your files the app looks for sound from your device in a single folder (where your recordings are) and I would love a feature to manually select the file you want to export to CapCut, because right now I can't import music I downloaded from somewhere else. Keep up the good work and thanks! (Samsung S8)"

I want music to be silent for a few seconds but that can't happen without me waiting a few seconds then play the music while screen recording (I extract it). 2. If I move my pictures I put in there to another album or delete them I can't use them üò§. Besides those two things amazing editing and video app!!"

Please fix these inconveniences so I can continue using your app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is a very good app. Very nice filters, effects, and transitions. Also its a lot easier to edit with. The only thing I would complain about though is that it's very laggy when you are trying to view what you already edited, so you don't really know if the transitions are on point or not. It does also take it bit to publish but only if it's a long edit! I would recommend it though due to the good effects, filters, etc."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In my opinion, Capcut is great! There are some issues about Capcut though. First being the image cropping. When you crop the image in cropping, it crops the image and the previous part if the image is gone. (I didn't press ""done""). Maybe you can crop the image when it's done? Instead of cropping it while you want to crop it? Another issue is I tried to use a filter on my edit and it made my edit slower? So it was out of sync with the music I dont know what happened But overall, it's not a bad"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, it's a little confusing at first but after awhile it's easy. The only problem is that it's way too laggy during transitions. There are times where I'm trying to do an edit with a song that has a lot of beats but I can't do it smoothly since it keeps stopping and I don't know how it looks like unless I export it. New effects are cool and all but what's the point of using them when we can't even transition smoothly?? pls fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One issue, when you put your next clip before your music or overlay, it stays at the same time of the video when I add the clip and just shows the overlay too early. Overall, I don't mind with this issue! The app is very easy and this is the dining platform I use to make videos. This happened last year. In March of 2022, I used capcut to edit. At April 22 2022. I uploaded a well-edited video. With an intro and outro, cut clips and details. Like text. I've been using this app for an year. Thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is one of the BEST editing apps Ive used in awhile. It has transitions, animations for you video clip, effects, good filters. ect and it is all for FREE! There is even no watermark!! The only thing that I would complain about though is everytime I add transitions into the video, then I play the video, it just lags and won't play the video right. I don't think it's something with my phone because I have tried restarting my phone but it still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very nice video editor, but I've encountered. numerous bugs that are inconvenient and annoying. 1. When I pick a text to have the border style (white text, black border) style, it doesn't show up immediately, I have to exit and return to the project to see it. Along with that, if I choose a text with that style and I reenter the project later on, the text turns to normal white without the black border. 2. Extracting audio directly from a video doesn't always work, it often doesn't show up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, but please help: sometimes when I edit a video, I leave the app to do something else. Then when I came back to continue editing, some of my pics/videos are gone and it says ""the video/pictures has been removed, please check your system album"" when in fact, all of the media are still there in my gallery. It is such a hassle to go and add it again & sometimes I forgot which media I put in my video. I hope you can fix this. Thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app I've ever used so far. There's a lot of filter, effects and other stuff you can choose. However, I just noticed that these past few days it keeps on lagging. It's just frustrating cuz I can't timing the beat of the song in the transition of the videos I'm compiling. I tried rebooting my phone but it's still the same. I also tried installing this app to the other device thinking that maybe it's just my phone that has the problem but no. Pls fix it asap."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for around a 1 and 1/2 to 2 years. I've made over 200 edits and videos on this app and loved it until around two months ago, when only my newest videos are available to upload to a template. It could very well be my own problem, but whenever I try to upload photos/videos directly from photos app, it says they aren't supported. Besides that (which is a personal problem), this is an amazing app and it has so many options, the fact that it's free is fantastic too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This application is recommended, but sometimes it can have a lot of bugs (please fix the bugs) what are the bugs? 1) it clunks a lot (and I have a lot of space) 2) it doesn't save you the edits, so you waste all the effort and 3) Finally, it does have all the resources, but some do not, like: Cute cut, Alight Motion, Kinemaster, etc. Even so, the app is very good, apart from the graphics... Uff! Great, but please fix the bugs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I love this app, the editing tools are really good and the text placement is great, adding effects is easy as well. But after a while, I started noticing that the audio would begin to offset itself, lagging behind the video footage by 1 second on average after being exported, this may be a minor issue, but please fix it and I'll give this 5 stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really good app, worked smoothly, and nicely. Great options, but every time I use certain things on here, it glitches and freezes. When I use the text box in the little notification version, it glitches badly. Also, sometimes the whole thing just stops playing/working. Like, I try to play back my video, and it just doesn't work. It says its playing, but it's just not playing/working. Please fix this! <3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It's really easy to use and the edits always turn out great! But the reason I am putting 3 stars and not 5 is because of the lagging. It is sooooo annoying. Once you put a certain amount of photos in, it will start to lag, which makes it nearly impossible to edit the length of the videos and various other things. This NEEDS to be fixed. Other than that it's an amazing app, would recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This video editing tool for Android is most likely one of the best. It features a simple UI and is straightforward to use. It is simple to use and includes AI (or machine-learning algorithms) for video editing. There's an object tracker, easing animations, and a lot more! When I downloaded this application, I had no idea it would be this phenomenal. The only thing lacking is a button to turn off the vibrations."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, I really do, it's easy to use, has lots of effects, amazing things added to it and all, but the reason I'm putting the rating to a 3 is because, ever since the new update, every time I try to import a video that I've updated, the video freezes basically and only shows 1 clips that I've made and even why I uninstall & reinstall the app, it does the exact same thing. Please fix this problem so I can put my rating back up to a solid 5!!! Thank you for your time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, you get no ads and its easy to use. If you get stuck you can look at their videos explaining what each tool does. However. And this is a why it's getting 3 start instead of 5; once you are done editing whatever it is and lining up the audio playing it through to make sure its perfect and you download it to your phone suddenly the sound is out of sync with the video. This is very annoying and shouldnt even be an issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,‚ú® I LOVE this app! I'll start with some pros: the app runs very smoothly and the transitions are amazing! I love that you can record your own music from another device or import it from the actual app! The whole app is really great but I do have one problem... I am not a fan that you can only log in with tic Tok or Facebook! Because I don't have either of those and don't plan on downloading them. I kinda wish you could log in with Microsoft or Google but other then that the app is amazing! ‚ú®
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app many many times for over 50 memes/edits and this is by far the best video editing app I've used! There's a lot of content for a free video editor, having everything ranging from basic transitions to custom keyframe animation, and there isn't any watermarks as of right now and I'm really happy about that, lol. Though, small concern is that exported videos are usually slightly off time compared to the in-app preview of the video you're working on. Otherwise, great app :D"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So I started using capcut a while ago since some of my friends used it for some of their videos, (Check out my friends' channel - WinterFoxXEdits). And I can say It was not a dissapoint! I can see why my friends really enjoy the app! Apart from that you can even press auto-lyrics and the lyrics you choose from audio appears without you having to write and edit all the lyrics.. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.. For Sure!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it! Super effective and fun. Probably good to do edits and more! üíï I've been using this app for some time and it's totally sick! Epic transitions. But one problem, sometimes clips can be a bit laggy. It's annoying and makes it hard to edit. Suggestions is to be able to convert audios to text, for example an audio plays and it can be converted into text onto the video! Regardless, awesome app. Totally recommended for beginners in editing as everything is clearly written and simple. üòã"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The editing experience was great . But the timing on my videos were not correct. After the ending of all my videos, the video just went black and it stayed there until it couldn't go on anymore. It would waste my viewers' precious time if I kept them on my YouTube channel. Plus, I couldn't cut it all out. It just wouldn't allow me. If there's any way to fix this, please inform me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, not much else to say really. Simple to use with a lot of a features (I still recommend KineMaster for beginners, alight motion for more advanced stuff). Still, I'd like it if you could apply effects to text. For example, the edgy effect on text would be amazing to see, especially for some ideas I have. Other than that specifically, great app. Also, make it so you could adjust the speed of stickers, we some stickers I'd like to use are a bit too slow."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Efficient and easy video editing app. I used CapCut to make my tiktok edits, and my creations always looked smooth and appealing, thanks to its amazing animations and effects. It provides you with a variety of different editing options that are easy to learn and apply. In the future, I wish the game could have default overlays. For instance, in Canvas and Video Star, where there were already default editing overlays that I could implement, instead of having to download them online."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One of the best video editing apps with many options and it has no watermark. The only issue I have with this is that there are times that the video lags while editing. There was also a time I was editing a video and then on the next day, I cannot open the video I was editing and it said it's because of corrupted footage but it doesn't explain further. I also reported this issue but there was no response so hopefully their services improve when it comes to resolving technical issues"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a pretty good app for begginer editors, but a few things i'd like to mention is the blue line that centers your text, image or video. it is REALLY annoying Capcut and I wish you could make it an option that you can turn it on and off. last i'd like to mention is the new update. the new update removed the basic, and now i can't find the old effects that were good. i'd just like to add it back. when it's gone, i'll give it 5 stars but for now.... 4 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, up until this bug showed up. So I was making a video and I clicked on the screenshots to shorten them, then it started glitching out and made one of the screenshots 45 minutes long! So whatever, I deleted and started over. But then THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I got annoyed, but just did it again, and guess what, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN! We NEED this bug to get fixed, please, I don't know what's happening but it needs to be fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good I have been using it for the last three years but the problem is that since it got the new update I am not able to use google templates. And secondly, when I want to make an edit the first picture/video comes on top of the second picture/video. Like a glitch. And thirdly, when I want to fit the scale of any video or picture, then that picture starts looking backwards. And sometimes the video starts to slow down. So, Kindly fix these issues. I shall be very thankful to you.‚ù§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, amazing editing app, especially for being free, but I do have a slight issue that can make using it aggravating. About 50%-75% of the time I click to use the app, it immediately kicks me out again not even a half a second later, and I've even tried restarting my phone as well as clicking back into it multiple time with no success. I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling it yet because I don't want to risk losing all my edits if it doesn't even work. It's very irritating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"MY RE-EDITED REVIEW: 5/5 editing app. But there is room to improve: -Possibly a 'remove split feature because I feel like the more splits, the more lag the video has. -MORE TRANSITIONS!!! Love this feature and hope there's room for more. -More in-app music. I never find myself using the music because my videos never have a part where the music is needed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's simple and easy to use but the only thing I dislike is the loud vibration sound it makes when your adjusting clips (moving them around and that sorta stuff) and when you try adjusting the video effect (whenever I use a video effect and try to move it around, it makes the vibration sound). it's very embarrassing when I'm trying to edit my videos while anyone is near me. I might've worded it wrong or it might've just not made sense and i apologize, english is my second language."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its one of the best editors I've found. It has a simple amd easy to understand interface (that's what its called right?) and also a good sum of editing options. Also, having a watermark is optional, which is a MASSIVE plus. I do wish there were more stock videos but I believe it'd be better with less to save storage. Something I really wish was that Capcut was available to Windows as I'd definitely download it to edit my videos! 10/10"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was actually great until I tried to continue editing a video I had been working on for four days and it said some footage was corrupted but I never deleted any or turned off my phone. I did exit out of the project before closing the app, too! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ it added so much happiness to my already rough day. Thanks capcut! Right when I didn't have any more time for it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Yhe app is very good! In fact one of the best free mobile apps I've seen. One thing i would like to suggest is being able to customize your effects(speed/position) and speed curves for the animations. Overall just being able to change yourself the effects and transitions. Also, using the in and out animations on the same clip will be really helpful! Some new effects would be great too!!! Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"5 stars from me. I learned about the app thanks to Modern Millie, due to a video CapCut had sponsored. It's easy to work with, no annoying ads, yet full feature list available, I like that it has god SFX (anything from laughter to clinking glasses) as well as music options; I also really dig the speed feature and the transitions, it even has multiple audio tracks. Honestly, I would be happy to pay for this. If the app doesn't change, I am sticking with it, no need for any other editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this program for a good while for making edits. It's very simple to use and, with the right techniques and a few tutorials, you can make stuff similar to AfterEffects. It is a little big (goes over 3 GB) so I'd recommend having a good device or a lot of storage space for the app to work smoothly. I do have some minor qualms about certain features (Reverse, for example), but there are loopholes to make them less annoying and more manageable. Still would reccomend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing! The only problem is when I add a video it's always glitchy and doesn't go with the audio. It's like it plays one part of my video every three seconds and it doesn't look good at all. This may be because I have an Android phone because this app works perfectly on my sister's iPhone but if you could please make it accessable to all devices that would be great.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"How is this free? I've since deleted all my other video editing apps, and I choose to keep the CapCut ending because the app is so great. I haven't had any problems yet, but I can't seem to find out how to move the marker to a precise position without zooming in the timeline. It would be nice to insert the timestamp via keyboard and have the marker to perform an action at the EXACT position (eg. To create 30 second split at exactly 00:30:00.0). Other than that, it's perfect for my usage! üôåüî•üéâ‚ú®"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm still looking for the ""catch"", üòÜ (seems too good to be true). This softwares is incredibly easy and a lot of fun to use. It's faster than most editors. And, there are more effects, enhancements and features than you'll ever need in a lifetime. If you want to spend your time *producing creative content*, instead of being frustrated figuring out 'how' to put your ideas into your work, I highly recommend trying this software!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like how it has match cut, no watermark, good quality, and it's just overall simple and nice to use. Some things that could be better though is the slow motion because it's not smooth and turns out really laggy, the graphs could be better as well, and the app should have motion blur for the transitions to look better. But other than that, it's a great app and I definitely recommend!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app very good to use. I've used it for years and there are lots of bugs that I found while editing. Everytime I add Overlays, I didn't know what happened but the video just not responding. Its video still remain the Overlay and the picture. Hopefully, you understand this. That's just I wanna tell. This is not harsh, but a report and I'll rate 4 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have an editing style in which I use key frames for a fade out but I also change the speed graphs (with motion blur applied so it looks smoother.) But now when I try and do it, it deletes my keyframes, if not deleting them it only adds the keyframes to the end of the clip. It's really bothering me and I would like to see how I can fix it. I've uninstalled and installed, I've cleared my cache and still nothing. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Can actually remove the water mark. My go to video editing app. Update: now whenever I try to play back my edit, it jumps cuts and freezes making me unable to see my progress unless I have it. This is frustrating Update 3-12-22 reversing and making my edits slower on this new update SUCKS. it took TWO HOURS FOR ME TO JUST REVERSE A A SHORT CLIP. Cap cute what is going on???"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, especially the filters !! but, then again there's some things about them that are hard to comply with. for example, I think you guys should have an opacity setting for stuff like the color negative filters and maybe even the cartoon filters as well- or maybe an opacity setting for all of the filters if you will ! besides that, this is a very very good app !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good but the features aren't what you need them to be. Using custom to speed up/slow down certain parts... But you can't pick the exact duration nor the exact second you want it to start speeding up at. Trying to get it to go into Timelapse at an exact point in the video is just impossible. After an hour of trying to get it behave I had to move to a different app, thos one just doesn't fulfill my needs"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's a lot of cool features and effects that are easily accessible, so put shortly, this is a really well made editing app. My one issue is that it's recently starting having this sort of strange thing happen where if I'm importing an image that has a transparent background with it's opacity being low, like a filter, it imports it way darker and less saturated, which is a serious problem for me. I don't really know how the heck I'm supposed to fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut, I use it all the time for my edits. However, recently, it's been not as great. If I have a video that's 1 gb, the app glitches/freezes and kicks me out of the app. If I try to play my video to see if it's on beat, it lags so badly to the point my whole phone stops working. I just want good quality, however it's impossible when If I have a file over one gb the whole app crashes. I've been using capcut since 2021 and this is the first time it's done this with a 1 gb file/video.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's one of the best editing apps, there are almost no ads otherwise, none. The downside of the app is its pretty hard to learn how to use if u just started. Otherwise it might be the best with all the cool transitions u can do and the effects. I love it for making videos but sometimes it will glitch and I will get kicked out, my progress will then be lost but it rarely happens so its fine."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After I reinstalled the app, my problem disappeared. With this app, I've made loads of edits. The only problem is that the slowmo is not that smooth and that the quality for my videos is not that good. It would be awesome if they added a bit more effects. I've been struggling with some edits, cause I can't find any effects that could make my edits better. Hopefully the velocity edits could be easier to make as well! That's all, if I'll have anything to add, I'll make sure to do that!!!!!!!!! :D"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Out of all editing apps I've tried, this is the best one yet! I've used this app on Instagram edits and YouTube uploads, and it never disappoints. I highly recommend that you try this app. Although there is a problem that I've been noticing overtime. Sometimes, when I slow down an audio and pitch it, the pitch button doesn't work. Please fix this issue. Thank You"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Capcut it's really great for making edits, it has a lot of cool effects and once you learn the basics it's pretty easy. However there are a few thing they need to improve on, the videos can glitch if you: add certain effects, add a lot of overlays and sometimes the sound glitches and its hard, but usually when you download it, it looks good. Other than that it's useful and creative app I use it almost every day. üòÅ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First, if you accidentally delete your edit, there's no such thing as a ""draft"" or ""previous delete,"" so you'll never get it back (it's annoying and depressing when your 4-hour edit is gone), second, it occasionally crashes and freezes, and third, the text box capacity is so limited that I have to create another text box to extend it... There's more, but for now, this will enough."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Excellent interface. Poor export quality. The controls are pretty easy to pick up and you can always watch some videos online. The effects available for free a very robust and you can make great compositions.. however the video export quality is not up to par. I working with 2k 60fps video and editing in the app is fine, but the export you can see a lot of blur even on max export settings.. it's like they are cutting down the bitrate too much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a great editing app. Easy to use, efficient and there's no watermark, only an end card that can easily be removed. But I didn't give it 5 stars for a two reasons. 1. It lags a lot sometimes and sometimes crashes for no reason. 2.It sometimes goes well, then lags and goes off time with the sound then when you fix it, it happens again. If those could just be fixed, this would be 5 stars in my book."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! I love the different features etc, but whenever I try to split a clip, it never splits? Anyways I give it a 8.5/10 since it's a great app. Sometimes the app is laggy, but I believe it's because I have an old brand of phone. Great otherwise, anyways I just think this app could use a decent amount of work, don't get me wrong it's an amazing free app but I just think it could use some editing!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app, many editors should use this app. But there are a few things I do have to say When I want to add a song to my clip it says ""no internet try again"", even if I have all possible internet source's on it just won't work. But if I try a different song on the same category it will let me use it. I also suggest adding more songs that are used to make memes and more because capcut will not let me use songs from YouTube to make videos. Thank you for reading, have a good day."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This has been the best app i used for my edits, it was actually going smooth and great at the start but now? I don't know anymore. First of all, i get this bug where video just stops playing in the middle of nowhere, it just stops after a few seconds i played it, second, another thing i love about this app is the speed curves, it was great and smooth back then but now it's just not so smooth anymore, i just hope you'll fix this bug because i love this app and I don't want it to become bad."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fascinated by the ease of use and all the tremendous options for editing, I began my journey with CapCut. Unfortunately, on 2 occasions I've lost all my footage, I'm now currently working on two separate videos, of which, are constantly freezing and crashing, to the point that I can't even open up my own projects anymore. I've messaged capcut several times with the specifics to my problems; of which, I've yet to get a reply. I literally am forced to stop working on my projects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app one of the best editing ones out there. I just wish it wasn't so buggy. Like it lags the video way too much and it doesn't always work when trying to match cut which is disappointing. But other than that It's amazing for what it is. Here's an update: I haven't used the app in a while but really recently it just strait up crashes every time I try to start a new video. I'm not sure if it needs an update but when I go to update it just loads I've tried many things to help
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I first used this app I thought it was perfect because it was free and a good editing app. But recently whenever the app has been updated a feature or two end up weird and glitchy. Now my text is disappearing randomly when I try to move it, and sometimes when I try to reverse a clip it will have a green bar next to it? Or it will just tell me that it won't reverse. If the app is updated again I hope everything is fixed and it won't mess up other features. Thank you!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi! For me this app is totaly amazing!! But there are still glitches in the app that need to be fixed. Could you please fix them. Here are some of the glitches; 1. I also sometimes edit Youtube videos here which is about 21 minutes long. I realized that you could not save a 21 minute video. The app would be more awesome if you could save a much longer video than 7 minutes. Please fix this. 2. Some of the overlays and sounds that I put in my videos get messed up, but I put them in the right spot."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good and the quality is great. But the editing is buggy specially on the overlay, video, and the audio.When I put overlay on the correct spot, you'll see it moves forward a bit, it's still really connect correctly, but it's still confusing, you had to save and quit then edit the video to fix this issue but it's always happening same thing with the audio. The bug in this editing system was so terrible as hell that it waste your time. Pls editor fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a really good app. But if you save a project, a day later it won't work, I mean the pictures on it won't be seen and says ""The video/picture has been deleted or moved. Please check your system"" and somehing like that. Today, I was working on an edit, but the pictures on it saying the same thing I didn't even saved the project and it was ruined, so I had to redo it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Have been using the app for a bit over a year now for personal and work projects, honestly one of the best free options on the market. But!! Please!! Please bring back the ""Blur Close"" video effect!! That one was so so handy for endings, not a fan of the only black screen closing options. Unless I can't find it but I've searched the effects a lot since the most recent update."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app has a fairly wide variety of transitions (none of which are locked behind a paywall thank goodness), and the quality of the downloaded video holds up well. Unfortunately however, the app has become very laggy a few months after downloading it, which makes getting perfectly timed transitions a bit of a problem. I've even tried deleting past edits and other apps to clear up phone space in case that was the issue, with no luck. Final product is fine though, it's just the preview in the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"LOVE ITüî• It's great for editing but I had one issue. I like to do long edits so having to crop each individual image and them not being the same length really bothers me, if you guys could please add a option to set all pictures the same length. Like you would press all your images, then a screen would pop up saying something like ""How long would you want your pictures"" and an option at the bottom""Nevermind"". This is a simple issue that I believe a lot of people would like fixed, or added."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best editing app that I used! It has tons of effects, transitions, and if you don't know how to edit, it has plenty of templates that you can use. There is one report I want to make (not really a problem). There isn't a mild shake effect like on Filmora Go. This does have one similar to it and I would use it, but there is a color border while it is swaying so I have to zoom it to remove the border from the frame, but my picture/video would get pixelated. Other than that, it's a 9.8/10 for me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app. Although it gets glichy sometimes but other than that its a good app for edits. In my opinion though there should be more transitions added every now and then. Another thing is that there should be groups people can make. To organize their edits. For example a folder or ""unfinished"" ""done"" and stuff like that but people should be able to name their own folder and make as many they want. That's my opinion and I think it'll help other people."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Best of all, the editing software I've tried so far. Using this application for almost a year and a half. I was so happy that this app has improved so much than before. But then this haven't been fixed yet by the developer. It keeps bugging me as usual when I try to edit or so it happens to other editors it really is. The lag. If you please fixing this. It has so much worth effects, filters, stickers, and a whole lot more. I'm just looking forward to my ONE complaint fix which is LAG also.Thanks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is so frustrating!! I don't know if I have a non-updated version of the app, but half of the features don't work correctly or just don't appear at all. I'm trying to make a velocity edit, and the splits are not cooperating correctly. So I looked around for the 'auto velocity' feature, and the 'Style' button doesn't even let me click on it! It's incredibly frustrating, and it's even doing it after I uninstalled and reinstalled."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Trying to use the volume setting is absolutely frustrating, it jumps in uneven increments and trying to reset it to 100 is nearly impossible as it'll automatically jump to 99 or 102 instead. This issue has been happening for almost the entire time ive used capcut and ruins the entire experience. Came back to leave the same review only to find that I'd already left one. Making it so you can type in the number you want the volume to be at or use arrow keys to do so would be a simple solution."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is very easy to use! It has effects and filters, easy to import videos, pictures, and audio. I do very much like it. Problem is, you have to keep the photos and videos you've added in your gallery or they will disappear from the add as well. It doesnt save like it says it does. You'll need alot of space on your phone if you plan on keeping projects"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I NEED COMPUTER VERION NOW ASAP. But it is really nice and helpful tho, it has no watermark for free and it has a removable ending, and there are templates you can use if you are lazy (but you took time to find a choose it) and it has this remove background feature so even without greenscreen it works, it has some filters. Better then Kinemaster. The number of glitches ain't that much but the thing is that the slots keep getting out of place (it appears so) but it really is in the correct place so it is hard and sometimes when I record my vioce the sides get a little bit cut so I just need to leave some time space. I really recommend it there are so many features but it is really easy to use because I used this when I was like 7 years old but the video turned out great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great for my edits. It has many cool stickers and effects. The best part is that it is free!! And you don't have to have capcut's watermark on your video of you don't want to. The only thing I would suggest would be if there could be more selections for transitions & and effects. Also I don't like how it freezes and glitches at times. Sometimes I have to export the video to my gallery just to see how it's turning out because I can't see it when it plays up. But I love it overall.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE CAPCUT. It's a very useful editing app from beginners to professionals. It's very simple to use, but I hope they make cool stuff easier to use. Like the triple screen mirror videos. Since there's no option for it, people have to improvise making it much harder. There is also a problem with some videos. In the middle of editing your video the whole screen goes black and you have to scrap the video. I would love for this to be fixed if all of this is done, capcut is the greatest app of all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Three ideas I think could help improve the app. 1. Being able to grab and move multiple items at once, like texts, overlays, added audios, and some other items you can place down, instead of dragging and placeing a item down one at a time. 2. Having the ability to make folders for multiple projects that are being made, It will feel faster than just scrolling, and it will help organize things. 3. Have a little control buttons for precise movements when dragging something on screen."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If I'm being completely honest I wish I could give it 6 stars!! Its so easy to figure out, you're able to remove the watermark, overlay, use all of the animation styles, FOR FREE!!! the only problem is when you split a video it doesnt work corrects but that's just a small bug and can be fixed by exiting out and going back in really quickly! I love it so much!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I Love this app so much! I use it to edit a bunch off things. I recommend this to my friends and family. I really like this editing app. Not going to lie, it deserves to be top. I love all the effects, clips, audio and more. The overlay is amazing and so is the ""trending sounds"" I love that you can connect your tiktok account to caput which makes it easier for the audio. I also love how you can extract audios which is really good! The best part is there's barely any ads! DOWNLOAD! ITS AMAZING!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for edits and there's no ads, but there is only one problem with it that I can't fix. There's this thing it does where before every video I put in, it always speeds up at the beginning (the speed on video is already on normal) and then turns back normal. Though it goes by quickly, it's hard to edit. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing, and sorting out my storage, but it doesn't work. If you can fix this problem, please fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed using this app. It's my first reel editing app. But I'm starting to get annoyed with some things. First there's no way to insert a newly shot video once you start a project. Second, the music sucks. My phone reel creator has better music. And when you try to search for something, you get really weird results. And why no Country? Theres pop, hiphop, etc? I do enjoy how easy it is to create the reels but those things above bump down the stars for me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this I use it everyday. I would like to see one change, when I am cutting up different videos to put them all together I have to upload each clip into my photos to be able to edit them together. I would like to be able to cut clips save them in my Capcut folder and then add them together without the extra step of uploading them to an entirely different area. Besides that I love your App."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good for the most part. Very easy to learn and use. Very good for beginner editors. Though I wish they'd fix the bug where clips or pictures become glitched out and green when the edits get lengthy (I usually have issues with 25-30 seconds long). It either occurs with too many clips, longer clips, or too many transitions and effects. But if you don't mind exiting the app every little while, it's a relatively good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the app was really good at first. It gave you lots of options for transitions, filters, texts, and you could delete the ending as well which was perfect. But then when me and my family moved to a different house and set of the wifi, the app started glitches constantly and then it wouldn't let me use transitions, text, filters, anything. I could only cut and move my videos. It's very frustrating and I would like some help to learn what to do to fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"An excellent application, I highly recommend it. but as every application has its flaws, this one is no different. the two mistakes that I hated the most was that when it was time to crop the image it would bug and crash The whole screen, and the second is that you have no option of searching for audios in ""yours sounds"". Please set this option to search for audios in your sounds. Apart from these two errors the application is very good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"idk if im the only one that has this problem but, when i use a template like a velocity slowmo template from tiktok or something, when i add the video for the velocity slowmo and i want to see the results, it takes so long to load, im always stuck at it loading at 50% and it just there for like a very long time, like everything is fine, my phone is fine, the wifi is fine, it's just the app. i hope u guys can fix this because it's so frustrating. and also sorry if it's confusing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this since like 2019 after switching from Kinemaster and this is definitely my go-to for editing or making random videos. Recently however, there was an update and my capcut has been glitching like crazy. Whether the image is regular or an overlay, it keeps blinking in the background and even covering itself with the same image! It's super annoying, especially when making edits that require a lot of overlaying, animations, images, and effects. Please fix this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app! It's so useful, and so easy and there are many tutorials on the internet. So many unique and wonderful effects, and transitions and animations and as well as being a great editing app it is also really fun to use. I would recommed it, and I love the way it lets you take away the watermark at the end. It has basically everything you could need, so if you choose CapCut have fun using it! And no lags or ads, but the effects and animations do need internet."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is one of the best mobile editors ive ever used. with lots of effects, customization options, and easy to use interface it has to be the one app ive ever used with little to no issues. the previews are similar to the real speed as well which is great for making video edits. the only issue ive ever really had is that if you add more than 3 photo overlays throughout your video, the preview starts to slow."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app overall, just some small errors that need sorting. On certain images if I click on it, it will extend one image for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Also if I click on images it takes me to the end and making it not possible to edit. I have pictures with a friend who lives on the the otherside of the world and I want to have an edit of memories with him but I can't use this app if it doesn't work properly. Just those errors need fixing then it would be a truly amazing app and I'd be very happy"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great! I've been using this app since 2020 and only till now where there some issues. For example I'm editing a voice over for my friend and usually when I would move clips of audio it's smooth and doesn't buffer,however that's changed since the new update. Things automatically delete,even the slightest movement makes everything buffer,now with the new update it's hard to find the effects I need,I thought this was a free app but now you have to buy a monthly pass to unlock effects(?)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing app overall. It's easy for begginers and their app is not confusing at all to use but I do have some cons for this app. First their app lags for no reason at all. This has happened to me a lot and I still don't know how to fix it. I have switched phone but it still lags. Second, their helping guide in aligning texts and pictures are very annoying somethimes. Because sometimes I don't really need it but it keeps bouncing back and their alignments in sometimes inaccurate."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a decent app however I do have a few complaints. My little brother deleted the app on accident, no big deal just reinstall it, but non of my work was saved which was super frustrating. It's features are unreliable, depends on the update wether they work or not. And finally, some files can't be accessed which hasn't proved a big deal for me, but still kinda annoying. Other than those 3 things I love this app and it's fun to mess around with :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for a while and it's really great. But something weird started happening whenever i am trying to make a video for the past few months. Whenever i add photos or videos it keeps glitching and the screen keeps flashing black and white. The audio doesn't work anymore and when i try to resize a clip the other clip beside it comes behind the clip im trying to resize. Idk whats going on and i tried to download another editing app but nothing is as good as this so plzz fix this!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Basically has almost everything you can ask for. I am satisfied with the huge varieties of functions. There are a few flaws though, the video doesn't successfully exports sometimes, although usually only for big files., the limit of text is a slightly too short. Lastly, the ""limit"" of adding musics/sounds, it becomes either very laggy or the sounds won't be heard anymore at all. But overall, this is the best editing app I've used."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I want to upload a video or edit it (without effects), it glitches and randomly pauses while the music continues and then it just jumps the photos that got skipped. Even when I post it on Tik Tok, it does the exact same thing. I've had this app before and it did the same. People told me that it's my storage but I have a lot of free space open... Fix this glitching problem please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good editing app, it's easy to control and easy to find stuff. But speaking of finding stuff, it's hard to find effects I want in my videos. For example there's a new hair color changing thing that I think is very cool so I try to try it but I can't find the effect. I tried updating my app, so don't start that lame excuse. That's the only real fflaw I can find so please, fix it. Otherwise, I recommend to anyone who tends to create!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this app was good at first! but i realized it's hard to do things such as blur some parts or lack of effects. if you want a decent editing app, this is the go to! its good that its free and doesn't have watermark, but i have issues in navigating the diff. things i use in editing, like the text & overlay for example. idk if it just my phone, but when you split it, it doesn't go smoothly and you can tell where was the split cuz of the sounds of that video, is lagging. hope it'll be fixed later."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an overall good and effective app to edit on. However, the new update completely butchered the app making it difficult to edit texts. I suggest you change this so that we are able to see our text and what we wrote. Another annoying issue is that the app limits where I can move the text. The text has to be according to their lengths. It would be an even better app if I could move the text anywhere without the text pausing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,CapCut is surprisingly exceptional for a mobile video editor. I originally downloaded it to edit out a small but very offensive clip. Though I kept it because of the large amount of tools that it provided WITHOUT a watermark. The only thing that I don't like is the compressing feature. It tends to break my videos and doesn't even work half the time. It gets extremely annoying especially after I have to wait 30+ minutes for nothing. Is there a way I can disable/remove the compression feature?
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a genuinely good editing app, especially since it's a free editing app. But there is a few glitches, one of the most annoying one is with the text. The text won't show up after confirming and when trying to delete something the text ""Ender text"" gets pasted into the text box. Please fix this glitch so I can still make the content I like."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app! but, I have a complaint. so, when you add text, it has 3 options ON the text, to delete, edit, copy, or make it bigger. this is VERY annoying if you want the text small, because you can't move it without it doing one of the options. and there are buttons for each option, so I don't understand why its there. other than that, amazing app for edits and videos. but maybe not videos over 7 minutes, it lags for me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for a year, and since then, I've had no problems with it until last week. I don't know what happened, but it just started lagging whenever I added animated texts, transitions, effects, and motionblur. My capcut is up-to-date, and no matter how much I reinstall the app, the same problem still persists. The lag I'm talking about is, when I play the preview of the video, the app starts to slow down until the effects are done. I can't make an edit because of this problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Worked great until recently. Some of the transitions (notable under the camera designation) don't work anymore. No matter how short or long the transition length is it stays the same on the video. Transitions like pull in/out ect. I hope it will be fixed soon. I also had an issue where the app wouldn't let me see my favorites because I didnt have internet (which I had) which was resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app!!! Although it's not the most advanced editor, it's a really good app. There are multiple free effects I was overwhelmed by at first, as well as auto velocity, sound effects, animaited text, and many other fetures. There are also hundreds of free templates, or you can make your own template to share. It does have a watermark, but you can delete it for free. The only issues is that it's hard to center items, put them in the place you want. Other then that, I definitely recommend!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is just great! I use my recorder or take screenshots for a video then it auto maticually enters it! You have a free choice of animations effects and stuff you can crop it and all kind of things like that! It doesnt even take up to much storage. I always make youtube videos with this. But the only problem is when i try to look back at a video it deletes it and makes the screen black but other than that its a perfect app for editing making video etc.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app. Video editing is very easy with the help of this app. You can edit photos and videos and connect songs according to your choice. And through various effects, the video can be made more beautiful. Because of which this app is always in my favorite list. But I wish there were some more edit options that I can't use or I don't know how to use them. .But if all the editing tools can be made free, the popularity of the app would have increased and it would have been easier fo"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It a wonderful app but there is one thing I would want to change about it. They should have real songs and more choeses to choose from that's all I would change. But other that that the transition is good and it's easy for people to learn how to use it. Great app I would definitely recommend. Great quality and u can choose a lot of pictures to edit and u can even use noises like sound effects. 100% recommend and it's even use full for gifs and presents for family and friends. üëçüèª Love it alot.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love how user friendly the app is. The transitions, animations, audios, it was very nice. But then, I am so disappointed. Whenever I forgot to add a picture and then add it, after adding I always find myself in the home page of the app, instead in the editing page. Same goes with the audio, once I added all the things upon creating, ang whenever I want to add another and access in the gallery, it always exit. I hope you can fix this because it is so annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm so glad I got this app, it is great for my music videos!! I've searched through dozens of other apps and I think this is my favorite one for music videos. It has good quality, the effects are amazing, and pretty much everything else it has to show!üòÅüòÅüòÅ If you love making music vids, then I recommend this! I also love how they update it almost everyday!! They add so many cool animations and effects. But something they could use a little update in, the transitions. Just a thought.ü§î"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Capcut, I like your app because it has more stuff comparing to other video editor apps. But I rate it 3 stars now because 1/ I couldn't use Capcut fully when off line, 2/I couldn't use Reverse: I wanted to reverse a very short video clip about 3 seconds, but it took me 5 minutes for done 99%, but then it said couldn't do it. I tested few times. Please take a look and upgrade, and also fix the ""Reverse"" function. I will rate 5, if you do those. Thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good ngl, I love it, but I have a complaint and also a request. Could you add the Scratches effect without the frame ? And also, when I add a lot of pictures or videos, it becomes really laggy and I have a good phone, 20gb of storage free and not many drafts, so it really annoys me. But overall, a great app when you know how to use it properly :))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I totally love this app, tons of transitions, overlays, and more editing tools for free, and there's no certain limit for the clip, I love this app very much but I have only one problem with it, it is so BUGGY! Whenever I try to edit a long video, it will either freeze or the timeline won't move. I don't understand why? CapCut is a great editing app, But I feel like it's getting worser and worser. I don't know if it's about my storage but I can't edit if this continues, Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's always been my favorite editing app. But since the update I've been experiencing problems like I can't crop the videos to the middle, whenever I export it, the video always starts where it started and not the one that I crop it. Next thing is, the preview is good but when I save it in the gallery the clips will like flicker or something, and it is soooo laggy. It all starts when the update. Please fix this. I love capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first I was really in love with this editing app, I've used this for months now but for some reason everytime I edit a video it always lags, I didn't really mind it. But then I started to use it again all the animations, stickers, text fonts are all just a black screen I can't see any of the transitions and stuff! I tried to uninstall it and install it again but it's still the same! I use a Vivo Y11 and I hope you guys find a way to fix this. Thank you..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly,this app is really easy to learn compared to others,and the graphics ain't bad,but I can't give it anymore than 3 stars because of how laggy it gets 2 minutes into editing. There's also this problem where after editing a scene that required a lot of screenshots in a few seconds,the app suddenly broke and I can't use any of the text fonts, animations,effects etc. It was nice using this while I could but now that it's like that I can't do anything now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"super good app!! it's easy to understand and once you know how to work it, it's great to use. there's just one problem, any time I try ro reverse a clip it 1. doesn't work and goes super slow 2. overheats my phone and 3. when it works it gets stuck on 95% and says ""Couldn't Reverse"". does anyone know how fo fix this? please lmk! other than that, it's amazing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a pretty good editing app but I can't seem to sync my tiktok account with capcut. Which is really disappointing because I wanted to use my favorite tiktok sounds. Also, I read that some features are only available in certain countries. Like the Me option is not on my Capcut app but for people in other countries, it is there for them. I hope there is an update that fixes and adds these."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is probably one of the greatest apps yet! You see, most editing apps always limit their transitions, effects and filters to the point where you can barely use any, that unless you buy them or use 'premium' which I find is extremely annoying. But this app doesn't force you to buy premium or make you buy certain effects which I like! Also, the transitions and effects are perfect, thanks for making this app, it really helped."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think this is the best video editing app out there. I also love how they link original TikTok sounds. However, they've started to have a few bugs. For example, in-app file sizes have become ridiculously large (GB size for less than 60-90 second videos) that make video playback laggy while editing and in turn, are a huge pain for placing transitions, text, or minute cutting right. Occasionally, the project closes too. Everything is fine and appropriately sized once exporting the video though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is by far the best video editting app ever! However, on the recent update where pictures had an 'anime' and 'comic' filter, I noticed a huge major problem. The filter only has lighter level of color for skin, which means, people of color cannot utilize this feature. I just hope that the skin color filtering is just a feature you (developers) are yet to include and is NOT any form or subjected to colorism or racism. Thank you for your service, I look forward into more updates in the future!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite editing app, but please do not reduce the quality of the video and I hope we can make our own animation like 3d or smooth shake. Plus, please add more smooth animation, I hope you listen to me. Edit: I just want to add something, for the next update, I hope we can put more animations in one video/picture without exporting it. Another edit: please add tiles effect and I hope we can group our videos or picture like alight motion, but this is still my favorite editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's an amazing app !! all those choices transitions, animations and effect all for free is an amazing deal. i appreciate this app so much cause it's the best I've came across, thank you for creating this !! however, recently all the choices for transitions, animations, filters and basically everything seem to not be working for me. i reinstalled it for plenty of times yet it's not being fixed. Please fix this issue, i really love this app and want to have it work properly for me. Thank you !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A really great app! No watermark and really easy to understand, it even let's you import your own music. There's a small issue though, whenever I overlay something and I try to move it across the screen there's a black line around it? I don't know how to get rid of this, but I'm trying to work my way around it. I'd just recommend an easier way of moving overlaid things and getting rid of that, but still a really good app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honest to god, I love this app. I use it for a variety of different things, editing videos for my channel, adding text to already made videos, etc. It's easy to use and doesn't take very long to get used to. The effects are great as well. You can import sound, photos, clips, and you can even use greenscreen by using chroma key and overlap. 10/10, would reccomend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My only problem was that I was trying to make a video and I saved the pictures to an SD card but had them all in order but then I opened CapCut and they were scrambled with all of my pictures. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, turning off my phone, and even moving the photos from album to album and it wasn't working. Other than that, I live this. Best editing app I've come across and that's saying something. I've tried every free editing app there is."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As someone who used windows movie maker growing up, this editor is good. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there but definitely not as much as movie maker. So maybe thats why they dont bother me that much. The one bug that has happened maybe once or twice is that it doesnt let me watch the edit while editing. There is a fix (just change volume of a clip). The app isnt gonna be perfect and could be better. But as it is free, its good for what it is."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Has many features, very good filters, but if you edit more than 2-3 things at a video, you have high chances to have problems rendering.. ""couldn't load, tap to try again"".. pointless spending time on it and at the end you can't render the video.. UPDATE: tried and gave as much info on feedback option, but ""unable to submit, try again later"" error message."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"hi! first this app is amazing and it's the base for most of my edits, but it's something about the velocity, first, it's very choppy, and before the update we couldn't change the timing, but now we can. but it got worst, for some of my edits i use velocity and i put it to 0.5+ then it changes to the beginning of the video, it happened with 0.3- too. And because of this I have to cancel my edits. Please fix this thanks!!<3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Found it did all I needed, however, you can't overlay an image on your video. This would have been 4 star, but I had to switch to my phone to edit sense my other device quite working, but it doesn't work on my phone. All the features work but the video and audio will not play. Good app for beginners if you are lucky enough to have a device that the app cooperates with."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is AMAZING! See I always had to use multiple apps to make the edit I want, but CapCut already has everything I need! It has so many creative transactions, effects, sounds, stickers etc... it's free, easy to use, and it doesn't force it's watermark on your video. However if my edit is long with too many effects, the preview lags a bit :( but well, this is the only problem I had, all in all it's a great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing. I love it and it's one of my main editing app's but every time I add text then move something the text goes from one place to the other, not even to where I moved to the thing and sometimes when I extenda clip it'll expand too far and I'd have to restart my phone or I'd be left with a really long clip :( . I really hope you fix that but otherwise it's pretty great"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ok so c Capcut is a great editing app. I love the effects and the amount of stuff that you can do with it. But I have a very annoying issue, Every time I try to move an effect or overlay or clip, It glitches and moves somewhere else. If I want to fix it, I have to leave restart the app, I don't want to restart my app 20 times because of one edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because I have tried so many other ones that required you to pay for the general editing. The only problem I have is the text. Sometimes, when I'm texting fast it lags, but I understand that. Most apps do that. However, when I click the effects for the text, the text stays plain and white. I close apps, even shut off my phone. I am SO annoyed at this. I am just a normal youtube that edits the same day I post please fix this, or at least help me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and use it all the time, but there are a few things I want to be added/suggest! More effects and fonts because I feel there aren't many fonts while the others are barely used, as for the effects, I want more variety as well. Now I want to suggest something, why not maybe add a thing we're people could sign/log in because if I decide to switch phones, that means all the work that is on the app on one phone won't save once I download it on another phone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, at least for a free one, literally the text is so impossible, you spin it by ONCE accident and you can't get it back straight and not to mention how annoying it is to drag stuff to where you want it, because the blue lines always stop you. But it's a good app if you wanna make a fast video, I suggest another app for more serious stuff! AND it has no ads!!! If I remember correctly lmao"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app!! Although a few issues. If you make an edit and delete the photos afterward, you cant watch the edit again because the images just say ""image was deleted"" or something and show a black screen. Also it can get very laggy if you use certain effects. Overall a good app with many options for edits but a few small issues! I recommend it a lot üëç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! 3 things missing though. You could add a feature to where you can move and size the blur and pixel effects to hide things. You should also make the new text animation avaliable for your videos and overlays! You should also add green screen videos beside the albums and stock videos where you could put effects like explosions for videos. Also, you should make stickers able to be cropped and frozen for video effects. Also, where is the style filter?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was a fantastic app until the latest version. The favorites in Video Effects no longer works, it says no internet connection. They removed many Style effects. Mostly the 3D zoom and 3D zoom pro (which I used A LOT). I have no idea why they would get rid of it! Please fix your app! I love CapCut and have been using it for the longest time. I would like to continue using it. If it doesn't get fixed, me and my friends are moving to a different editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is such a great app and I use it to edit my YouTube videos. However, I still do have issues for this app. When I edit the speed, it doesn't fastforward smoothly. It kinda turns out looking like a stop motion video, if you understand what I mean. Also, it's really hard to put texts or any object near the lines because it automatically snaps to the center. I hope you fix these issues because I am sure to recommend this one. üòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app, but there is a few problems i really don't like. 1st, when i try to put in the pictures of videos, the preview of the pictures/videos doesn't show. It's hard for me to find the pictures/videos when i want to make video. 2nd, when I'm editing, sometimes the video becomes really laggy and i don't get why. Hope it gets fixed! xx"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Quite simply the best editing software for mobile there's no competition. It's like a mini adobe premiere in your pocket It's so versatile as a mobile editing software. I've been using it for almost a year now and it's incredibly useful. Would definitely recommend this above all else. But If I had to make any recommendations at all it would probably be let user tilt there screen but asides from that 10/10
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for a phone, I've been able to be very creative in editing with overlays & speed manipulation. Only improvements would mention on the color adjustments (already decent) but also the export in 24fps is a lot less smooth than you would expect. 60fps is not necessarily supposed to be the ""smoothest"" option. I would like to export in 24fps of I shot in 24fps without losing quality of original video smoothness. Been a great app and will continue to use it as it's been one of the good ones."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Capcut is one of the best free editing tools in my opinion. The only thing I don't like about it is not being able to put intro/outro transitions in with loop transitions. For example say you want text to fade in but also wobble. It won't wobble until after the fade is done. that's my only complaint. I highly recommend the app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay.. for once a video editing app that beat all of my expectations!! I love it! It's so perfect that it left me wanting one more thing: controlling the volume of audio clips in the same way that you can draw custom clip speeds.. only suggesting it bc I know you can make it happen, lol. that's what's keeping me from giving this app a 6 star review. =P"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One of the best so far. Until I got issues with overlaying pictures. It just doesn't overlay properly, it covers the whole video even though I already adjusted the size. I got another problem just a few days ago and until now, the app keeps on freezing and the play button isn't working. I can't finish my video because of this, and because of this I now late with my deadline. I hope they can fix this issue, because it's really a user friendly app except those issues mentioned."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrid, I'm not sure why the issue continues to repeatedly happen but it just does. Okay, this app has 1 major problem, the fact that I can't even edit. Everytime I attempt to crop something? It ends up breaking, and all the buttons turn invisible and I have to restart the app, not even being able to crop. When I try to add to my edit, it just doesn't work and shows a black screen or glitched screen. It happens everytime. It could be my old phone because it's known for being slow. Or the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really really like this app! Good for editing! But here's something I would like to add (this is optional lol). For the premium stuff, can we watch like an ad or something to unlock it? Because i think some of us wants to use at least one premium thing (like me). So if we can just simply watch a short video and unlock it, that would be great! Other than that, 8/10 would recommend! :) Also, there are a few bugs. If I click on the keyframe, sometimes the item just zooms in randomly. Please fix!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app started out very great, a simple tool to use for any type of editing, video creation or meme making. However there is many cons for this app in the past week. Here is what I have experienced. Fail to Export fully (Export screen goes blank then sends me back to main screen, seems to do this for videos over a minute) Constan video lag while the sound is ahead by a few seconds. I exported a 40 second clip, and it is having issue to play without freezing and skipping."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's literally so good it's my go-to editing app, anything I edit automatically goes here. CapCut also has amazing quality and other stuff you can explore on the app. The layout of the app is very simple but at the same time I wouldn't recommend for beginner editors. I would say it's for editors who have lots of practice. You can download cute fonts and mess around with the app I love it so much it's just so amazing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I make several edits using capcut. I've been using capcut since 2021. For being a free editing app this apo is amazing. The animations are awesome and so are the text styles. You can draw your own text if you want to. Overall capcut is amazing. The only problem I have is that for removing the backgrounds and the future where you can remove it yourself is making the eraser smaller. It's not small enough to fit in between fingers and stuff and I just wish it was smaller. 100% Recommend.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like capcut so much! It has really good backgrounds in the canvas section. And nice fonts and animation. Maybe we can also use fonts we downloaded from dafont. And sometimes the app crashes. For example when I add a transition then I want to watch the video to see if its good then it keeps taking me back to that transition. Pls fix it. But it takes some time to export depending on the duration. So pls fix that. Overall its such a nice editing app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So you see the issue is that when you add lots of effects to your video. It really gets laggy and then the it effects the audio isnt played at the right time. Playing the video to see everything is alright turns to be really laggy. It only when you download the video that you can see everything clearly with no lags. This can be a problem to me as I have alot of projects and downloading an incomplete file just to review and the noticing the issues I dont space for downloading incomplete files.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app. Good transitions, quality, and effects, stickers and more, but it's just that, the app uses too much storage and spaces. It's worth it but, sometimes I just can't export my hardwork. If it's okay, can you reduce the spaces and storage we have to use for the video? But if we aren't talking about that, this app is amazing!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At first it was a really easy and great app to edit with.. But the longer I use this, it becomes so much lagger. Whenever I place an overlay video or photo, it lags! It's so irritating and annoying! I thought it's because of my projects (there was a lot) so I deleted some of them. I have 300+ projects and there's 12 left now. But guess what, it's still laggy! Seriously. I deleted some of my important projects just to fix it. It's so annoying! I hope you can fix this. I'll try to find better apps"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app especially since it's one of the easiest to work with that I've found and has lots of fun effects, audio, and transitions vs other video editors. This also has no watermarks or premium versions you have to pay for. I really love this app more than any other editor! Only problems I have with this is that you can't work offline since I'm off the internet occasionally and am unable to work on edits. Otherwise this is an amazing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything is surprisingly amazing for a mobile app. However, since it is a mobile app I could understand why it most of the times it lags a lot when I'm trying to play back my video and edit to test. If you're a video editor like myself, you would know how crucial it is to be able to replay videos smoothly to catch small details. You guys are doing great, I just wondered if you can do something about the glitch replay and also with the speed up option. That's all! ~ : D"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So, it's a very good app! I like to use this for my yt channel as the watermark can be deleted and doesn't get in the way! I've lately been having problems with it though, when I export a video, it freezes in random places and where text should be is not there cause it's frozen, if you could find a way to fix this problem, I would gladly appreciate it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app enough to give it 5 stars, except for one major issue. I used this app just a few days ago to make an animatic style video and it was perfect. But since the new update, images being able to snap to a set position on the sides of the screen has been removed. This is a travesty for me because now if I want to have two frames of an animatic in the exact same spot so they can look like a clean movement, I can't do it on the top, bottom, or sides of the screen. PLEASE FIX THIS."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its kinda good for editing but I hate it when the processing is so long, I wanted it to reverse but it will take like 30 minutes to reverse it, The file isnt even in Slow-Mo or the file wasnt even heavy. Is this a bug or its natural?? If it is please fix it, sometimes it can happen when you wanna make the Slow-Mo smooth, it takes so long but the Slow-Mo isnt too much. Also compressing files the file isnt heavy but it literally takes so long to load? Is this a bug? or its natural?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Look, the app is amazing and very simple. However, the lag is COMPLETELY ruining it. When I start editing a video and play it to see how it would turn out, it'll get EXTREMELY laggy and it really irritates me. When I get to see the results afterwards, it looks nothing like I imagined and the whole thing looked like it was so badly edited. PLEASE, fix this. Because of these dumb bugs I can't edit properly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is good, the editing has more options than other editors but this needs one thing so I can rate it 5 stars, that is a search bar for when choosing songs. I just got into editing but as soon as I try to choose a song, the list isn't even sorted, so it wa shard to find the song that I want to use. Hoping you would use this suggestion for the next time!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I've been using it ever since it came out, but... I do have some issues with it.. sometimes I try to animate and I have the perfect spot for a piece of the animation ( a picture ) and well, it just gets repositioned.. I would really love if you fixed this. Thanks! üòÅMaybe you could fix it like alight motion?? Maybe not.. I'm so sorry for camparing you to a different app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't like this app. I LOVE IT 3000! It's got everything I ever wanted in a editor! There is no ads at all. It took me a while to learn how to use capcut but now I'm use to it and I use it for Tiktok edits and Youtube videos. The transitions are nice and smooth, when the video is done it is laggy but just export it and it's not laggy anymore!!! I use to have powerdirector before this and it 'kinda' sucked because of the logo, no animation and not a lot of options. Tysm ü§≠üëåüèº"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Took me a little while to get used to the app, as I'd previously been using another one But, oh my goodness.... it's an amazing app. Really good app navigation, amazing features, there is the option for the paid version, but even if you don't, it's got everything you need to make a cool edit. Not to mention the numerous templates available....highly recommend, 10 out of 10."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just recently downloaded Capcut and I'm just starting to learn how to use it. The tutorial videos were super helpful, so that's a plus. It's very simple to use, and is great for starter/beginner editors. The only issue I have is that when you make a video longer, it starts to get really laggy and slow, and I know I'm not the only one experiencing this by reading other reviews. But other than that, 10/10! Would recommend for starters!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Total hit!!! ü§ìüé¨ I have been working with it for two months and still can't get enough of the numerous visual and audio tools! Absolutely love the video effects and body effects sections üëè Animation (try the 'combo' effects) and style tool ('pop up' effect rocks) are also fun to use. Audio effects and editing are also cool. And there is still so much to test, I barely scratched the surface. Great app!!! üòÉ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The application is very nice, but it must be improved. I think you should compare it to Alight Motion. It would be nice to be able to put in several animations at the same time, or it would be nice if we could use several colors in one post.For example, while writing ""capcut"", it would be nice if we could make the ""cap"" part red and the ""cut"" part white. New fonts should come. We should be able to add MP3 in sounds.I hope I have no spelling mistakes, my English is not very good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is very good. I didn't face any export problem. Or any other kind of lag issue ever using this app. But there is just only 1 reason for the 2 star review. Whenever i open a screen recording clip. The sound just desync. I dont know why. I also tried to extract the audio and sync with the video. And it worked for some time. But 1 day this problem got very worse. Now i cant even sync the audio. Sometimes the audio is playing before and sometimes after. I dont know what to do. Please fix it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I believe this is the best free editing software on mobile. In existence. first, there's a wide range of effects, transitions, and general editing tools. 2nd, You can make edits or full on casual normal videos. 3rd off, there's no giant watermark splashed onto the entirety of the screen for the full video, instead, there's a small endcard type watermark that you can either remove in app without paying at all (yes really) or crop out. my expectations before downloading were definitely met."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE THIS APP! It has different transitions and unique features. But the only thing that's bothering me is the glitchy or laggy thing that happens in this app when editing. Like, it was fine when I edited it, but when I saved it and watched it, it's like buggy. It flashes black most of the time I did my videos of pictures. Please get this fix! My friend wants me to do an edit for her and I literally can't send her the laggy one xD."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App bugs a lot for me. Delayes between video and audio when recording in camera mode. When I write texts, it often adds a bunch of gibberish in my text after I'm done. It will either repeat my last texts like 4 times for no reason or it will add a bunch of random letters after my text. So I all ways have to go back and erase the gibberish which doesn't always work. I can go back 3 times and more gibberish will appear for no reason. It's very frustrating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love how many options of effects, transitions, texts etc has; especiall i love that it has the option of overlaying! I would give it a 5 start if it wasn't because when i was editing (a very short video) when i played it while editing, it wouldn't play smoothly, the audio was not at it's right timing, the video played slowerüò•so i had to save the video to my device multiple times to see if everything was right like i wanted, idk if i can do something to fix this :( cuz u want to keep using it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am really impressed with this editing app!! The fact that they don't make you have watermarks on your videos is really nice because most editing apps make you pay to remove the watermarks. Instead you have the option to add it at the end of the video. There are so many styles and animations to choose from as well as many features that are super helpful as well! Thank you for making it an amazing app and having it all be free is a dream come true!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but the problem is there hasn't fast forward or start to end button if you want to go either side. I wish it will be updated with such feature and with the duration option so that it will be easier to expand clip or picture to how long an editor want it to. I hope you'll be able to notice my suggestion. Thank you and more power, God bless!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"BEST EDITING APP I'VE EVER TRIED!! I SWEAR!! this was recommended to me by someone and I was hesitant at first but I tried it and it's good!! I just like to recommend some things, like saving a draft in the app after saving it in your phone. and adding a search bar when finding music that's in my phone already. but I'll give five stars because it doesn't really lag and has no ads, plus it's a high quality app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is probably the best app for editing I've downloaded here in playstore. However, I would suggest some improvements to make. For example, choosing music is kinda hard since you will need to scroll fat especially when you have large music. I suggest to add a search bar to make it easier. Also me have problems with the voiceover since the video cannot play while you are talking which is kinda hard timing wise. Nevertheless, still a good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's so easy to edit with it and I used it on my roblox videos! Only recently, though, when i put more than 1 overlay on a video it starts to glitch everything and I have to restart. Also, when I add more than one animation to the text, the text either vanishes or glitches and shakes uncontrollably. Please fix this! I checked on my older videos and the same thing happened."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is my main form of editing videos as a content creator and I've used it for over a year. Since the last update I haven't enjoyed the new text box system. I can't delete the ""enter text"" from the box and it will double type words in boxes. I'm not sure if anything else has changed since the update. I love working with the app normally and it's easy to use and edit with. Generally positive but let down by the most recent update"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have a suggestion. If you could, please add an 'Import Fonts' on the Text section. I saw so many effects that could make editing easier. For example, the wavy effect. Since not all of us are IOS users, we can't use the apps that those people use to edit the wavy texts. But with CapCut, we CAN use it. AND we don't have to download so many apps! We just have to click the animations section. However, the fonts are limited. That aside, CapCut is a great app! Thank you and keep up the good work! üíö"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely amazing! Easy for use and beginners, variety of stuff to choose from, a tutorial, some audio choices that give you a copyright piece to do so. The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is due to the fact if you put to many screenshots in edit/adjust certain filters to much it will start to lag. That's the only negative part! SUPER RECOMMENDED!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has a lot of epic effects, but when you add them to the video, the app more often than not freezes. I had a clip that I was editing and as soon as I went to put a light effect to the clip, the entire app lost its motion. It's stuck even though I closed it and uninstalled and reinstalled it. I hope the developers are attempting to fix this because it doesn't seem to be achieving its desired purpose at the moment."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for editing but missing a lot of potential. There is so much that could be added especially for the effects. Unfortunately, most of the effects are that of which you'd never use unless you were a child trying to make a gacha edit. Prequel has more decent effects. There's a lot of transitions that don't look that good but are usable. The fonts are good, though if you have a specific one in mind, you'll have to import it. Overall, it's easy but essentially a starter editing program."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good I use it to edit my YouTube videos. The only thing this app lacks is the ability to import fonts. I have certain fonts that I like to use but I can't add them using this app so I need to use a different app for that and it's a hassle. Hopefully, you can add this feature as well and I will consider this app the best for video editing. Also there are times the app lags specially the audio and the transition from one clip to the other. I hope you can fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this app is SUPER AMAZING! I love that it has so many features and transitions and if u add more to that, its free!!:) but the only thing that I'm disappointed about this app is that I couldn't use videos that I wanted to! (they were in my photos library and I have no idea why it didn't work). maybe it's because of the time limit thing, but it was like totally not 15 mins long! no pressure, but pls try to fix this! thx:)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update, the quality of the exported video drastically dropped. It's still possible to render in 1080p, but the bitrate is too poor now. Don't get me wrong, that was/is the best video editor app, totally free, no watermarks, easy to use... but this update just change the way I use... actually I'm not using anymore, and I hope they fix this problem, cause I really like Capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This editing app is very good, recommended for beginners.. but there's only one thing I hate in CapCut. 1. Automatic cinematic bars. Frankly I don't like cinematic bars at all. This is so annoying because everytime I export a video, this will happen. I am very used to it since the problem has appeared at first, but on second thoughts it still annoys me. 2. A problem with the mic section. Sometimes, CapCut won't record my voice even though I am sticking my nose to the phone. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app it has allowed me to make some really cool stuff for tik tok but it has some issues from time to time as an example I can't import all of my tik tok sounds for some reason I'm assuming it's a bug but other than that it's great. I would love to see a version of this app for my laptop then I could make some awesome YouTube videos and actually have the storage space for it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I mean it's a great app, very easy to use! I just have one problem maybe if they can add more things. Like After Effects, it's very hard to use but i see alot of After Effects users have great things in it. CapCut is amazing but maybe have some things After Effects has?? Or maybe more things that pop the video, like colouring for the video. Like the grey parts, sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm saying I'll give it a 5 if there were more things After Effects has. SORRY if I'm comparingüíñ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, it works. It has some pretty cool assets and features, but adding an option for premium ruins the uniqueness of CapCut, and makes it just like any-other editing app. And that's why liked CapCut, because it was not. I gave it 3 stars because when I add a video overlay it freezes the overlay, so I only see about half before the remainder of the overlay is frozen and stuck. I don't understand. Even when I put a video in a different project to split it does the same thing for any video."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and it's really easy to edit with, but I didn't give it 5 stars because when I import screenshots that I've taken, it makes them smaller instead of fitting them so it takes up as much space as possible, so now I have to resize each photo to be big enough to fit the screen. It's kind of annoying so I can't really make edits anymore because it looks weird, as the size changes because I can't make them all perfect. I've also tried changing the format and it doesn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! No ads, no asking for money, and really easy to use! But there is only one problem with it - you can't have layers. This is very important in video editing, but we can make do by downloading the project and making a new one. However, not all of us has the space for that so hopefully they can update capcut to include it. But either way, Capcut is great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. No reverb effect for the audio track. 2. Zoom-in effect blurs the transitional stages of the image, instead of just enlarging them. This effect also goes WAY too fast. 3. Fade-out effect gratuitously desaturates the colors, instead of just fading out the image. 4. No interface dark theme. 5. Does not respond to user feedback. 6. TikTok personal data security risk!"

When I delete that image to try again, the video plays even though the video is paused. When I click off the project and come back it shows the images, but not at the top, it just has the ending screen. It's impossible to work on this phone, but I can get it to work just fine with no issues on other devices. Please fix this I will be ok reinstalling."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Um... yes. There is an issue with the audio system because it doesn't show all the the songs and audios I had in my device. And it doesn't give the same audio quality if I make it into a video in another editing app and extract the audio into my project. It just reduce the volume and lessens the quality of it. Please fix this! Some people may agree with me because it is annoying and ruins the experience
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great App, please don't change too much or else you will lose your target market. To developers, you solved problems that consumers wanted answers in, an app with option: with or without watermark, app with a lot of great features, and many more. Please don't change what makes you unique or else you will definitely lose your users/consumers. I used to edit my videos professionally with my laptop and now you solved all the inconveniences I had. Thank you very much. ‚ù§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I‚Äôve been using this app for some time now, and I can say it‚Äôs the best in its category. With its free cool transitions and video effects, this app does a decent job taking your mobile video editing to a whole new level. Sometimes, it could glitch and crash. You can remedy that by ensuring you have enough memory/storage space. Aside that, it‚Äôs cool."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app a lot but every time I downlod an effect or filters I have to download again after I reopen the app which has become quite annoying. And it gets laggy when I add certain effects at preview and I have to close the app. Other than that, overall, a great app. It's my favourite editor at the moment mostly because I can do a lot really easily. Would be nice to see more funny effects like distortions. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since 2020. And it's all good, no issues or bug. But lately as usual i export the video as 1080p and set it to higher frame rate to make it smoother, it didn't come out well. When i open my gallery or posting on tiktok, the video was lagging and only playing in some parts. I have check my memory or storage and it's all good. Since 2 years ago, this is my first bad review about this app. I hope you fix this issues. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Amazing, impressive editor. Just that there are barley any features that actually add more decent editing. Also add an option that can make the automatic captions customizable at creation like animations, fonts, etc. You should also make it so you can round the corners of images you put over the video. The blur should blur the whole screen and you should be able to blur certain things, like a blur object. You should also have a catalog of round edged object."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have issues. First, must be online to make specific changes. Second, can't adjust the timeline GUI height. There should be at least functions to either minimize or maximize it. Third, it's hard for beginners to wrap their head around on. Sometimes it's buggy that when you download assets the whole download thing just stops. Overall, a nice app if you can manage it. If you have internet issues though, don't install, as it can give you quite a pang of pain."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app and use it for editing all my yt videos, but there are a few small problems. Sometimes it doesn't show all my audio files and I can't add them to my project and lately it starts to get really laggy if the project is over 5 minutes. Other than that, this is an absolutely wonderful app for video editing and I'd highly recommend"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great, I've really evolved as an editor in the year I've been using this, but I've noticed, that now I've got a new phone, I can't adjust the effects that were adjustable on my older phone (black flash, chromatic, etc.). Great app, but one suggestion I propose to you, what if there was a search tool for the effects to make it easier to find specific effects?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Been using CapCut for a while, it's been great & never any issues until recently - in the past couple of days; it's taken to closing down when I'm in the middle of editing; whilst trying to adjust & set transition times between clips etc. It's been very frustrating. The video I'm working on is only about 1:40 long but it's taken me many hours with keep having to go back to it time & time again... I've sent a screen recording over via the feedback section for help...ü§û"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app. But ever since I got a new phone, CapCut has been glitching out. My text will glitch out, and instead of it saying the lyrics of the song it will say some weird computer code. My edits and animations aren't saving properly. It pains me that I'm not giving this a 5 star, but please fix this bug, it's really painful to go back in every time I want to edit and have to re-write all the text and other things I put it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! But sometimes when i want to add more than 4 overlays it crashes, so please try to fix that. And i also would love more music in the library‚ú® I would also prefer more sound effects like walking,running, or grabbing! That would be much easier and i wouldn't have to download it from a different app all the time.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the best editing app I know of, many cool features like creative 3d transitions and stock sounds. My only complaint, however, shall be the fact that there's this one video I'm editing and for some reason every time I open it to edit, all the overlay layers are misplaced from their specific places. It's a bit annoying to put them all back and edit the entire thing whenever I try to edit my video (it's 7mins long btw(does the lenght have to do with this??))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing for editing and i have posted a lot with it! But there's a problem...I made a video a while back , and it isn't far into my camera roll but it's blocked off. It's like whatevers deep into my camera roll i cannot use and that's definitely a problem. And i would say , they should add more shake effects for the animations , but make the shakes really aggressive >=) Another problem , when i make a large video with screenshots , and i leave it there for a while , it deletes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Great options, and amazing transitions! I do suggest a couple things though. Maybe you could add a stroke option such as an outline, or a border? And maybe more candy style features as well? I would have gave a 5 star, my I wish there were more options:( it's pretty limited, because most of the transitions are the same. But other then that, I have a 4 star rating! Great app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is one of the best editing apps I have ever used . The only problem is that when I wanted to edit on the app I needed to log out and login but I wasn't seen the icon to use for it, please fix it and also for the effects and other things on the app that needs you to pay for it, please put it that when you have data you can watch an add and get that effect or filter for 24 hours. Except for that, the app is great. Thank you üòä."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello! I give this app four stars ONLY because of the audio. There's not many good options when I'm trying to look, and my TikTok won't connect to this app, so I either A. Need to find a video on tiktok that has the sound I want, save it to my phone, and extract it. Or B. Somehow download some audio. Also, sometimes videos get choppy for 2 reasons, changing quality to 1080p, and if audio is in a vid (already), and I use transitions. Other than that, I'd be five stars. PLEASE fix this, CapCut!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it works great.. WHEN IT WORKS. as of writing it, it is NOT working. it's getting extremely frustrating, because no matter what i do the app will relentlessly crash. add in an overlay? crash. add in an import? crash.

I really love this app and hope for the text to go back to normal soon üò•"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing. There are so many options even without paying a single cent. I cannot begin to describe how user-friendly this app is. The features are displayed in icons that are simplistic and easy to understand. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê You can crop, adjust the brightness, saturation, temperature, hue, sharpness, and more on your videos. An incredibly wide variety of transitions, frames, and effects to make them look exciting or more eye-catching. You can add filters to adjust the overall mood."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's great! perfect for beginners at editing. My problems with it though, is that you can't create your custom transitions, there's no graphs etc. it's nice if you could advance your options similar to alight motion, video star, funimate and even cute cut. I get more satisfaction when working really hard and taking time on my transitions than having presets. Anyways, keep up the good work!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is one of the best editing app i've ever used. It has a lot of accessible feature and easy to use, unfortunately since the latest update it has been lagging a lot. I can't continue editing the vid because it won't play, I also can not edit a vid because it said that the file has been removed which it hasn't. So I really hope you guys can fix that cause this is a really great app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for more than a year, and it had become my favourite editing app. But the recent updates made me think twice, it used to be free but now it has premium features(I understand that they need to earn money but the app's main reputation is the ""easy and free editing app"") Also, I've been noticing a lot of issues and bugs while editing, sometimes the smooth slowmo won't work, or the clips won't show up. Sometimes the app is very laggy to the point where i can't use it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works great in a lot of ways, there are plenty of neat options to edit and stuff, but I'm giving it three stars cause there's literally no way to change text opacity?? Which seems ridiculous to me. I can't find a single option for changing the opacity or adding any effects that give the appearance of changed opacity. Idk if it's an issue with my app or if they really don't have this feature, but because of this I'm having to switch to a different video editing software."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is amazing, but I have one thing. It will beat alight motion.. So, many people find it annoying how you can't put an IN transition with a LOOP transition on a text. Example that's happening with me right now: Let's talk about how I want to do the animation loop, flood light and the inhale in transition, after the in transition comes in, it does the looptransition. It makes it look cheap. I'd prefer the loop and in transition go at the same time. Suggestion that I would be highly grateful 4!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is pretty good although I wish you could nudge clips kind of like in canvas when you add text. It's so hard to make cuts on a specific frame in a video you're editing. You just have to keep trimming the clip until you're satisfied with how it was cut which it doesn't have to be this difficult. I just want a button where I can go through videos frame by frame Edit: Also I hate how much space the app takes up. Literally took up 8.3 GBs
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"been using this app for videos and presentations for a while now. it's great and all, except on some slower devices like Android. everytime I try to edit clips to make them on beat, the clips end up being wrongly timed since either the audio glitches, the editing is too laggy, or the video clips have glitched. which kinda makes me feel off since I'm a perfectionist. not bad for editing, but I just wish it was easier to run."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing editing app, I think it is very underrated! You see lots of (not being mean) bad edits made on capcut but I believe once you get the hang of it the edits made are incredible!! There is also no ads! I dont remember a time I've been shown an ad while editing or even just on the app!!! I definitely recommend this to anyone learning to edit or just want to find a good editing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a really good app. It has alot of filters, effects, styles and more. Its a good thing too that capcut has a smooth slow-mo now. I gaved it a four-rating star since of the blue line thingy on the edges. Everytime I adjust it it always moves itself because of the blue line thingy. I would be happy if the blue line got removed. But I know that servers in capcut will get a bug and may take some errors when the blue line thingy is removed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used multiple mobile editing apps, and this is the best one I've ever used. Compared to all of the others I've used, its truly the most amazing editing app ever, its easy to use, and there are a variety of settings, details, and transitions. Everything works out smoothly and fast, and i love that because i am an extremely impatient individual. This is a great app, i absolutely love it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I make this review when this app is small, now that it's kinda popular and it's been a while. Capcut is a good editing app if you know how to use it, you can simply search tutorial on yt. But sometimes when I'm putting the music it doesn't load, i refresh the app and there's none. Restart my phone and none. After like 10 trys it appears, no big deal but it's kinda annoying. Pls fix the bug. I don't have anything to say more, my experience is great. I'll edit again if needed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app was okay but not my favorite. If I'm editing a short video it works but if I'm editing a video that 5 minutes and up it doesn't save. I could wait 10 minutes for a 6 minute video to save and then it tells me ""could not save your video"". Its really annoying. Another bad thing is once you make your edited version of the video if you delete the pictures/videos you had in it, It deleted the whole video. But overall editing short videos is fun and easy. But it's not my favorite video editor"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app & all. But there ºs an issue that makes my editing 10x hard. Please fix it, it would be a big help. I get stressed over it n eventually give up that ºs why I have so many undone edits. I ºm not sure if it ºs only me though, but still. I always rely on it, on the preview the edit is on beat & okay, but when I export: the audio isn ºt in sync with the edit. I make of new projects to adjust, but it ends the same. I have to export the whole edit every adjust Just to see the results"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's the best edit app I have ever seen, I love the effects and stickers that I can't even choose between them, however I have one problem and it's with slow motion, I'm sure it's not the worst but definitely not the best, pls make it smoother ... edit: I can't believe it! It's not allowing me to use stickers or efects or any other things, it keep saying no wifi and check your connection but it's 5G , I tried with vpn, I reinstalled it, I restarted my phone but nothing works!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the capcut application, this application makes it easy for people to edit videos. There are many features in this app that perfectly support different themes in your videos, as well as lots of cool templates and animations that are very trendy right now that you can use. This application can also make someone interact with other people easily by commenting and allows us to learn many things. And the most important thing is for beginners who want to edit videos this is the right app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for around 8 months (a year maybe), I love every feature, all of it, however since the last update, when I'm editing the video it doesn't run as smoothly as before and sometimes the video freezes even though the app is running. When I import it, everything's perfect but it's so annoying when I'm editing, please fix this, I will appreciate it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, CapCut is amazing. It gives alot of possibilities and delivers great service. Its good to use for overall video editing and Music Edits for for example, Tiktok. But I have a small complaint to make. I was experimenting with the overlay feature and discovered a bug. I had 4 overlay layers. I split one of them and put a filter on one of the split parts. This is where the bug occurs: The split overlay part that you put the filter on, dissapears. The clip is still there but its invisible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 3 years now, I think this app is amazing, it's easy to use and has a lot of cool effects, however, there are some small bugs I don't like, for example, when you add an overlay or sticker, you're not able to move it how you'd like, it's pretty frustrating. Another thing is ""capcut pro"" effects not showing up for me, I'm not sure if it's the device I'm using but either way, for others, there's ""capcut pro"" effects which I didn't even know existed until now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app with great features, though some recent updates have messed with the consistency of how good it is. Three or four updates ago I could not use effects without it turning into a rave with the screen flashing very fast. It got fixed in the next update, thanks for that, but in this new update, I can't even open up Capcut to see what's new. Still very useful, but not useful when it doesn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE THIS APP. It's so easy to make edits. Pre-set transitoons, great effects, filters, etc. The only reason why I am giving this a 4 star rating is because it gets really laggy when adding very short videos together or adding a lot of effects. Please fix this, its getting kind of annoying. Other than that, keep up the good work :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would have given 5 stars if there wasn't this issue. It has the option to use tiktok sounds and I love this feature. Problem is that I have my account connected, but the sounds aren't the sounds that I actually have saved on my account. When I save a new audio it doesn't transfer to CapCut under saved. Also when I use the sound in editing it cuts off the last few seconds. I would use this feature more if it wasn't as buggy. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's so easy to use and there are so many cool effects,animations and tons of cool features. Although there is a bit slight problem about it. Whenever I use too many effects and overlays it starts to lag and because of that I can't edit videos & pictures on beat, it's always off beat since my capcut is so laggy, therefore I will rate this app only 4‚òÖ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's an OK editing platform. There aren't a lot of bugs for me, but the text editing platform is really complicated aswell as the kayframe is a bit irritating. The key frame moves where it thinks you want the picture, instead of where it's supposed to go,and the text format makes it hard to copy and paste texts aswell as adjust the format of them. It would've made it 10√ó easier if they kept the old format but just added on, instead of switching it all. Now it's too complicated.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the different options and effects. The only reason why I'm giving it a four is because sometimes I'll be filming a video and it glitches and is still playing but isn't recording. It's very frustrating, especially when you're almost done with a video. I have a really bad phone, but it makes my phone slightly leggy sometimes. I would still recommend."

I uninstalled the app-it doesn't work... hope you can help me :)"

Theres just one tiny thing bothering me though: it takes WAY too long to reverse a clip. It takes me five whole minutes to reverse just about 3% of a clip! I'd suggest next time this app is updated that this be fixed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi developer, the app was great, you can use different of varieties of animations, transition, frames and such for free! This app was way too good that it made me decide to not uninstall this but there's one problem, I've been using this app for months then I was downloading different effects when this app suddenly crashed. The effects did not show up and it just crash. Yes, this app is pretty good but its performance lately made me a bit disappointed. Hope you can help me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i love using capcut to edit videos for tiktok! it's a pretty easy app to learn and it's so cool. i do wish there were more transitions and text effects, though. my main problem is that sometimes when i use smooth slow mo, it changes the color of the clip. it usually gets darker or lighter. it looks really weird. it only happens sometimes. however, it always happens to every clip when i reverse it. whenever i reverse a clip, the lighting/coloring changes. please fix this. keeps crashing!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall, good and really helpful. No watermark? That's a total win for me. The only thing is not enough is the effect, transition, animation, font, etc are limited. And somehow it kinda difficult to edit a music by making it faster/slower, cut and crop etc. Beside all of that, it already perfect for me because of free apps with no watermark."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely fantastic app: loads of great effects, it is easy to use, there are loads of great tools (for free!!!), ect. You can make cool/ really complicated edits, or keep it simple and just cut or add transitions to your videos. There is also no watermark put over the video, just a little thing at the end which is optional and can be trimmed off easily. You can choose what quality to render it- it is very customisable and professional. Five stars isn't enough, I'm so great for this app :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This just happened to me a while ago and I'm absolutely furious about it. I was editing an almost 20 minute long video for more then 2 hours. I was almost done editing, until my phone shut off for no reason. When I opened CapCut again, my project was corrupted. A lot of people are experiencing the same thing, and all the developers are doing is just focusing on premium when no one is gonna buy it. If this is not fixed sooner, then I'll have to use a better app thats doesn't have problems."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this is a really nice editor, especially to be used on a phone. I like to use it when I'm bored to make some templates, or to edit a quick photo montage when I don't have enough for it to be worth putting into my main video editor on my PC. I think it has a lot of nice tools to make quick edits that are visually appealing, but I have to say I was very upset when I opened the app today and got an ad after exporting my video, since there didn't use to be.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm so disappointed. I've been using this app for 3 years now and i am really upset to the fact that i barely used this anymore, i've got a few problems with the app and this is my precise problems. First is, when i use the smooth slow-mo feature thingy, it doesn't load up! Second, the app itself crashes when i'm in the middle of editing causing it to reset, thirdly, it lags so much that i have to delete and re-install it. Please fix this, overall.. Its overwhelming but still nice to use.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app don't get me wrong. I've been using it for 3 months and have made so many edits but my problem with it is when you have an edit with a lot of effects and splits it won't export. It will get to about 17% and it will take me to a gray screen and then to a loading screen. I've been trying to export my video for 1 hour. Sometimes I spend more than 3 hrs on these edits. It's a great app without a watermark but I absolutely cannot export edits with lots of effects .
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app to be honest. However, i encountered glitches and i find it hard to edit. first is in the audio editing section. When you cut the imported audio and drag it, the display did not align with the exact place you dragged the cutted audio. Same goes with the effects. Second is the delay when changing the slides after exporting the video. changing slides were smooth while you were still editing but after you export the vid, the transition goes off the beat. it doesn't follow exact timing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is okay overall, however, the last three days my videos started freezing and the app would just close them. Moreover, I cant download my works at any quality or frame rate. My videos aren't containing a lot of effects, they are about 10-20 seconds long. My phone is perfectly fine, I doubt it has something to do with the situation. Fix that, please, because I am unable to do something with it. I've already tried closing, re-downloading the app and resetting my phone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm tired of having to use up all of my space trying to make one video. First I can make my green screen part perfectly fine, I can even export it. I can even put it on top of videos. But when I look at the video the green screen part either skips some things I worked hard on. Or one part will start over and over again. It's making me frustrated, and if I can't use this app then I might as well use alight motion. Fix this problem, I really love the app. I make all of my videos on it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing app. I've been using this ever since. However, there is one problem that irritates me. When I'm adding text and using the Fade In and Fade Out animation, it doesn't show the Fade In and Fade Out animation at all. Instead, it's showing a different animation and I even tried uninstalling it and install again but it's the same thing again. Both Smartphone and PC version of this app have the same problem. I hope you get to fix this sooner or later."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really easy editing app! I really like it. It's easier to use and has nice effects! This app i recommend for people who need to edit a class presentation or a project or when you just want to edit your animation! The only reason i gave it four stars is because whenever i play the video to see how it looks so far, it always lags whenever it gets to the effects parts. Could you fix that please?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and it is great for making movies and is very user-friendly. However, in my movie when two black bars on the side showed up it was playing some scene in the movie and it went from black to that scene over and over again and it really bugs me. And whenever I hit fullscreen and try to rewind or fast-forward it takes me to the scene I was just at and I have to scroll through every frame and it takes FOREVER. So can you please fix those glitches please and thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the best video editing app you can get for free on Android. This review was originally about a catastrophic bug but that's fixed now. So what do you get for free? It can edit video, paste animated gifs over MMO Chatboxes, overlay video/audio, and change video aspect ratio. What's the catch? The app wants to be another video-based social media platform for the cool kids, so it's a pain to find a normal crossfade, the app asks for an optional sign-in, and it sends promotional notifs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would put 4 or 5 stars if it had a feature where you can see which images use pro features, because it would not just be useful, it would make it easier to find the one so the pro feature can be removed without needing to trough every single image of an 2 and a half minute video which is based on pictures. I hope you add this feature, it makes it easier to check things for videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. But could use a bit of adjustment. The tracking isn't perfectly usable. As it's a bit buggy here and there. Also. Integrate a feature or extension to allow For searching images/gifs directly through the app using Google. And make chroma key usable in gifs. The texts also get a but buggy when copying so maybe fix that. Other than that. It's a great app and amazing considering how it's free to use.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easiest to navigate software I used. Only problem is the reverse button. Several things have happen. All happened at different times. Either it just fails after waiting 10 minutes. Stays at zero%. And then the latest thing which has made me delete the app, the reversed clip then just turns black, nothing is there. I check opacity and nothing, I upload it and it's still blacked out. I would love to edit without worries again, so if someone could check into this, I'd come back as a loyal user."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I desperately need you to answer my question. I've updated Capcut to its latest edition, and yet my motion blur doesn't work. It's there, alright. The icon is there. I can adjust the blend and stuff. But it's just a fade in and out transition. It's not smooth like what i see on other people's capcut. i own two phones, and both of them has motion blur in capcut that doesn't work. Please tell me what I'm doing wrong."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works pretty well however I'll be making a video and all of a sudden when I'm trying to review it I find it all laggy so when I'm finished everything will be in the wrong place which I find very annoying, please fix the lag. Otherwise the app itself is pretty fun with tons of effects to use and very good for editing. I'd give it four stars besides the lagging."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is, in my preference, the best mobile video editing app that can be accessed in both iOS and Android devices. I use this app for editing my videos for my academics and social media. I don't find it difficult to use unlike the other editing applications. It incorporates multimedia elements such as text, audio, video, and image. Capcut offers and supports a wide range of editing tools. Although it is a very convenient application to use for editing videos, it has its downsides like lagging."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has been a good editing app. However, I've been facing annoying issues lately. Whenever I use template and add videos there, upon exporting it will just crash then proceed on going back to the main screen. On the other hand, when i do succesfully export it, the video will just be plain black (it has music but just plain black background). It's annoying. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall pretty good, but auto snapping needs some major major work. The snapping can be incredibly frustrating both for text and for the timeline. Sometimes it isn't even clear what it's snapping too which makes it incredibly annoying. Seriously though it is insanely aggravating because there is no option to turn it off. So some nuances are simply impossible with the current snapping."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"capcut is an amazing app, but there's still some bugs i'd like fixed. especially the audio. i can't export audio from videos through my gallery and i have to do it manually. the blue part (tracking??) doesn't match with the actual audio, and it's really annoying. and lastly, words in texts that's suddenly repeated, which i have to correct over and over again. capcut has always been the app i've used for video editting, and i'm happy with all the new updates but i hope you can fix these problems."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love all the feature... Maybe not all of them because I haven't tried some. But it's frustrating that the app is too LAGGY. I thought since I'm using a brand new phone, the experience would be smooth. Please fix this. Edit: For me, I found an issue in the sound feature of the app. Sometimes I couldn't find the new record in the platform aside from d old ones I already deleted. And now I don't what happen why I couldn't hear the sound which is opposite when I tried a diff editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Happy that they took feedback and added smooth slow mo and graphs. But please I beg you to add an option if you wanna turn on the auto adjusting for the text, I always try to move the text and it just moves it for me and doesn't place it the way I want it to. It makes me rage so much and annoys me. Please make an option to turn in on or off. But overall I love it ü§çüíó"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The GREAT editing app, I have been using this for a year, but anyway, here's my feedback: The app has everything you need for editing, I MEAN EVERYTHING! BUT, I have a small problem. Whenever I edit a video or a photo, if I have many overlays, texts and etc. It gets really laggy. Laggy to the point that I can't even see if my editing is good. I have to export it first, and If there's a problem, I will have to go back to where I came to fix it. Please fix this to ensure proper editing. Thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good editing app and has proven superior to many others. However one issue i am experiencing is terrible lag. To the point where my whole video stops rolling for about 5 seconds. It makes things incredibly difficuly. Also a suggestion i have is a moving crop? So for example lets say i have a video but there is an object in that video i want to focus on. Maybe give an option for the crop to move and focus on the object i need it on. But yeah overall really good app, just laggy"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This editing app is awesome! They have many different effects, filters and loads more. But you could be wondering why I gave it a 4 star? Well it's cause sometimes I go on the apo for example to edit a tiktok video or anything right, and it bugs out and kicks me out the app! Also it lags alot so I have to re-install it all the time! It gets quite annoying but apart from that it's an amazing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is basically completely free, you can buy a pro version to get access to some more effects ect. but even in the free version there are very many choices and good results, even the watermark can be removed without payment. I personally haven't found a better editing app that offers so much without charging money. Easy to use and if you know your way around you can absolutely compete with other ""expensive"" editing apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Easy to use than alight motion and also not confusing. The only problem is that sometimes i crash and lag so much that sometimes my phone just freeze for a few minutes. I hope you can fix this and also this is a good app to edit and do something and you can draw here too! But its kinda hard to draw in there but its still good! Anyway sorry if my Grammar sucks. I hope y'all have a great day!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There was a bug that happened where my pcitures were all over the place, but that is fixed and I love this app. Its pretty simple and easy to use, has all the things neccasary to edit videos and images to create a video. Somethings you could add though is more transitions and animations that would be so so helpful. Other than that, great app totally recommand."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey CapCut, I just want to say that this is a great app and works really well, I love it a lot. But I have have a few issues, recently when I've been opening the app and want to go get photos, videos and photos don't load at all. I've tried closing and reopening the app and it's still not loading, do you or anyone else know what might be happening?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is terrible. It used to be so much better. When you export a video, it runs perfectly fine. But if you import the same video back, a very good chunk of the video is cut out and it's stuck on the same frame. Tried remaking the file twice, to no avail. Tried freeing up storage. To no avail. Tried uninstalling smd reinstalling the app. To no avail. Fix your app, devs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, i use it to make my edits. I just feel as if it needs more to it though. We need to be able to group things together like 2 (or more) clips as 1 in the same project without exporting or anything for less space to waste. More better filters and effects. Can look into another editing apps and get ideas to think of better filters, effects, and even transitions. Other than that, the app itself works pretty smoothly, though it can have times even it lags a lot."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. And as the others say. Yes. They have a variety of options and animations. I have been editing with this app for almost a year now and I love this and enjoy it very much but you see I have one major problem. Actually, two. First of- the lag. Whenever I put too much overlay it lags and I can't put any more animations and it closes the app. Second is a glitch where when I try to input an overlay everything goes black and I have to restart the app. Please fix this. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great editing and video making app, except I have two problems. The first is that it gets extremely laggy after putting in over a dozen videos/screenshots and I lose the ability to finish the project quickly. The second problem is that I cannot use the text animation feature because I says I'm not connected to the Internet. I know for a fact that I am because I can use other features that need Internet that work perfectly fine. Please fix those problems. But overall, the app is decent."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app and has a lot to offer but unfortunately half the time the app can't even run properly. It's freezes, glitches, and some options crash the whole app regardless of what phone you have. I've been using it for a while but now it's become unbearable and hard to use. I recommend alight motion for better quality and better performance."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app, one of the best (if not the best) for android users. Once you get he hang of it so much is possible and ready waiting for you. The transtiotons you can mix together and experiment with, the same with the animations. The effects are simply beautiful and can mse your edits look amazing. Overlays and text overlays are wonderfully made. Keep up the work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great but the thing is that I was editing a video with pictures. I haven't done so I didn't export the video but I moved the images to a different album. When I went back to edit, the images were missing and they were just shown ""The video/picture has been deleted or moved, please check your system album"". Why can't I move my images to other album? Can you please fix this so that we can move the images to a diffrent album without the images in our videos getting missing?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a higher rating except that, I cannot properly split a clip without it splitting in another place, because of the incomplete loading of where I am in the clip (What I'm saying is that I am trying to split a further part of a clip but splits in the wrong place because the seconds are not in the right place because it has not fully loaded.) It takes a while to split it normally, so I only use capcut for velocity now because of its extreme lag amongst it. Although, it is still good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great üëå really nice effects and great animation. But recently the app has had a few problems I didn't know if it was just phone so I bought a tablet and it still acting strange. When ever I do a video it freezes up mid way it won't let me export at 1060p the transition/video would just freeze even after I export it. This only started happening after the recent update üòü but I hope this gets fixed because this app is really good one of the best I've edited with.üòî
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazingly free and I almost can't believe something like this exists. From its endless animations, FX, and powerful tools given without limits, this app is undeniably the best out there. Although it has minor lags here and there like, when editing longer projects especially with filters and music, doing quick transitions, and a few other things, it still does the job incredibly well than any app I've tried. Would definitely recommend this to anyone getting into editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Has been my go to but now it's not working. It's not an update issue I don't think but now randomly the audios in app will be all chopped up. If I download the video it's fine but if I try to put it on tiktok it ends up chopped up as well and I can't find a way to fix it(as just uploading the downloaded capcut video also causes the audio distortion). I've tried several templates over the past day or so and had the exact same issue. And it's not my phone so I'm really confused.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is overall very good and easy to use! However it gets laggy with long videos, and it NEVER updates on the audio in my device! I have to make the audio a video somewhere, and then use the extracted audio instead of only importing the audio file I have before because it never updates or shows up! It's very annoying, and I hope it could be fixed soon, as I've had this problem for a long time now :( I have a Samsung."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, in my opinion it is the best editing app. one small issue, there is a problem with trimming your gif/video, and it's about the start time. if you split or trim a gif to change its start time, it will not work, and there is no use for it. please fix this. otherwise I really love this app and have no other issues. I've tried many other editing apps bit tjis is the best one ever. favorite editing app, if the trimming/spitting issue didn't exist I would've given it 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's mostly great, useful features & easy to use. But the main issue I have with it is that whenever you try to drag anything on the screen (video/image, sticker, text) it locks up & clicks to the most RANDOM places & it's very difficult to get the placement of things how I want it bc of that. So that's very frustrating. Hopefully you'll fix this sooner than later. One more thing, I wish there were settings for notifications in the app so you can turn off certain notifs, but keep others on."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app would be my go-to if it didn't lag so much. I barely have to edit anything for it to start lagging. I was forced to switch over to the PC version, which is really good cause it doesn't lag, but it doesn't let you change the graph for the keyframes. Only the mobile version let's you do that. So whenever I want to use that feature, I have have to use the mobile version and just deal with the lag."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome free video editing app with lots of features and works really well for me. May not be the simplest, but if you used other video editing software before this will be very easy and familiar to you. There is a good variety of effects and transition animations and so on. The audio can be edited to a degree as well. No ads in the app and no watermark. I think they do have an option for a premium version, but as is it is very usable. Not much more to say. Just a good video editor. Try it out."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wouldnt recommend it because it lags a lot when you try to replay your video while editing so you can't get a clear view of how the video will turn out. I had to keep exporting the video to see if i had to change anything. And also if im uploading a video to edit and want to make it portrait size and zoom in to what i want to edit, the quality is horrible. I always download my videos in the highest quality but it still turned out bad. Other than that, it has pretty good features for no premium"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just started using this app and I really like it. However, it says that two of my edits are deleted even though i didn't delete them. Yet, both edits are in my gallery and it plays perfectly fine. And also it keeps saying check network connection even though the wifi is working perfectly fine. I will change my review if I see an improvement."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Now I changed my review. I now rated it 3 stars 'cause I have TWO problems. When everytime I edit a video, the video just freezes but the music is still going. I don't know if it's a bug or something, 'cause we have a stable Wi-fi. And the second thing is when I exported the video, the quality is a little bad. I've been using this app for like 2 years, and I don't want to uninstall it 'cause I really loved it before. Pls fix my problem. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a pretty good app, but for some reason the mega bites (MB) for the app keeps going up even though I don't use it often. There's also a ton of bugs and glitches, one of the ""video filters"" just makes my phone lag's even though my phone's RAM is high enough. Overall pretty good app there's nothing wrong other then the lack of bugs and glitches. 8/10"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"CapCut has the potential to be the best video editor in the world but the devs are killing it by removing one key feature. For some stupid reason, there are no edit points on the edge of the media in the timeline, which would usually allow for precise resizing. As someone who transforms videos from Portrait to Landscape and vise versa, the lack of such a feature is really frustrating. I hope it can be added ASAP (on the desktop version too)."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, and I use it to make edits for tiktok all the time, however the reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because as of recently, it wouldn't let me add certain videos or scene packs. It would pop up saying ""compressing"" and then it would exit and bring me back to the screen where you can view all of your edits. I've updated the app, I've pressed force stop but nothing worked. It's been like this for a few days now and I've seen other people with the same problems."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm getting really annoyed when using this app, I've been considering switching to a different app beacuse whenever I add an overlay it is extremely hard to adjust to the place I want it because the app keeps trying to centre it and assumes I want it at a certain area when I don't, if you know what I'm on about then you understand my struggles and the anger I feel every time I see those blue lines, all I as is there to be a feature where u can disable it for a certain overlay. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is good but basic, which I mean are the lousy features and editing use. I recommend adding a search button for filters and you dont have to keep scrolling down. My one complaint is a that whenever I add someone to my favorites because I use it often, it never shows up, it just shows black, nothing else. These has been happening for a few months now, please fix it. Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great so many features just for free. You can even edit and adjest videos and features for free. It gives lots of opportunities to students. But one problem is a glitch or bug where when I move a text slightly so I can put in where I want it to, it moves to another spot and my other text all move to another spot where I dont want them to be."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Best editing app, but i won't give it a 5 star beacuse there is a problem during I add some body effects to the video I am editing. When I add body effects, the body movement getting slower and can't catch up or connect to the next clip because the background music timing couldn't aim the video clip. However, this application is a very big help especially in my studies whenever we meant to make some videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had little to no trouble with this app for a while, but just recently whenever I put a bunch of short clips together, it glitches that part and makes the while project off time. Now I've tried deleting the project and re-editing it, deleting the app and remaking it (this worked at first but just today it happened again). I mean the app is usually very good and easy to use but just recently I've ran into this problem and it's really upsetting me and getting me annoyed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is sooo Good and the best video editing app It deserves 5 starts or more. However the new update is awful, please bring back the sound effects üò≠üò≠ I use this app in editing my youtube videos (vlogs) and I'm having a hard time editing specially when I have to drag the text, music/sounds, filters, and other effects and overlays because it's not showing up on the right position. I hope these glitches will be fixed very soon. Thank you so much for existing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app overall, everything is free and there are no ads. But the problem for me is that it glitches BADLY. It even messes up the music and timing, so it's extremely difficult to get the timing right when it keeps glitching when I make edits. Please fix this, I have tried everything from deleting apps to clear storage and searching for possible resolutions."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the only app I could edit on without being THAT laggy, but I also need a new feature that is called 'Graphs'.I would really want graphs please so we can create our own transitions and more stuff! There's also a problem I would like to report,when I press an effect (I pressed the aura one) I couldn't play the video or edit.The effect was a good one and I wanted to use it but I can't since I'll have to restart over and over again.I don't know if it's a bug from my phone or app but pls fix"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I free up space in Google photos, suddenly most images don't exist to Capcut and I have to re-download them in order to use them, which takes up a lot of space. There's also no mesh image feature for distorting images, the pause button needs to be bigger, & video length should be displayed in the bottom right of the timeline when making it longer, so you can tell how long it is without having to stop frequently. A dark theme would also be appreciated. Otherwise, a pretty ok app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app base, but there could be some tweaks to help with quality. One of the things I would try work on is the lag when using overlays, especially multiple. Another thing is that lag gets bad when you reach the ten minute video mark with screenshots and videos. Allowing us to use downloaded audio on device ( It's sad I can't use my favorite songs). I have one more suggestion but, it isn't really important, allowing the editing screen to flip portrait or landscape."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an incredible tool for beginners such as myself to edit videos. I would like a few things for this app to be changed though, such as mask tracking. I would like the tracking effect to also be in the overlay section. Second is the automatic lock-in-place thing that happens whenever you try to move an overlay, sticker, text etc. The lock-in-place is cool but I want there to be a switch to turn that off just so I can freely move overlays."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is really cool. But, when i first downloaded it, the animations and transitions were working. Except for the effects and animations of the text. The second time i re-downloaded it, the transitions, animations, text styles, effects, and more were not loading. I keep optimizing my phone but, nothing worked. Idk if this is a bug or its just my phone, but i tried this in two DIFFERENT devices, on my other device, none of them loaded. The app might probably had bugs in it. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good and pretty simple to learn I do recommend this if it's your first time editing. But, the biggest problem I have with this app is the fact that it doesn't seem to work with my cricket phone for some reason, it heats up my phone a bit and everytime I try to export a video, it gets to at most 79 and just kicks me out to the home screen. Worse, it's having this much trouble over a video that's not even a minute-long. If you can update it to work better, I would appreciate it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good. I love the fact that we get all these features for free. But the app could use some changes, like changing the duration of all the videos/photos at once while editing. And also this new prompter feature is great but how am I supposed to use it when there's no option to flip the camera to selfie mode???????!!!!!!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It sucks that a lot of good features are not available for free, and the pro version is so expensive at least for me, there are some bugs, but the most annoying thing is, sometimes if you put text on a video it will start flashing and give me a seizure, but some positives are you can make pretty good videos with little effort, also I think the auto edit needs updated, maybe you can tell it the style you want the video in because as of right now it seems like the auto edit does whatever it wants."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a very good editing app. You can do everything like masking, velocity, shakes and so much more. But I'm not here to praise this app. I'm here with a problem to say. When I'm done editing like an edit that has lots of clips for example: I did a velocity+shakes edit and when I wanna edit it back like adding ghost effect after I exported it. It became stuck in one place. It's so annoying. Like going smoothly then stuck. It's so annoying especially if ur a capcut editor. Fix this please"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its a good app there is a lot of stuff that is in the editing program. But evrytime i click the x. I doesnt go to the menu. It adds a new one. I get really annoyed with this and unistalled the app. And once you add the editing noise/effect. It cant be moved once placed in that spot. That gets really annoying and somtimes have to restart the video that used. Please fix these. If you fix the adding a copy problem ill give it a five. And fix the moving editing line thing 4 starts. Hope you fix'em!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! But it can be a little frustrating, I'm always trying to export it I most of the time export it to tiktok,And it always says ""tiktok is unavailable"" . Other than that I get to use free edits and they actually come out decent . Their app is ok ü§†üíØ , they should totally make a professional capcut for people that wanna make their own edits ,and I know there's an option to do that but there's not many options. So all I'm trying to say is to make the app a bit better.ü§ô"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very, very well made app. I love how there is no watermark what so ever and no premium that you need to get. This helps alot of people who don't have money to pay for all the exclusive things in other editing apps that include premium. The only problem I have with this app is that it starts getting glitchy after alot of image's are on it. Also I can only have about 5 overlays so I can't tween. If you would fix this I would be very happy. Thank you for reading. Sincerely, Me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This being a ""free app"", I've just use it to adjust & add captions and text to my already trimmed videos. So I don't use it super extensively...but why would you make it super hard now to edit the text? Now, when you go to edit text, it only allows for you to do it on the video? It used to have a box where I could see it clearly, that box is now gone? Now, I can hardly see the text for captions & can't even select or edit the text without fighting to even get the cursor in the right place!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"NEW EDIT: When the app works as intended it is incredibly useful . However, I don't like being taken to the template page instead of my drafts first. Old edit: New Bug: Thumbnail title editor quits when you minimize the keyboard to edit style. New Bug:Videos are not exporting with the thumbnails. Same day. Found another bug. Videos are exporting without text at the end of videos without the proper ending. Text template end up on top of actual video not end screen."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a very good app! Amazing even but I don't know exactly what happened I had deleted it and got it back and after that every time I exported it parts of it weren't in the video. I had been using this app for a while and thats mostly the only problem I had with it but this problem makes it impossible for me to be able to put the video on to tik tok or just have it for me in my camra roll. Edit: it's gotten way more laggy now my templates also won't work and are only loading to 50%
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Super fun to use! My only problems are that I download the same video repeatedly so I can have longer & smoother transitions, instead it lowers quality of the video when it was really good quality before and it makes it blurry and pixel-like. Slow motion needs to be smoother. Sometimes video stops and doesn't play. I wish you could move overlaysz text, etc. more smoothly and the blue line isn't helpful around it. More color text pls! :) Dont like theres multiple pic/vid im using around it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EDITING APPS I'VE EVER USED. I love the effects, transitions, filters and animations! But I rated it 4 stars because I think you guys should add the speed option in the effects! For example the effect ""Astral"" in the 'Party'. The effect goes kinda fast and to match my editing. I want it kinda slow. So, if you guys add the speed option in effects, I would really appreciate it!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using YouCut for the longest time (still do), but CapCut was a nice and recent discovery. In CapCut, you can stick text on a moving object. It has more text options and better transitions. Finally the video output does not triple or quadruple in size like in YouCut. However, it's Overlay feature is not as good as YouCut's PiP. Still, easy 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was able to make one video fine. The second video forced me to delete literally every photo, game, and almost every other app off my phone to make room for it. Now I'm trying to do my third, which was supposed to be posted yesterday, and the editing process which only took me 4 hours with the first two has now taken me two days because it keeps skipping, glitching, jumping, and freezing as I'm trying to edit the voice over. I am fuming."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app for easy edits. I've used it for over 2 years now but lately it's been extremely glitchy. whenever i try to make an edit something glitches, usually a clip duplicates etc, i can't do anything to fix this. When this first happened i deketed some of my projects since i had over 200 and it worked.. once. it doesn't work anymore and I hope this issue gets fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can definitely say that CapCut is the best mobile video editor app for 2020. The effects, transitions, and filters included in this app are so good! Meanwhile, I just noticed that the provided sound effects are quite limited. I suggest that CapCut should have bigger music library. Overall, Capcut still deserved to have my 5-star review because this app truly exceeded my expectations about mobile video editing apps. I am looking forward for your newest version! Two thumbs up for you, Capcut!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for like 2 years, it seems like bugs and glitches keep growing on every update. When I add a key frame, the video previewed on the top doubles the scale. And when I open my old project I made, the images/videos kept missing. I didn't delete it, nor moved it. And when I try the reverse option, it freezes my phone, ended up waiting for half an hour to restart my phone. I'm sorry tho I'm moving to the next one üòï"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its okay, i love it. The editing effects are nice, but my phone always glitches with using it. On my phone, it never loads correctly and it always ends up off beat or something. I personally use a Samsung, which is a good phone. It runs correctly, and ive tried everything to get this app to work. I cant even edit a 5 second video without the effects being so off due to glitches. I love it, and its amazing on an iphone. But on my phone, its practically trash."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ima be honest, I used this for awhile but then the videos I was editing got moved to Google photos instead of my gallery and all the edits I did for it were gone. Its user error but still kinda sucks. The fact that it can use tiktok audios that you saved on your account is nice. Its relatively easy to understand unless you plan on doing more advanced stuff (i never tried and that kind of thing is difficult for me to get lol) Overall I do reccomend it but keep your stuff in the gallery."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was very good at first, and I made sooo much, but now it's just downgraded so much. I have been using the free version, and it's good, but it's downgraded so much. When I separate things now it's not exact, it adds about 3 milliseconds, which may not sound very much, but is actually ALOT when ur making a gacha video, for example. The writing is not exact or clear either, along with the separation. Honesty, these annoy me so much, and I'm not gonna pay knowing that it can be fine without payin"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app has potencial. its cool since it doesnt have a watermark. but theres a problem that annoys me, theres WAAY to many bugs and glitches. it makes the app so unusable, and its frustrating. and i hate how you have to hold in order to record instead of just tapping the record button, thats something that you should change. so yeah, this could of been an amazing app, but its to laggy and too frustrating to use, the app is dogshit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I lovethis app it is super easy to edit in it and great for making videos. This is one of the best Android video editors on google play. My one problem is that I was trying to edit a video that had a file size of 132mb and when I went to export it, it said it was going to take 5000mb of storage. Idk if this is a glitch but my phone doesn't have enough storage to export a video with a file size that big"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good editing app, importing fonts, easy, but my problems are when I add text in the video, it's normal yes. But sometimes when I open the edit, the text would become smaller. The same is when I insert emojis in my last text with a font and style, then insert another text it just becomes normal font so I have to put back all the settings of the last text. This app is good but I will miss it back when there was no CapCut Pro (I don't know if it's my device causing these bugs)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I might give this a 5 star review, but there are times it lags and delays the audios :(. The transitions are okay but it would be okay if it's more smoother than before edit : the app is still fine but‚Äî it would be better to add offline features (like downloading the transitions/effects) since a lot of us make edits here in capcut offline, please add this kind of feature if you have time!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i love this app very much! it's the best editing app I use to edit my videos for tiktok and Youtube. and it doesn't have the watermark that will show for the whole video! But I might suggest that you make a channel on Youtube to show everyone other features in Capcut. I can't adjust the zoom tho... For example, the zoom needs to start from my right hand to my other hand, that kind of zoom. And it doesn't have the face effects like big nose, big eyes, wobbly effect, etc. BTW thanks for the app. ILY!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a great app tbh , but 2 thing that bother me . 1- the app needs more animation effect and transition . 2 - there's 3 category for animation , i.in animation , ii. Out animation , iii. Combo animation . My problem is , instead of using combo animation , can you make so that i can use in animation and out animation on a same picture . It will be helpful for me because combo animation does not have the transition effect i needed . I hope the devoloper can change it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for editing and easy to use. However, I have recently experienced bugs in the app while editing. The app kept crashing, lagging, and unexpectedly closing while I was editing. I tried all kinds of remedies, clearing the cache, restarting both the app and phone, deleting unused videos and files, but none worked."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice but have some really annoying bugs in recent updates, - Objects like texts, photos and videos almost every object in video editor is not stable. i double check every time their place in video to be sure. - angles. It's very hard to choose 0¬∞ again if you rotate object. And some should be added details - in + out + loop animations. You can't add 3 of them both in one object and that makes little more amateur graphics. - video bitrate quality. It's not essential but adding it would be nice"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, It is super easy to understand and use. I have tried other apps but this is simply the best. I have to give it 4 stars because there are some functions I would love to see added like a way to group the overlays, more text to speech voices and 3D effects for overlays, videos and texts. Other than these I think everything else is great."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this editing app! Ive you only had it for 4 months & no bugs whatsoever the effects & animations are very good & there were no problems I'll definitely be patient if there are problems Edit2 Hi, it's been a while but I have some complaints. I cannot now see the animations, Effects, text, text template, stickers, etc. As you know I have a WiFi problem, my WiFi isn't strong because I live not so far away in my city, I can't really finish my projects & videos because of the new update Pls üîß"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because it is the best when it comes to effects and has a lot of useful features. BUT THE ONE THING, THE ONEE THING THAT'S SO ANNOYING. This one thing brings the app from 5 starr to 2 and half star. I can't open media using my my explorer. Now that would be a problem if all the videos always show up in the app. But half the time I download a video, and it doesn't show up in the app. I close and open again, even if I try to share from gallery, it just shows an error. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has come a long way and now it is what I use daily. The effects and filters are great. If I could change one thing I would make it so you can disconnect the audio from the video. I also wish they had a better music selection available but that's not a deal breaker for me. Overall it will get my 5 start review. Thank you for all your efforts to make this a viable app. Edit: April 2022 I like this app but the option to export a video to 4k is no longer there. I upgraded my phone to s22.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The best part about this app is the voice changer feature. I recently switch to another software that does not have it. I notice that even with fade in or fade out I'll hear an audio clip or glitch if I am editing something as a stitch so there is no way around the blip noise. When editing too long the clips no longer cut where you want them, this includes markers and it will shift a few seconds before. Need to export if too many overlays. Systems hates."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. I use it for all of my videos. However, the reason I gave it four stars is because of the lack of freedom when moving pictures or videos, texts, etc. Perhaps you could adjust that, or add a new category where you can adjust how high it is, or how far left or right it is without those lines that stop from doing anything. That's all I can really suggest."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i love this app for editing on tiktok! i find it a little bit annoying that, whenever i edit and i go to graphs and choose custom i have to copy it all the time in many clips that i have, why can't there be an option that saves the graph preset instead of me copying it over and over. same goes with the effects! let there be an option where you can apply to all clips instead of needing to copy it to every single clip one by one. but overall this app is good!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is one of the best video editing app I ever used! It gives you more options for everything, there no annoying ads plus, its FREE! I think you should add a feature where you can resize your blur and mosaic so that it doesn't blur/pixel the whole clip, and also add a brush so you can make your own animated stickers. I think it will give you more users. Overall, this is the best video editing app and I'm glad I discovered this app today!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would be a 5 star, I LOVE this app sm, but the text is so broken. I went to make a video and caption it myself (as my auto caption doesn't work) but for some reason three things keep happening. 1: I can't delete things because ""type here"" or something like that keeps showing up every time I press backspace 2: the text won't show up when I finish typing 3: I can't add more than one bar of text. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling rn, hope it works"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used the capcut since mid-2021.The problem that i really hate is if you accidentally drag a pic too short. I want to tap on it cuz want to delete it but the app always thought i want to give a transition. That was a very annoying problem. Overall, everything is OK. But can you put earrape bass boost effect sound? Cuz i always make funny video. I hope you can fix this issue soon and add that effect."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awsome app!! This app will catch up a beginners edit. Even though there's many bugs I still like this appüòä. But the bug it's, I was editing debates or 1v1 or something, and I was puting text shake with green screens, when I was puting the overlay it has a lot of bugs, like my overlay kinda... Blured or something, and looks even fat than than the regular one, and if I edit to much animations/too much time, it will absolutely lag for no reason! Can you guys fix this?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! The only couple of things i would say is that it starts to lag when I add ""camera focus 2"". It takes up a lot of storage in your phone if you delete the edits after you download them. Lastly, there is a limit of amounts of overlays you can add to one clip which I find annoying at times. These 3 reason are the only things that made me give it 4 stars but over all the app is quite easy to use.But that's all I have to say (follow my tiktok @.emzcc to see the edits I make with capcut)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing in every way... almost. I dont really know what happened recently but I can't compile videos that add up to more than around 5 minutes after editing. At first i could easily record 20 minute vids but now if I try that itll go through the entire ""editing process"" just to have never done or saved anything. That aside, this is a great editing app for beginners and skit makers!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I see a template that I like on tech, talk whenever I go to the template and try to use it, the sound doesn't stop, and it always just glitches, so basically. The sound in the template does not stop making the sound, and whenever I tried to edit it, doesn't stop and. Also, when I'm on my home screen, it plays the music other than that I love it, I recommend it so much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Until CapCut came around, I would spend hours in my editing booth working on editing, adding pictures & sounds, adding effects & transitions. That is a thing of the past. Although this app has put all the above-mentioned features into one easy to understand app for the ""average Joe"" (and essentially putting this artist almost out of business), I think I can forgive them, lol. CapCut has truly made my job 1,000% easier. For that, I'm forever grateful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The transitions are really amazing and spectacular! I can really use them for amazing tiktok videos and more stuffs also love the aesthetic purple filters and others! And I can use templates if I‚Äôm lazy or I don‚Äôt know what to do, I just can insert photos and export and well done! This is really amazing for people that are looking for transitions!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, great for editing short videos to show off to my friends. bit hard to get used to. Amazing features adds beautiful effects to my videos love the templates. Amazing how anyone can express themselves through this app. Though I put 3 stars because almost everything is now.. ""PRO"" I don't know where this came from but obviously you have to pay for it. It's fine but it does get in the way. Please make it so you can disable it and see (only) NON-PRO features Thank you. (;-_-)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my favourite editing app. Its literally the best when you get used to all of the options, and how to use the app. Its really great. I dont find alot of errors, well i there is one, when exporting a video i want to edit, it crashes. Idk if its my phone which is not powerful enough, or if its the app itself. This would be such a big problem if it were to happen at most time. Luckily it doesnt. Other than that, using this app has made my job, as a content creator way more easier."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is overall good, but most times it glitches and doesn't let me continue my edit. Also, when I export, at first it didn't load to a 100, and now at the end of each edit there's just flashes and not the actual clips I added. Please try to fix this in a way. After you added the pro features the app started crashing even more than before."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ngl, I wasn't expecting much from this app but hoo boy, I was wrong. The Chroma Key is very powerful for an Android app and it just runs smoothly, even with 30fps animations. Plus the amount of free available assets like fog effect is simply amazing and admirable. The only thing that can be improved is sound editing and some other minor problems. But all in all, it's a pretty damn good app. Keep it up developers!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is amazing and I use it pretty often on my tablet but lately I'll go into something and the screen will keep rotating between landscape and portrait and won't let me leave the app unless I press home and that takes forever. Please fix this bug because capcut has never done this before and I want to still use it because it's so amazing and a lot of good edits can be done using it but this bug is so annoying and I had to stop using it for a while. FIX IT PLEASE!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app! Tons of transitions and effects! I am writing this review to suggest some more features. Transitions: There's is a ton of transitions, yes, but I feel like a few more could be added into the open in ones? Effects: I really want a raindrop effects and a radio beat edge. These are just suggestions! Wonderful app all together!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It had so many potential but when editing videos, it all comes down to the user experience. Things lag constantly and the video effects doesn't help it, and the sound effects not being saved after downloading them infuriates me. There's also a bug that doesn't let you change stuff in keyframes which limits the app's usability."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is more frustrating than before, when in the middle of making another long edits, it keeps crashing and I try to restart my phone and do some edits it wouldn't work, it's goddamn stupid waste of time, yes I put it in one star because of the bugs are interrupting my edits as always, but I will change it if another update coming soon and the bug will be fixed as long as they can. Yeah that's all I can say"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would've loved to edit with this app. But, there is a big problem, at first the app was doing ok and the performance was very good. I thought I am going to be a actual professional video editor. But when I added a text and added animation into it. It started lagging and not only the text. The whole video. Same with transitions. I searched for solutions everywhere, but couldn't fix it, please fix this bug because hundreds of millions of people just can't edit videos properly because of this lag"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A good app. But there is one feature I absolutely hate. I spent days making a sally face edit and before exporting it I move the clips to a new folder for later. Then it said the clips have been deleted/removed blah blah blah. I tried for hours to get it back but I couldn't. Please please please make it so that if u move ur clips to a folder it doesn't take them away it keeps them in the edits. Also make less things for pro.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for editing videos and other things but I have an issue where when I try using a font or anything that requires internet, it says there isn't any connection even though I am connected to the Wi-Fi, I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it still shows no connection. It's getting really annoying to edit videos, I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but maybe there's something that can be done about this, still an amazing app though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great editing app, but there is one thing that I think could be improved. When you add text, there is this box that pops up that says 'recommended text placement' or something like that. Whilst I understand it's use, it also means that you can't place text in certain areas were the box's outline is. But apart from that, I recommend it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is by far one of the best video editing apps, But there's something u haven't gotten right. I work with Folders that have a lot of video and I mean a lot, up to 50 Videos. And when I want to edit a particular video that I want in such folder, there isnt a specific way to locate the video I'm looking for. There is no search bar for my files and most important the names of the videos don't even show. All we have to work with is a picture of a scene in the video. I urge you to pls fix thisüôè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This apps is really great, have been using it for 2 years. But recently I noticed something that really bothered me. They removed some very cool effects (Random graphics, wire frame, moon / heart / star projection, flashlight - to be exact) and these were really cool! Could you please add these back? They were absolutely AMAZING! ‚ú®üòî"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is hands down the best experience for the editors. What not it can offer in such a free application. That's why I'm writing here to tell the developers to improve some shortcomings like, writing animation effects ""with sounds"", it's a hassle to adjust sound effects separately. Can't adjust the color grading freely after adding key frames, apply to all should have selection option like which clips I want to apply the adjustments. Hope they'll have a look at it. thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app, have used it for around 2 years now. I have to say im very pleased, only couple of things that should get improved imo. 1. Lags in Preview at a certain point it gets difficult to tell whats going on if the entire app is just lagging. 2. Sound/music bar design the music bar design is almost impossible to work with if you have a complex beat and you wanna match it to the video"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall solid app for editing videos and pictures. Very simple to use, too. Although, most effects and animations are pro. (Extra money). There's also a glitch. On my phone, when you turn it on, there's an option to take a picture without unlocking my phone. It's very convenient. Whenever I export a video I made using a picture I took with this feature, it says that it has been deleted or moved. I don't know if there's any way to fix this, If there is, please inform me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is a good editing app... But sometimes I lag and need to restart or make a new project. It's the only thing I hate or maybe is it just my phone? It's kinda laggy, late, and when I use a new effects or smth it gets crusty and when I put too much overlays, and played it at the start of the video.. I have to wait for 2 minutes to play and when it already plays it's going fast to slow and fast to slow again. Idk if it's just me or also the others."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wasn't sponsored btw. This is WAY better than Samsung's editor. I made a ton of gifs with this. It's got collages, video effects, and other stuff. Surprisingly, the app lets us remove the ending that mentions cap cut. Finally, there are no watermarks nor adds. It's by no means as complex as premier pro but is free and fulfills my basic video editing requirements."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best app I have every used!. I use it to edit my tiktok videos. Its so aesthetic ‚ú®. Its completely free and has no water mark except for the end wich can be removed freely. It had endless filters and transitions. Has good music and you can save a sound and use it on your own if you'd like. I have never used a better app. Its not laggy and I have a Samsung to. You can edit saved videos pictures or even your screen recording videos. When I screen record its not laggy or any thing. Love this app!.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall a great app, but recently (I edit YouTube videos with it) I cannot add in audios, they just do not appear once I add them. It's weird because it never used to do that. It just happened one day. I even deleted and reinstalled the app (which erased all of my WIPs) and there was no change. It's a shame too because it's so good, but now it just doesn't work the same as it used to."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best mobile editing app in my opinion. But there are few bugs in the app that bother me when I'm editing. Like when I cut the clip in half the background music is cut for some reason. And I get a gap of music in the middle of my edit. But after I save it, the gap isn't there. This really ruins my vibe and my editing confidence, as I make beat synced videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I first started using it, I had a weird feeling about it. But, now, I'm so use to it, I just cant stop making edits. I really recommend this for beginner editors like me. Just one favor! When you put an animation on the photo, can you make it as long as the photo?( Like, let's say a photo is 10 seconds long, we can try to make the animation 10 seconds long :] )"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the best app for android atleast to edit videos. Not only does it not leave a mark for editing the video but it has some very cool features that I love. Editing isn't difficult either! I completely recommend it. Altho one feature I'd like to add is that while going through your own mobile stored music the search is kinda hard, because you have to scroll all the way. If you can add search engine there it would be appreciated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall a pretty good app to use, easy to understand, with lots of potential, and it used to be completely free. But recently you've begun to need to pay for lots of things, and they removed the ""basic"" category of video effects that include popularly used items such as the shaking camera or fisheye lens effect. You can tell that they're beginning to make the app less friendly towards users who aren't willing to or can't pay."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to change the cover of the video using the app. But now after the latest update, the finished videos would show the first shot of the beginning of the video instead of the chosen cover. It made my thumbnail looks unappealing. Putting 0.1 second clip of the cover at the start of the video is hassling bcs I could never delete the clip after that bcs it's too short."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good app, there are lots of effects and transitions, your able to slow your video down or make it faster, add writing and use different fonts, add music from video and songs you have downloaded and even more that the app provides, there is so much you can do and it's really easy to use, not to mention you can choose whether or not you want the app logo towards the end, I recommend you install this app ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I find this app brilliant! It's easy to use and simple to find things yet you can still produce brilliant edits. The only reason the last star isnt there is because I think there should be an option to turn off snapping to a point, like snapping to 0 in angles or snapping to the centre of the screen as it can get rlly annoying when using key frames"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great video editor for beginner and intermediate channels. It really helped my editing skills and was easy to use, a bunch of cool features. Almost a 5 star, it is just missing a few more features like being able to not just have text track something but also overlays and images. If there were also a few more stickers, that would give this a 100% 5 star review"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use both the Android and Laptop version. But I've been having trouble importing audio (on the phone version specifically)! Sometimes it works like a charm and other times it says that (IT DOESN'T SUPPORT). The audio formats I use are mp3 and Wav. Sometimes they import so I can edit and sometimes they aren't supported. I really like this app so if it can be improved in that specific area I'd be very thankful! Have a nice day.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this video editor and wished it was on oc, but that's not the reason it gets 3 starts. I love this video editor but I have the setting set to 1080p and when it finishes rendering it looks more like 720p or 480p. Besides that I love this app, it has great effects, transitions, and is very easy to use. Please fix the quality, after that this will definitely he 5 star"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its the BEST editing app I've used so far, WAY easier than using my previous editor-app called ""Kinemaster"", or something like that. My ONLY problem with CapCut is that when I installed it, I accidentally uninstalled it, and was not able to redownload after many attempts. I removed the app ""ROBLOX"", and ROBLOX needed, if I'm remembering correctly, around 702 MB. So I was sure I could download this again, but no, it's not working. It works sometimes, though. Please try to fix this, Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is good I wouldn't give it 5 stars in the first months I had the app the first edit I made was great. But after making a couple months maybe 3 or 4 all of them just turned into black screens with a Japanese message on it. I don't speak Japanese so I don't know what it says but I usually just closed the app and it would still be there so I had to delete the app all together. This happened multiple times! But in the past 2 to 3 months I've redownload it and it hasn't done this. So far...
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When are you guys going to fix the problems with this app? At first I thought it was just my phone but going through the reviews has made me realize it's not just my me. I can't edit the way I used to be able to. Whenever I upload a clip more than 10 secs long the whole app starts to glitch. My clips turn completely black and won't let me edit them in any way. I really enjoy this app so please, please Capcut fix this problem so I can use the app again :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,For the almost two years I've been using this app it's been a amazing but I need help. I try to make an edit but then when I cut a video to get a clip j need the beginning of the clip freezes and it's not worth using anymore and even when I try to get a different clip it still doesn't work and try to clear storage but theres just something wrong please fix it. It's so frustrating
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love using CapCut! The only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars is one, the last when using certain effects and two, PRO. I enjoy CapCut a lot but ever since they introduced PRO it has been a lot harder to use. Because of having to pay for better effects is making it less of a free editing app than it used to be. And with the lag, it makes it hard to make sure my edit is on timing when finishing up the final touches. Overall, I enjoy using CapCut as my full-time editing app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Text stopped working properly. I'm not sure what happened, it was fine before just a couple of days ago. Now I can't add basic text boxes anywhere. If I accidentally type a wrong letter and press backspace, then it auto populates with ""Enter text"" repeatedly and is just impossible to handle. I even tried pre-typing my text in the notes app first and then pasting it, but then something just randomly happens and text disappears altogether. I hope this can be fixed soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app! I've been using it for about two and a half years now, but with the new update the text isn't working very well. The text will duplicate itself whenever I type a word then click space. Like if I type ""hello"" it'll do this ""hellohello"" and it's really annoying. It makes it harder for me to make videos. Please fix this problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to edit and it costs anything!! I really recommend this for anyone who wants to make stuff for Youtube or TikTok!! However, this has one big negative issue for me: the notifications. They're so unnecessary and so ""clickbaity"". They have nothing to do with the app itself, and it's frustrating to receive them in the first place"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love capcut their are so many amazing effects and transitions! I loved messing around with it but my first edit went wrong and i was obbsessed. I deleted something and it said deleted or moved check your album, and posted it! I was so sad. Also now when i add effects it glitches my video and sound doesnt match. I was working on the transition then added effects, i was making a intro for my friend.. effects glitched my audio and made it not match the video. üòÇüò≠üò≠"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, annoying sometines because it's harder to improve when all the animations added onto the platform are only for PRO. I just think it could be a little better considering what people with PRO get. But overall, great app. Good for editing and an 8/10 for me. I don't hope this is helpful to you, because frankly I don't care if you find it helpful. Bye."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have two issues when trying to edit videos. First, the audio cuts out. At the start it's fine, but if I go to a later part, the audio no longer plays. Which forces me to go all the way back to the start, play through the whole song until I get to the part I need to edit, and as soon as I make ONE adjustment, the audio clips out again. So I have to go to the start and do it again. Second, the chroma key button is gone? Whether it's been moved? I can't find it. Please fix these if possible!"

Any image like literally almost every feature is disabled, please fix ur app. And thank u for reading this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great! Really straightforward and easy to use- but I give 4 stars only because of the audio feature. For songs on my device the music list is all mixed up so it'll be hard to navigate through them- especially if you have a lot of songs like me :' Please make navigating through songs on my device easier- other than this the whole app itself is great! Thank you and keep up the good work!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I open my capcut, and creating something to edit, something always happens. They were freezing and lagging black screens. And etc. This is so disappointing whatsoever. I can't keep this up so I had to give it a 1 star because with this freezing and etc what I said. I kinda want to download a new app that doesn't lag. But I'm not giving up on this lag. If this keeps going on I'll give up. I might throw my phone out of the balcony,"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I kinda like Capcut for awhile now, like for 1 year or 2, since it's easy to edit with, but after my phone update, and coming back to the app whenever I open it, the app crashes then closes always. MAYBE the app can't handle the update of my phone, or it's just my storage. Pls help me fix this. I need to get my projects back without deleting them or the app itself. The app will always crash whenever I go in now. Just update the app or whatever."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It a great app, been using it a while. The only annoying thing is that, before the last update, you were able to center the text without barely moving it across the screen; now it takes a lot of work and precision to be able to center it, I don't know why you decided to change it but it's annoying and it's a waste of time trying to center every single thing you write. Hope you can change it to the way it was before."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I've been using it to make tweening videos. But there's a bug where when i add more pictures to tween it starts to corrupt. The screen turns black, the video isn't smooth (at least in the app), and when i try to tween i can't re-size or move the image. This really disturbs me when i'm tweening, i hope you can fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, its just that everytime I'd try to put a text on my edits, the fonts won't work, and when i try to adjust some clips, it lags a lot, and lastly, when i try to export some vids, I'd have to wait for so long but ends up getting cancelled. I hope you try to fix this bug, but other than the issue, the app is good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the app is great, however I find it very frustrating when I add in a clip but make it very short but then I'm unable to go back to edit it because it's too small, so I have no space for my fingers to press and I just keep on pressing 'transitions' it'd be great if they remove the transitions buttons in between clips/photos and made another way to add transitions"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the video editing software I've been waiting for? and surprisingly it is made as an app, and not one that is comparible for a computer. I hope a computer version of this will be created! Has almost everything I want and need to create superb videos. The features are packed, and I hope more pre-made effects and so on will continually be added. üëçüèºThank you developer for making this, you all are the best!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a really good app, it's not about the animations in general, in my opinion it's really just on how you use the app. Although I have some suggestions, please read the following things. 1. Motion blur, this app is already really good but I think it would be a better app if you put a Motion blur suggestion. 2. Smoother transitions, there are only slightly a bit of smooth transitions in the app but I think there should be a bit more. Although the things needed to add this is a easy app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an incredible app. Easy to use, works well and minimum lag. But for some reason the app keeps on being unable to open out of nowhere sometimes and it's extremely frustrating, then the only way to get it back is reinstalling the app but it sucks because then everything you have is gone. Respectfully I would really appreciate the developers of capcut to fix the issue. Thank you!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect! Has all the basics you need which are free and I think that's brillant. I use this daily for edits on tiktok. It provides everything I need The only issue I've come across, is when I upload 4k videos app just shutdown and I can't edit it. Since the new update the slow motion seems to be choppy on all of my videos. If that could be fixed it would be 10/10"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app for editing and creating videos!! You don't get overloaded with ads, the only ads I see don't take up my screen or stop me from doing stuff, they just appear somewhere that's out of the way of my main focus if anything! And there are templates to use, many great tools and very easy to use! I would definitely recommend this app to a freind!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a reliable video editor but this app has caused me some problems which need to be fixed. First, whenever I make videos that are 1 mins or more, CapCut freezes when I try to put in texts for subtitles or overlays. This then effects the preview of the video. I did some of this before but it is just getting worse. And secondly, unexpected lags which then caused my to get kicked out of the app. Can you please sort this out?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's no way to open the file I want to edit. App only allows file selection from thousands of small squares with numbers on them. You pick a file based on how long the video is! IQ 82? Just guessing... Yes, I want to edit a file that is one minute twenty eight seconds long. Doesn't everyone choose files this way? Some app developers need to change career. I suggest catfish farming. The catfish don't use names. You can just ID them by their length."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but now it's awful to use. Putting any kind of text is a hassle, before hand it was simple and easy no issues. But once the update happend back in January it's not usable. So what the deal is, is that when you go to put text on your video it not only zooms in so that you can't see where the txt is in relation to the video but if you type a short word the text just up and vanishes and its like you never put text on it at all. This bug needs to be fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok so the effects, transitions, key frame, graphs etc are superb and the fact that they keep on updating is great. It has been 1 year since I am using the app but the only problem I've noticed (and waited for an update) was the 4k resolution problem whenever I import a 4k vid and try to edit and export at 4k the pixels become visible like literally and the video becomes grainy so I have to use other apps to achieve that quality. Else than that i had a great experience."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"to be honest, this app is really great. we used this app multiple times in editing some videos for projects or contest, and it helps us a lot. but the only thing i don't understand is why do it lag so bad, i mean at first used its fine, no lagging but when you used it for many years already, the technical problems began to show. it is really annoying and bothering, i just stops editing videos here because of the nonstop lagging. i don't know if other people experienced this too, so please fix."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app in general is fine, however I've been noticing my older videos have been laggy A LOT. Like I mean can't even access them. A downside is that if you don't have TikTok you can't get other music to your liking, It'll have to be exported from a video. The app is a little hard to use, but ofc you can watch tutorials which is fine. But overall the app is easy to access but gets laggy after a while."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong, this app is awesome and has some pretty cool features... However I can barely even use it. I don't know why it's bugging out so bad but things won't load. The videos I try to edit won't load and I'm unsure as to why. I keep trying to use the split option to split videos and it takes forever to actually execute the action, of it even does it at all. I really hope this is fixed as I love the app features..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I very much love it, the features were all excellent, but only before the update, the new style feature, were once have many option but then only 3d zoom were available for use. And it would be nice if searching box for music were available. Thank you. Updated : Thank you for noticing my feedback! Now searching for music is easier üíï Can I also asked for it to be able to edit offline? By downloading the resources?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi Capcut developers! I really love and use this video editor a lot! However there are some features I want to be added, (1) orientation, sometimes, I just wanna edit while I am in landscape mode, (2) layer management, I don't really feel comfortable with the layer management, I think it will be better if we can just drag the layers either up or down ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Overall, I love the video editor, great features and it's definitely free. ·ï¶( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)·ï§"

Great work guys. ü§ù Adjustable things: could there be video template as its connected to tiktok, can't there be templates for pic just as there are on TikTok. The syncing of tiktok favorite music is cool (with data ooo) but why can't that be same for som filters and video template. Check that out pls and also make some easy adjustment so the transition could have a shuffle option with selected transitions. Asides that... It's a cool app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, I've been using it for a few months but why 3 stars? Well everytime I have a One minute video my capcut app starts glitching. Its so annoying everytime I try to edit a clip it won't let me, I tap on it then I can't edit the clip. And everytime I try to play the one minute or two minute video it takes a few tries to play it, at least 3-4 times. please fix this!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay, I really like this app to edit videos but ever since the app forced me to update I can't find any of the effects I used to use in my videos. For example, the shake effect is gone. I'm not sure why you all removed the basic effects because I certainly didn't ask for it to get taken off or for some effects to be placed in different areas in the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"No watermarks. Has an end screen that says capcut but can be deleted before finalizing the video. THIS EDITOR IS AMAZING. It has background removal without the need for green screen which the only other app I've been able to do that with was Instagram, no other editor so far and it did it very well! Also the editing process is good and haven't had any glitches like the many other editor apps I've tried where you end up missing video or it crashes or the audio is out of sync. This one is good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When making the video it's perfectly fine but when trying to exporting it the video turns out glitchy and barely any of the screenshots show up, This problem has accrued for the past few days that the new update had released. I use Capcut as my main editing source, I find this problem extremely frustrating and difficult. Fixing it would be utterly appreciated."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app is amazing and i really like it so much. i could rate it a bit higher but i have 3 problems with this app ; one, is the blue line, please add a setting where we can turn it off and on because sometime's it's useful and sometimes is not. secondly, the glitch ; i don't know what happens but it just randomly goes back even if i havent pressed anything. lastly, it crashes ; just like the glitch i havent even done anything yet when it stops working and then crashes. please fix it! thank u"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I was using this to edit a video and it was just so glitching at one point. It dragged my one screenshot and made it 30 minutes long! Then it wouldn't let me touch it or it would glitch so badly. Also I can't green screen. I would also like to be able to click on a file or a photo multiple times while inserting it into the clip. This is the 3rd time I have had to download this and I am very disappointed. Sure, it's sometimes good but it's needs de-bugging and good updates :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has to be the best editing app I ever had. There are 2 problems though, whenever I delete the pictures/clips I used for my edit, the app will delete my edit or the part that the picture/clip was in. The second problem is that if I put to much or a lot of effects it will get really slow. But otherwise this app is really good and I really recommend it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Why does one time when you do an effect allow you to choose a speed, but the next time you don't let it go? This greatly interferes with the installation of video, and the transition comes out very fast and ugly, since it allows you to choose a speed of only one second! Please fix it. Without this flaw, the pragram is good, convenient and can quickly understand how to use this program"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I honestly think its a great app for beginners but there are some problems like every time i add affects on to my edit and started playing the video it just completely lag and glitch. i couldnt even hear the audio or how the edit is doing. But i do really really love that were no watermarks and that just prove that this is the best editing app for me thats why i gave it a 4 star. great job on the app and looking forward for more updates.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using CapCut, it's very easy to use after getting used to it. You don't have to pay for anything, and it being connected to TikTok makes it a lot easier than other editing apps. My one problem with the app is that you have to actually open your edit to download it, I recommend to add a feature so you can tap on the 3 dots and download your edit without opening it. Other than that this is a good app for beginners editors and more advanced editors."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is really an amazing free editing app! It's easy to use and has a lot of features to use, It's a highly recommend app for editing. But one thing is the, ""No Connection"" problem I always get.. I uninstalled and installed it a few times yet it's still there. Hoping it will be fixed soon!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's free and super easy to use. I've been using capcut for about a year and I'm impressed by quality, though there is still room for improvement. This app is great for creating videos, audios and practically everything. Though my main issue is that it has a maximum number of layers that you can use and it sometimes a little glitchy but overall is an amazing app and would definetely recommend to new users trying to learn how to make and animate videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app I've been using this for months now, and so far I had no problem with it! What I love about this is there isn't any watermark, there is at the end but you can have a choice to either keep it or delete it, such an amazing experience especially since some apps that contain watermarks are really annoying, although I suggest capcut to add more features that are like alight motion, and I suggest for it to not be that laggy, but it's amazing so far, loved it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really a great app! üí™üí™üí™ However I hope on its next update, I hope we can use the app and edit videos on landscape mode.

Just loading and come back beginning. Please fix it immediately."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good. Apart from when it freezes when I try to add a video. Which is kind of the point of a video editing software. It's fine for photos, but for some reason it instantly freezes every time you try to add a video. It's extremely frustrating when you've made an entire edit only to find that you cannot add in videos. Hence the 2 star rating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of the best video editing apps available. I had some gripes last time I reviewed but apparently the app was in the middle of a transition. That has all been settled with all the updates. The only problem I see is sometimes the app gets bloated. Had an issue and wasnt looking at capcut cause I usually empty the data to clear storage space but when I did everything else and went to capcut I noticed low and behold the biggest bloat I've had yet.. almost 2gigabytes. (This is a rare situation)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have finally found the app I have been looking for since the past 10 year, all thanks to you CapCut I really like the new features. You can edit and make a video even when you are offline, video lyrics, you can adjust the lyrics to the size of your choice, animation, everything guys I recommend you to try this App it's among the bestest Apps I have ever used before."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Capcut is really good. But I am not sure why capcut is slow. For instantance I am tryna make a video the video will be very slow and be very hard to edit. And its more like the video like speeds up at first and slows down. It does like the speed up itself. And it makes my videos just look weird. Please fix this. And when I time parts of the video like text. It removes it from the correct timed area. If that makes sense. But please fix it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing app where you can create your own templates or use an already made template that have themes of happy, sad, mad, excited, long distance, relationships, loss of close ones, and basically any kind of themed template you can think of. It has 100+ themes and fonts and you can use a LOT of filters! The only bad thing is that when you try to make a template, most of the good filters and effects are for pro members. Other than that, Capcut is great for edits! Hope that this helped!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I really like this app but in my last update, in the past few days, it no longer works well and that made me hate and became unhappy of the app. I give this app two stars because it no longer works offline. I can no longer apply text and animation effects to my video when offline. And one more thing, I can‚Äôt properly edit my video because it gets scratched or glitched while I‚Äôm editing. That's why it can‚Äôt keep up with the music or the record I applied. Hopefully this problem is fix."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong, this app is really good, but the thing that really bothers me is that, when i add effects/transitions or just split a video into more videos, it starts lagging very badly. The effects won't show, the screen freezes and i can't work with that at all. At first I thought the problem could be my phone, but that's not it... It'd be amazing if there would be a way to fix this or at least an explanation."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I completely love this app! By far, one of the greatest editing apps that I can trust to get things done! Been using it for months, and it hasn't let me down once. Wished it had more editing options, but other than that, it's great!!! Would defintely recommed this to those who are beginners at editing. It's simple to grasp and understand. <3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app,its my go to when editing videos. I've never seen one better.my only complaints are not having very good songs and when I'm having a song playing while making a video it always is off because it doesn't play the song immediately like it should. Now it has this glitch where you cant play or edit it. I deleted caput to try and fix it but lost all my drafts for nothing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app, few complaints though. When clicking on the sounds button without internet it will try and load the tiktok sounds, which takes a while and is annoying when I'm just trying to upload my own sound. Aswell as that I would like to see a feature that works with USBs because currently even if a USB is connected to my phone, it doesn't detect the files and it won't let me upload my own mp4s. Otherwise good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, but sometimes (most of the time) it's really laggy. Often times clips don't line up with audio and adding effects also causes the app to start lagging. It usually lags on it's own though. Better quality slow motion doesn't load at all and when I move an overlay or text it appears in a completely different spot than where I moved it to."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Such I good app!! Best editing app I've ever used! I'm just experiencing one issue. CapCut takes up a lot of my storage, but I dont think that has anything to do with the company that made capcut or anything. I just need that to be fixed because I have plenty of storage but then when I try to redownload it, it says ""not enough storage."" But AMAZING app!! 9.8/10!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was good around like a past year, But with all the templates it's like.. the app is getting lazier for editors? And the removing of the graph effects editing like Tweening, Zooming in, etc. ""oh there's effects for that!"" Most of the effects glitch the hell out and honestly id just say this app is for lazy editors and little kids who make edits(made out of templates)of their favorite cartoon characters and call it theirs. And the effects are getting Bad... I rlly miss the graphs tho lol"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for editing and videos but sometimes it glitches out way too much to the point i can't edit on it properly. (Not sure if it's just my device)‚ÄîSometimes when I add smooth slow motion on a clip it won't show me keyframes, and other times it'll delay overlays on the preview video. Though despite that it's easy to use and simple to understand."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can only give one star for now because now there are templates that are muted and have capcats creator that he can no longer post because there is no music to shoot Because it is said to be copyright even though it is not copyrighted, I hope that there will be a way for the users of the template to find that it is beautiful and in good order."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely terrible app. First of all, the app is extremely laggy when playing your edit. Second of all, none of the free transitions, effects, or animations are good. Third of all, when trying to export any video with 60 fps or 4k quality, it won't even work. Fourth of all, you can't even watch your video in full screen. When you click the full screen button it will still be horizontal and you can't rotate it to actually be full screen. I do not recommend this app. Get Alight Motion instead."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is the best video editor app I've ever used! It's easy, lots of templates and allows one to be very creative."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing editing app in my opinion, always gets amazing updates aswell. It's very underrated, even though I feel like it is js as amazing as apps like alight motion and vivacut. As an editor, I think this app is really easy to use and doesn't get ads. However, it does lag alot when putting a few effects or some clips. It always makes me end up needing to export. Also, CapCut Pro makes it harder for editors w/o it to find good effects/animations üòÖ That's all I want to say! ü´∂üèª"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"What I loved most about the app was 1. I didn't have to pay money for certain Effects, animations, etc. Since most of us are broke 2. I loved the wide range of options. However, now if I want to use certain options that were free, I can't convert it because of Pro level. I'm pretty sure most people who use this app are teens and kids 10+. The app also glitches either after or in progress after 6/7 minutes. On the bright side I don't have to put up with Ads though & it works well in general."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"üíï My favorite editing app. Amazing. Only a few notes: far too many ""premium only"" features, which recently just popped up, so it's about of a shock Tomy system,. Too much pandering to TikTok, and not the cutting edge trends nor quality in regards to TikTok. Can't stand that the main slot requires a video. What if I don't want a video there? What if I just wanna export audio? And last, dragging and dropping is not precise and not possible when choosing to bring a main video down to overlay area."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't gotten pro mode yet but I'm seriously considering it... it seemed like just other day I was able to do everything for free but maybe I'm confused. Anyway, besides the fact it takes getting used to and doesn't have the easiest UI.. it's great once you can figure it all out. It's not very intuitive and kind of annoying but it does a lot of stuff for a phone app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"OH. MY. GOODNESS. Okay, I use this app at least once a week. I do gacha--weird, I know, but hear me out. Animation? Easy. Templates? Great. It's easy to learn, easy to use, and super helpful in advertisement, animating, or any other things. Even if you don't have capcut pro, this app still has an abundance of effects and adjustments to easy video editing. Love it!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"hands down the best experience for the editors. What not it can offer in such a free application. That's why I'm writing here to tell the developers to improve some shortcomings like, writing animation effects, ""with sounds"", it's a hassle to adjust sound effects separately. Can't adjust the color grading freely after adding key frames, apply to all should have selection option like which clips I want to apply the adjustments. Hope they'll have a look at it. thanks."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love capcut. It was the only editing app without a ""pro"" version, and the smooth slow motion was actually good. But now, ever since the pro version capcut has been so much more laggier. The smooth, slow motion doesn't work. It's laggier than how the clip was before. When I press the background, it lags and crashes. Another annoying thing is that if you have velocity or smooth slow motion on, you can't reverse. And please, please fix the choppy velocity. I am not hating. It bugs me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mean, actually this is a good editing app! But I also have a problem. When I play the video at the start it gets fast a bit and goes back to normal, which makes the audio a little bit late. I've told this to my people and they were experiencing it too, and it's not about the WiFi or anything, and I don't even know if some other people are experiencing it too. Please fix that, and that's all. Great app though!"

From the amount of lag this editing software causes to the amount of effects behind a paywall is just, NO. Whoever has a plan to use premium, please do not risk $7.99 just for new features. Also, why bother even putting ads about pro on a perfectly alright editing software just to become a cash grab that most other applications are turning into?

Aside from the other issues, I CapCut is alright to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly at first this app was my go to editing app, it was great and useful for someone who didn't really enjoy using kinemaster. But as time has gone on it's grown so laggy and just unbearably slow. You can type something in the text and it'll act as if you didn't even type it. Also trying to sinc the video up with the audio while editing is also really painful. I got capcuts pro hoping it would sort or even reduce the issue but it's as if it's made it worse. A waste of money tbh"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut ie the best editing app, no asking for money for extra features, but there is a thing that I want capcut to do, make it so you can add more than 6 layers, I sometimes get by this by putting on one layer at a time but it is very time consuming, anyways that's my personal experience, could Capcut also add glow effects to make the edits more smooth? (Like more natural lighting but with colours) Anyway this app is really good for new editors definitely recommend!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really great for editing videos! No need for a tutorial, really easy to understand, and there are a lot of useful tools here. (Now I understand where those tiktok edits come from) The best part is that it's not one of those editing apps where ads pop up every 30 seconds. 100% would recommend (especially to those who don't have enough time to edit things on computer. They can take out their phones and edit their videos/photos anytime anywhere! I live it soo muchü•∞üòò"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way I started to legit hate this app because of how it has changed to a premium necessity. It is horrifying. Editing isn't easy, and it can take several hours if not days, (I am a professional editor), and not everyone can get premium. So when the app RUINS the video you put so much effort in... I wish I could give less than one star!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Capcut..... Nice concept.... Catchy transitions.....Good user interface. I will easily recommend it to any other person interested in video editing

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is, simply, an EXTRAORDINARY video editor. Even if you don't buy CapCut Pro, there is still so much potential this app has. Whenever there's an update, it's always a great one, literally the opposite of Roblox's updates. Once you learn how to use this app to its full potential, it might start looking like your video was made with After Effects. In the next update, you guys should add a ""Camera"" feature. (just like Alight Motion's camera feature)"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I initially wanted to give CapCut 3 stars because it's quite decent for making edits. However, I have to rate it one star due to a persistent issue of lag. The frequent lagging has made the app frustrating to use. What adds to my frustration is that while many others have access to 2k/4k options, I seem to be left out without any clear reason. It's a significant drawback that needs to be addressed for a better user experience."

I had to wait until my ba3 died completely .thankfully my phone came on after charging it a bit and I since deleted the app to reinstall it again...hoping I don't have same experience again

So people can only see parts of the advertisement. Makes it pretty much worthless now but I'd give it 5 stars still."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App sucks unless you s computer genius or pay. Can not stand companies who mislead potential customers with their advertisement and make it look so simple and easy when they know it is a bunch of steps involved and not every single video or photo fits into their little video itself.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The problem is the templates are not showing and if it shows and I try to search it wouldn't let me search the templates I want btw I'm using a Samsung phone And it's android 13 btw!!! So fix this bug!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a nice app. My only issue was it posted anything I made on my account without me seeing. Around the 20th video I made it finally gave me an option to not post on my account. Other than that it's the best editor app I've used!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the fact that there is also capcut pro because there is a lot of cool stuff but cause of the capcut pro those stuff are not cool hate it!

Please then maybe more people will download capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, but when I'm making an edit that has more than 1 effect or a lot of transitions, it makes the video lag a lot. When I export it, I find that the video isn't quite how it showed. Itll be off beat or the effects wont show up in certain places. Other than that, I would definitely reccomend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Somewhat confusing how make videos and finding templates. Once I figured it out.. I can't stop making videos and exciting, fun photos. I enjoy this app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Zero issues. I mean it's free so it does way too much and offers too much to complain. Would I like to be able to edit languages of captions? Sure. Am I gonna download and pay for a software that allows me to do that? No ill just find a different template on capcut. We are picky and want perfection for free but considering this is free it's pretty close to perfection.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As of now, capcut is one of the top tier mobile video editors, but I only gave it 3 stars for 2 things. First, you can't freely set the starting point for vids and pics which is available for other editing apps, in Capcut's case, you'd still need some outside factor to set a vid's/pic's staring point like putting in a black pic at the start. Second, please add a new array of animations. Right now, capcut has a few amount of animations unlike other editing apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app! But there's one problem... when I get inside the app, and go to the template page, the app crashes.

I am not trying to rush the producers and such, But we truly need this. The graphs, Auto velocity, effects, transitions, stickers, overlay, everything is AMAZING! But the glitches!

I've deleted so much stuff and yet it still doesn't work. It works ok (but still some lag) up until I go to audio, which is where the whole app, even phone, goes down from about 1 frame every 3 seconds to just completely freezing. It has made the app unusable and this has happened about halfway into a project so please fix this performance issue. Thanks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App was kinda cool till this recent update: now any color of lettering isn't readable using the Animation ""Flare"" if it isn't white lettering. It would be nice if there was a tab option to drag to perfect end of each picture or video instead of moving the bar back & forward with the text or music just to get it perfect. However, I did like how the transition of the effect would show a fade in & out into the next picture or video & it also shaved off a few seconds but that's gone now ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good editing app, it's easy to control and easy to find stuff. The only problem is that whenever type an emoji on the text, it doesn't show the emoji. I'm not sure they made an update where you can add emojis without having to use the text or if it's just a bug. But overall, it's a good editing app and the retro filters are amazing! I recommend for every time of video anyone tends to create!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app! I would definitely recommend this for all the beginner editors out there. There are so many transitions and presets to chose from! But I wish there was an option where you can make your own transitions, also I wish that the transitions were smoother. Anyway it's a great app. Would definitely recommend it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love editing video with this app, it was really great at the first because you can download the effects, transition and animations and edit videos without connecting to the internet...that all changed since the latest update, to edit the videos you want you have to stay connected with the internet if you wanna use the effects transition and animations."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use the app to edit until recently. The effects and fonts and transitions won't load at all. I tried reinstalling it back to back. I even switched phones. So I thought it was because of my storage so I deleted almost everything off my phone and it still didn't work. So I asked my friend to download it on his phone to figure out if it was my phone or the app. When he downloaded it, the same thing happened with him. Pls fix this all I wanna do is edit."

The keyframes is easy to use and there's a variety of transitions. I've moved to alight motion after a few months, but if you wanna begin, capcut is the right place for you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's the best editing app in my opinion, except now for some reason when I go to video affects and pressed favorites, all of a sudden it says ""No internet connection, connect to the Internet and try again"" but my wifi has 4 full bars. I read the other reviews, and I'm not the only one who has this issue. Please fix the problem or people are just going to drop like flies from using your app onto another. I'll give a better review if the problem is resolved. Thanks."

Recover it in your album, "" but those vids or pictures are never deleted or moved. I have them. It seems like Capcut is willingly trying to mess up people creations for their own benefit. It's digusting and even worse when people online say they have the same people and they refuse to fix it overall 1 star fix your app Capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good, i have a few complaints though, first its really laggy and glitchy most of the time, sometimes cap cut deletes my projects or it messes with them, the 3rd transitions look ""cheap"" may i say and i think they should not look so low quality, the filters are weird? But other then that this app is really good the fonts are great and my edits always are on beat using this app, this app is really great and i would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for my complaints, great app!!!!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is getting better and better now. Before this update it's quite hard to load and use effects. Now it had the auto effects so you don't needed y to move it on the keychain (chrome plated) But there is still a problem with moving the photo it's always reconnect with the main background it's hard to zoom it or rotate it :( Yet- somehow please fix that problem üëçüèª‚ùÑÔ∏è
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yes, seems to be a full-fledged video editor, but when uploading a 4k video to reverse the playback and edit, the app changes both the color and quality of the video so it looks very low quality and grainy afterwards. There will need to be some changes in the app for me to use this as a daily video editor. - Fyi I am using the free version, So if this is something that the pro version will allow you to upload with no degrading of the video, I may come back to this."

I'm not sure if there's a way to disable snap but if there isn't, it would be nice to have that feature (as an optional one too, so people can enable it and disable it.) Otherwise, it's a great app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's easy to use and there's a lot in it. my only problem is that the playback will start to lag if i use plenty transitions or effects at one video. maybe it doesn't happen to others but it really affects my experience. also, it'd be nice if we can use the app on landscape mode, it might make editing easier."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"capcut is really cool! good to edit videos and make animations with! my only problem is: whenever i add a lot of overlays, it only shows about 3 of them, and the other problem is if i add a lot of photos to a video, it will go all glitchy and delay the video until i export it. other than that, this app is amazing i use it all the time!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why only 3 stars? Well here is my reason. First of all. It lags whenever I play the video I'm working on. Second of all.

I like how it has good templates and stuuf, but then when I try and choose a sound it doesn't show because of copyright, thus then I have to get a video to place in the editing app to get the sound I want. I totally understand., but can people ty and make it a little better?"

Its starts lagging and it can't play so I need to close the app and start again and then... When I started it..its get more laggy its really annoying I can't download the vid I edit Bye"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app it is amazing! A few things I would suggest adding however is firstly maybe an option to mirror your media and a type of graph like Alight Motion has to make the keyframe transitions look smoother. I also suggest adding a motion blur feature so transitions look smoother that way too!! :) I think what would also be cool would be a feature which allows you to add bounce to your media
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app was an easy 5 star all day for video editing but the recent 12/8/22 update completely ruined the text editing. Can no longer update the formatting of all the captions, editing text or captions is now impossible without the popup text box above the keyboard. If these are fixed/reverted it's definitely back up to a 5 for me. P.S. Allowing the user select the the text size before autocaption splits it up would be HUGE!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using CapCut for a few years, but about a month ago this annoying glitch started. I would export a video and it would freeze in one frame for a bit and then continue and freeze again. This glitch started to become a problem, so I uninstalled the application and reinstalled it again. It did nothing. I know this isn't my phone because I installed CapCut on my computer and the same glitch happened. I'm not sure what this is or why it's happening, but please try to fix it. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Basically 5 stars but I would love if they could make it so that could you could save clips you‚Äôve edited into a new section. Basically, select the clip, hold it, then a section comes up asking if you would like to save it as a new clip on the 'saved clips' section. It would make it easier to edit instead of having to use photos to sort out my videos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's great if you want a free, easy to use, watermark free app, and has many accessible features for all devices! The only thing I would reccomend is a toggle button on the snap grid, when editing it can sometimes be annoying, and hard to position things that are slightly off centre. Other than that, great app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first I would have given this 10 out of 10 but as of recently the videos and my edits have gotten messed up, I open an edit from the saved projects and the clips I've chosen are random clips not the same clips as when I cropped them. So that's why I've given 3 stars. But if you just make an edit and export it it is completely fine, it's just when you go back into it and want to make changes the clips mess up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app, it has complete features but my problem is that it just cancels the exports automatically and that doesn't mean i have low storage because my phone 32 gb storage, due to this i have to wait for a long time to export just for it to get cancelled. I hope you fix this problem. Capcut is an amazing app but it can get better than that."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far it has been the best app ever best editing app. Specially it's very easy to use you can make videos very quickly won't take much time with this app it's the best editing app. Has too many best editing features without Pro subscription. Cool editing features good filters and a huge music library with every kind of music what else do you need to make a pro video. Yeah but of course there is one issue that I am facing. I am just unable to trim music so to trim music I have to go on Google.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please fix the photo issue, if you try to add more photos or gif, it would start to lag, eventually it would be unusable and needed to remove all the data just so you can clear out the lag. Please fix this problem, that would be really helpful. I'd change the rating if it was fixed, overall it's a pretty good editing app and everything is free"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When reversing a video, this stupid app changes the coloration. We're talking contrast, saturation, brightness, etc., by an unknown value. So when you try to make a video that plays like a loop, halfway through it becomes obvious due to the color change. The only solution is to screw with the adjustment options and hope you figure out the right values. Absurd and should not be a thing that occurs. Furthermore, I want precisely ZERO notifications from an app like this popping up in my day-to-day."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use the app a lot to make Tiktoks, and it was working well...until you updated it this week. Now I can't even use the same old text effects like I used to and the textboxes make it almost impossible to fix any typos when you're trying to type small. I liked it better when I had a bigger textbox I can easily edit, not a smaller one. And it's very confusing to even pick a custom color to a single string of text and half my pro effects just vanished. Bring it back please and I'll put in 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I personally think this is one of the best free editing app, but l do have a problem. I do not like it how when you try to move the letters and sometimes, it glitches. It's okay, though. And l do appreciate how they give you free sound affects and free screen shaking stuff, but yes, as l said, the letters glitch sometimes, so l highly recommend that you remove that glitch, hopefully see this."

I had close to 900 sounds but now says copyright issues? Makes zero sense. I've tried clearing cache, data (yep lost allll my projects), uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times. Pretty useless if I can't get my songs and match cut the clips. Almost threw my phone so frustrating üò´ üò© üòí I sent a message for help and no one has responded."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A Stellar Experience with CapCut I recently had the pleasure of using CapCut, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts. The intuitive interface makes navigation a breeze, and the plethora of customization options allowed me to tailor the app to my preferences seamlessly. The standout features, such as its advanced editing tools and intuitive interface, truly set CapCut apart from the competition, addressing common annoyances and enhancing overall productivity."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use a variety of video/audio editing/creation apps and CapCut is by far the best of the lot! It's fast, facile and bursting with templates (creating your own is a snap!) & FX. Couldn't ask for a nicer, more intuitive, easier to navigate GUI. Its versatility is staggering- you can click a CC template in TkTk (for instance) open into CC, edit & auto-export right back to TkTk! Every feature I've wanted to use thus far is readily available in the FREE version- my highest recommendation! ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I use it all the time for my videos on YouTube. I only have one request for there next update: could you add a selective background to delete from the delete background button? Because whenever I do try to delete a background, the character that's moving keeps glitching out and dissapearing, andi have to resort to unclean versions. If theres any way you could make it so that we can chose which part of the videos background to delete, that would be super amazing!!! Thanks!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Had to come back and change my review. The app is starting to get junkie. Plus I don't like that it's becoming some type of social media app. Features that use to be free now require you to get pro mode. And they are slowing taking away features that I used often like plain blurring of the image. All types of blur effects but the basic one is gone. Adding text to videos sucks now. Sometimes the sound is out of sync and sometimes the app just closes on me. A once excellent app now ruined
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so I've had capcut for about a year and half by now, and haven't really experienced any major issues until today, for some reason a project that I had been working on for 3 or 4 days suddenly crashed, and now when I open the project up, all it shows is a black screen and no audio, I exported the project to see if that would help but it was still 21 seconds of just a black screen. Please fix your app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I totally love this app!! It really helps me when it comes to my school projects. Perhaps the only problem is that, when I deleted all of my videos in my gallery, those videos that I edited on this app suddenly vanished too even tho I already saved it. It's just there's something you need to improve more but still, I'll rate this app a 4 stars, not bad.üòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is the best editing app I have ever used. It has a lot of features and it's easy to use, it's like using a vid editor in a computer. You can put layers of your video, audio, texts, stickers, and more. It's very convenient, especially in these hard times and as a student, I'm glad it doesn't let you pay or have any other things that hinders the experience. Thank you, this has helped me a ton, not only in my school works but my everyday life too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant app WHEN IT WORKS. I used the app yesterday and made a full length video, went to bed and this morning found I was signed out and was not allowed to sign back in due to age restrictions and needing to be over 13... I'm in my 30's I was subscribed to pro but due to this I've cancelled my subscription. I won't entertain paying for something I can't use and cannot find a fix or support for. I tried everything to fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is amazing! I went to college for animation, using multi-thousand dollar software programs like, After Effects and Nuke and more, then getting to use this one for free is mind blowing. There are so many built-in features, and so many more if you are online. I've been using this for a lot of my videos on YouTube lately. I highly recommend it and it is royalty free from my understanding. My one suggestion, please add search option for stickers, there are so many to choose from!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Bang for No Bucks. It has its fair share of lags & bugs but I just exit out & everything is still there. Usually, it'll just not show but it does save so I just back out then click back on the video & continue. Love the fonts, variety of edits. I don't use Pro but the regular covers everything I need for educational videos. I wish they had more sounds but I can always upload the video to TikTok where there's plenty. Overall, very nice."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love editing here, this is my editing buddy since then but when I updated the app, there are some features I'm not familiar of, I kept on trying to use it but I find it a little bit difficult to edit here than before, this version is good for other people, I guess? But for me I want the old version. My phone keeps lagging when I'm applying some effect or overlays and it consume so much storage."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great editing app, I've been using it for almost a year but, there's a glitch I've noticed a few days ago. When I click reverse, the clip is half reversed, and it shows random clips for a second, it's little laggy too.. So the reverse isn't properly working if you get what I mean, It wasn't like this months ago.. so please fix this glitch, also If there were more shake effects it would be cool. (‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†‚Ä¢‚Å†)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but has clear issues. The first is a pretty major flaw with the app and its that not only do some clips just straight up break in the app, showing glitched out varients similar to a broken LCD but also can break in exports which makes it frustrating to use since there's no clear fix. The second is that a lot of things are locked behind the subscription, which is fine if its all new but some of it is old stuff that doesn't even have the pro mark but still locked behind the subscription."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best editing app. So much useful effects , animations , transitions etc. If you can plz add more and more 3D and etc transitions and animations. And I recommend if you can give us a chance to edit the Audio. This app becomes more good because no watermark and all the options are free üåº. I hope there will be more amazing options in future updates. TYSM for making an app like this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good for editing but the problem is that, when I export a video. I mean like, when I export the video and I was out of the app for too long, it just reseted the exporting and I was forced to export it all over again, I didn't care at first but it's starting to get really annoying. But other than that, it's amazing!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really great app, I use it all the times to edit videos. The only problem is when I wanna reverse a video it changes the lighting of the original clip, it really annoys me. I try to fix it by changing the coloring and covering it up with filters but it just doesn't work, please fix this. Overall it's a good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing üòç app with free of cost you have used many templates
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to use, and will, of course, need skill to properly use. Tons of tutorials by other people but I feel like the actual company/business would upload/make tutorials. But by updates and updates it's cotton a lot worse. The size of storage it takes, it used to be about 300MB but now it's over a gigabyte, which is outrageous for a editing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! Currently the best video editing app I've used! I have a little lag with a long video with a lot of files and such added when I try to watch it on preview mode but it doesn't effect the final product. It has an amazing amount of transitions and other stuff like that. I use this for tiktok and just editing in general I highly recommend this app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have seen so much tutorial-like video of the interface of this app on tiktok but never knew what the name of this app was. Glad I finally found it! I test out a video creation and it's prefect! Have almost everything I needed (except for extraction of audio of a trimmed clip used in the creation & option to free browse your own audio tracks instead of scrolling). But, I was using inshot before and while that app has gotten me used to video editing, I will be moving my home to this app now. üëç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"quite annoying really.. I was making a cover and used an image from my gallery, cropped it how I wanted so it could fit. however, it just says edit text in the middle of it. when I try to edit the text, it just gives me a different ""edit text"" to change and there's still the edit text in the middle. even if I don't ask for text it's still there and appears when I'm trying to choose a cover from the video I made. then the cover doesn't even work regardless, and if it does it'll keep that text."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I give it a five star because it helps with my edits and it works very well and it never has any issues
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There's some problems with the app that prevents it from getting five stars. For one, the app lags horrendously and the playback is behind as soon as you add too many clips, which makes it hard to time stuff correctly. Some features don't work despite having a high end phone such as : smooth slow motion better quality. And generally speaking, it's ui can be so time wasting at times. I really dislike how difficult it is to copy a clip, I wish you could insert some stuff for easier management"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. All of the transitions and other things are free, but when I play my video so I can edit it. My video is always a bit laggy. Which is kinda annoying because I need to know where to put the transitions. Hopefully I hope you read this and fix this issue. Other then that, this app is one of a kind special and need more attention."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app!! Like I'm crazy about it. It's kinda glitchy and doesn't exactly work at the moment. But I'm sure they'll fix the bugs soon. I mean I can still edit with the app, and it comes out fine. I love the Fonts and just everything about it. I wish they had a version for PC or laptop users because I really enjoy the simplicity of it. I just wish I could use it on a bigger screen, rather then only on my phone :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great but limited in some aspects, but the new 3D zoom makes making edit-videos (For example: Search BlueAkrasia Kaeya animation) easier instead of buying Adobe After effects and spending hours upon hours into animating pictures. Although it's still limited, but what would help is allowing us to select (outline) the parts of the picture that zoom. (Main subject, other subjects,etc.) Another that'd help is making pictures ""bend"" in a stretchy manner (The hair in the video mentioned above)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please rework how you place, resize and rotate text and drawings. Make some sliders to change the X and Y axis, and allow specific number inputs for size and degrees of rotation (i.e typing 67 rotates it 67 degrees). This would be a major improvement as the current system is inaccurate, frustrating and glitchy. This would improve the app a lot, thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I absolutely love cap cut. It's my go to editing app. But there has been this problem where if I delete a picture In my gallery I used in an edit, it will delete it from the edit too. It used to not do that so I don't really know what is going on with that. But overall I love cap cut and I definitely recommend! It's easy to use and just very good!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I use this for making half of the stuff I do make. I've been using this for abt a year or more- great and easy app! Very easy to learn and use! Not to mention it gets better every day :D I have 1 problem though. It gets slower the longer the video is. It even slows down. I understand if u can't fix it- But I kind of want it fixed if it's not too much.. It's probably my phone but- Nice app!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is super cool, Im starting to like capcut more because of the new features such as smooth slow-mo, graphs, auto captions, etc. But I will give this a 3 star, because of the blue thingy when you move, rotate, and zoom the elements such as texts, photos, etc. I bet other people also complain about the blue thingy. I hope you guys will remove it in the next update! üòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good for edits and stuff it's a great app but there are too many plus features fix this and its 5 stars
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well, the app itself is good. Just needs a bit of improvements when it comes to using the templates, there should be an caption to change the aspect ratio of the videos. For example the lyric templates are good but I'd like to use a videos and pictures that are in 16:9 or simply landscape, the lyrics themselfs can stay where they are just make then adjust to landscape and it would make the app perfect. Then I could only give it 5 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"its really easy but yet hard to use... people always thinks its just ""easy"" because it makes the transitions for you but no it doesnt... i always incounter a lot of lags... if i try to replay the video... (scroll back to start and then play) it lags and makes me go back to where i was and i was making a 1 hour long vid so it took so long to scroll back to the start because i was looking for typos... aaaaa... please fix it.. and btw i cannot view the stickers i am using. overall great!!‚ô°"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WHAT IN THE WORLD CAPCUT?!!! This app was very, very awesome, but now it's laggy. Even dragging a sound is hard and keeps deleting. Gosh!! If this is the result of apps that helpful and amazing apps coming to because it became popular, then we are doomed. Did the fame really get into your heads and instead of upgrading it. You just make it worse? God"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's awesome for creating things that are new. Having fun watching the videos that everyone does. And I think that you guys will really like it. Because it's awesome. I get five stars it's amazing amazing amazing I Recommend you to get it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was loving this app up until yesterday, when it decided to stop working right in the middle of me editing, out of nowhere. It said it had a bug, and to ""clear the cache"", did that, and that didn't work. I updated the app, that didn't work, either. Unfortunately, I had to delete the app. Hopefully, they'll fix the issues cause I really liked the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was using another video editing app before and found that one randomly, looking for something unrelated. And I am so glad I did! There is more options, clear layout and intuitive controls. Totally free and no adds, no brand logo in corner and the ending with the brand logo can be disabled from the settings. Couldn't ask for more!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was a good editing app until now. I used to edit here occasionally but NOW it's impossible. Everytime I playback my edit, the video constantly FREEZES on a random cut, and then shortly speeds up to catch up with the audio. It frustrates me a lot, because I can't even see how the final video will look like! I can't sync the video with audio because of this stupid lag glitch."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best free editing app. But two reasons why I put 4 stars. The camera's filters. 1. The glowing eyes are WAY to sensitive. I want to keep it one color, and without blinking, it keeps changing. 2. There used to be all these cute filters when I downloaded capcut. But now there's only green screens (which I love btw) and different versions of the glowing eyes (which I love too)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like the editing and that it is so simple to use and you can give it it's own custom subtitles. And just what a perfect app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app used to work well for me, and it kind of does now. However, I've been experiencing the cons about the app nowadays. This includes having to now pay for certain features, constant updates, losing certain fonts that I use for my projects, and experiencing a few glitches. The developers of the app should consider those who don't have access to the new features, as well as keeping most fonts. At this point, I might have to move on to another app because this app is not the same anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't imagine how disappointed I am. There's one problem I can't fix and it affects my editing experience so bad. When I put 2 keyframes and adjust the graph to ""ease out 3"" and afterwards, I will put a keyframe between that two. I wouldn't apply a graph on that keyframe cuz it's a part of the edit, but without putting a graph, it will automatically move to the edge which keeps going as long as I have the keyframe. Idk what's wrong but please fix it, it's very disappointing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app it's good. But I don't like the fact that you have to keep it open and phone awake in order to export the edited videos!! I mean,videos take quite a long time to download, I'd like to be able to do other stuff and know that this process is being done without having to be there watching the phone all the time. I also use u-cut editor and that app does the job without me being waiting and waiting for the video to be ready, It's running in the back, even if the phone screen is locked."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is very bad. At first everything was going good. Until it started lagging. I was just editing my video very professionally, but whe I added a transition it started lagging. But why? I have a very good internet connection. And because of lag. The app wouldn't even work. So, I had to delete it and replace it with another video editor. And btw restarting didn't work too so please fix it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using capcut, it's very simple and easy. However I have a problem revolving around the text, Whenever i type a sentence, the quality of the text is terrible, it looks sorta glitchy and before the text wasn't like that could you help me please? It's hard to not notice it and it messes up my edits. This has happened to my sister's as well please fix this issue"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is overall good the only thing I wish they would add is that you can restore videos I was working on a edit that took me 4+ hours and I accidentally deleted it from my drafts when it said it didn't have enough space to download, if they can't put in a restore feature I wish they could put in a ""are you sure you want to delete this video?"" And then tell us to make sure we aren't deleting something important, but overall good editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is amazing. Easy to use. I just wish it had an EYE contact feature, so I don't worry too much about reading off my script. Also I wish it had basic transitions and basic options first before other ones. It would also be nice if they had a gif collection."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it wasn't a bad editing app when I first downloaded it, I recently deleted it because it saved all my videos which took up 20gb of my storage which was annoying. I reinstalled it just a few minutes ago to use its character text voice thing, they deleted it. no idea why but they keep ""fixing"" things that don't need to be fixed. it's stupid, it was a perfectly good and simple editing app but now it's not."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, it helps a lot when I'm trying to edit videos. although, I have use a lot of pro effects and I can never export! Almost everytime the good effects are pro!! Please get rid of pro. And also, the ""remove background"" button doesn't work it gets rid of the person im using. Please fix that! Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3 out of 5 stars because the capcut premium was added. THEY MADE FADE IN COST MONEY BUT NOT FADE OUT??? (in text) I'm so mad about this. I used fade in and fade out so much, and they made it cost money. Some people can't afford the app, which makes me so mad. Capcut is getting more money hungry than it was before. You might have to find a new editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app ain't bad at all. I enjoy all the features you put in there really helpful when I create my videos. I wanted to request putting flames and colors around the person or anime characters. I would love where we draw around them and it says for the whole video. I've trying to find apps that have this but they don't. But best app so far for me.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a very easy app to learn and has a lot of potential and has lots of options but over the few years of using capcut after a few days of downloading it it gets very glitchy when you add to many splits or pictures, I thought it was my phone but since getting a new one recently, that's not the case. Wonderful app but please fix the mistake."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is the best editing app. Easy to use and clear UI I really love it... But since I updated it got so many bugs. When I save a video into my gallery it's just freeze But I still can hear the sounds tho. It's Only the video that is freezing. But there is nothing buggy about this app just the video freezing when I saved it to my gallery. Can you pls fix this app plsssss üòÑüòÅ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really great app, however, the reason i took off two stars is the issue with snapping. It is so annoying and there is no way to turn it off. Sometimes i will be trying to do something really simole and it will take me 20+ minutes to do it because the image keeps snapping somewhere else. Please make a feature where you can turn snapping off. Otherwise this is great for people of all levels as begginers can understand the basics yet there are some amazing and advanced edits made on it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, sadly after last update serieus buggy! When adding more then 4 sfx, it start jump around on my time line, need force close, then reopen, put it on the right spot. After start again then need do same process again, with other effects! Seems fade in and out is being buggy too, it can be annoying overtime. But overall still on of the best free editing apps around. That's why 4 * and not 5* (phone : Samsung S20+ pro)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but there's just one problem and it's why I rate this a 3, so me and my friends had to do a presentation in groups and I was editing for it, but every time It exports my phone just becomes really weird, the file gets corrupted everytime and I just couldn't open some apps, if it had to do with the time of the video and the amount of effects it could be because it's kind of long and I added too many transitions, please explain why this happens or fix it, thx"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the slowest app. there is sooo much lag. i have plenty of memory on my phone to run this app. reversing a 13 SECOND clip takes 10 minutes???? it is soo SLOW. 13 second clip!! i cannot believe how incredibly slow this app is. and trying to adjust clips is beyond annoying and frustrating. the drag tool is TOO fast and you end up clipping waaay too much. just use the trim tool. this app is awful update: after 10 mins like i said the video finally reversed only for the export to be glitchy!!!!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It completely stopped working for me. I had it before, bad it worked well, then I uninstalled it for a month or two and now it just won't work. No matter what version of the app, when I enter and start a project, it says "" there's nothing here"" when it comes to choosing photos and the app crashes. Please, help me fix the issue, the app's great but it won't work for me anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app and to be honest the only problem I have with the software is that Capcut has a problem with deleting photos from my edit over time. Like give or take about a week, if you were to come back to your edit it'll say that the video/picture has been deleted or moved, even though I never deleted or moved the photo. This is this makes it a a pain in the butt to re-fix the edit, and honestly if this was fixed I'd give it a 10/10."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is great....most especially the templates but I find it hard to use a template from TikTok to Capcut......it keeps on saying update Capcut. I don't get it please
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app and all, but the reason I put this as 2 stars, is because of the lag. On Android everything runs perfectly but the lag is appauling, everytime I make a split and I try to preview it it always lags on the split while the song carries on, which is really inconvenient because I rely on capcut to not be out of time ect. I don't know why it lags but please fix this. Thanks Jaden"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app I've ever seen and you can't even notice the ads. With this application I've been able to edit any footage from my camera roll or photo gallery. Once imported, you can import choice audios and edit to your liking. I still haven't discovered the full extent of what this app can do. 10/10. My only complaint is that I've been dealing with a bug that crashes my app when I try to add videos. It's only been happening for the past day or so but I'm at a loss of what to do."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I vote this a 3 because when you have it for a long time, like 3 or 2 weeks the cap cut isn't working like before, it wont let me watch video, and I can only edit, without a song. It was good at first but it was not good for a very long time... I have to download and undownload it again to make it happen, which is really suck because i dont want to Lost my video i have before... So please fix this problem, thank youüôÇ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"im going to give this a 4/5 rating because it honestly is more robust, reliable, and capable app. there is a massive setback. I make YouTube Videos frequently & I recently discovered the Auto Caption function. which is awesome... but... the auto captions cut off the last letter of each line. editing text is a nightmare. I maybe get a chance to edit text every 5 min every 10min because it stalls out quickly on my device. Love the App. but will use YouCut for Video Text other than Auto Caption."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Making videos on this app has always been fun! It's always been really easy to make good videos on this app! Unfortunately, I have noticed that in my absence it has gotten a bit difficult. The thing I dislike is how sensitive and how difficult it is to shorten and lengthen a screenshot is, I try to move it to one end and it takes a while for it to process it and then it goes flying, not where I want it to go. I hope that can be fixed soon, thank you for taking your time to read this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It'a a very good editing app! I highly suggest it! The onky thing i don't like though is the bugs and the lags it had- for example: sometimes the video freezes, and like doesn't move but it only plays the ending- some layers are added without permission- but i'm sure that in the future you guys will fix that. Overall this is an amazing editing app, and i suggest this before trying anything else."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. So many different things to edit, cut, and learn. Only thing is that I wish there was a way to share these projects. Other than that, everything is perfect. Make a way to share projects and I will rate 5 star. Edit: either I need developer support or this application is terrible. I had a project for a YouTube video, and it just disappeared. In it's place was the project video, but there was no audio and the screen just said "" this video has been moved or deleted. Check your album."""

(OLD REVIEW) - I've never been so eager to give a review for an app. This is hands down the best video editing app out there today, the features are 5th industrial revolution amazing, truly all-in-one the way it imbibes all the video and audio editing components and options for the new videoüëè"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I was really surprised with how easily I was able to operate the app. I have been on the struggle to find a high quality, free, and mobile editing app for things like YouTube videos, and I think this is the perfect one! I would rate with five stars, but i have not had CapCut for long enough to say its flawless, although it probaby is. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a nice editing app, I have had it for a while now, but what I don't like is how glitchy it can be. Seriously, it can be really annoying. But other then that, it is a decent app to have."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ap does what it says it will do, but it adds data to the file. Every time I cut a video down to shorten and edit it, the file of the shorter video is way bigger than the original. I cut a 15 minute video down to a 2 minute clip, and the 2 minute clip was a much larger data file than the original 15 minute clip. It should have been much smaller"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app iam enjoying the features in it very helpful to go viral
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the latest updates there were many bugs in the app. After using the slowmotion and "" better quality "" feature, my clip suddenly become black. After using the auto lyrics feature and then adjusting the clips some text's just disappear and some just bugs out and ruin the entire video. the fade out animation doesn't work. The graphs suck in after creating 4 graphs or more the picture suddenly bounces randomly!PLEASE FIX THIS ASAPPPP."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 2 year. I had no complain. But after the last update when I go to import a video it keeps compressing the video and it's so frustrating to wait 5 min for a 2min clip to import. Before I have added a whole movie in just one click, no compressing, no waiting. Feels like this app isn't going forward but backwards."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty good, but at like the last milliseconds it cuts off the video by freezing and not fully playing, please fix this. I re-installed it and it still happens."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Seems like a good app at first, but it doesn't let you select or search for videos from your own android albums or categories which is frustrating. It makes you search for videos one by one. I like FilmMaker better, because it let's you find the exact video you need quickly whereas CapCut makes it difficult and tedious. I uninstalled this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app for editing, but there's just one problem. If i use some effect on the video, the whole thing lags."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was about to give 5 stars but I only give one because everytime I move an imagine or layer video or auido or a text it will move by themselves which is annoying and you haven't fixed the new glitch please fix the new glitch I hope you understand ü•π

The app won't let me extract sounds or it wont let me import a sound. Second one is, It wont let me export my videos anymore. Third is, i do not like how when you add certain or too many effects it will get laggy then offbeat, eventualy it crashes back to my homescreen. Please fix this problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Your app is really good for editing and I highly recommend this. My only complaint is the cut out feature. Whenever I use remove backgroubd, most of the times it just removes the thing I want. And for the customized cut out, some reasonly it glitches to where whatever I'm using my brush or eraser on go to the opposite side of where I want it to go. The chroma key is fine overall."

It is a great editing app, it has all the options I need, and more; I love putting captions on my social media videos so deaf people can understand it, and, thankfully, cap cut has a text option, and an auto generated caption option (and if it gets something wrong in its captions, you can go back and fix it). This is a great app, you should definitely install it! God bless"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I loved this app until about 3-4ish months ago. the app worked great and I used it regularly for edits I post on social medias but then there was a text update. I no longer can make certain words/letters transparent without it glitching out (that's one of the main features I used) and now I can't make edits how I would like to. I miss the old text features and I can't work the new ones. that's my only complaint as of now but I wish it would go back to the way it was.

Pls add more affects and transitions. Whenever I add videos like 2:00 minutes long it says Compressing and I dont like that. Overall this capcut is a great editing app and I love it . But pls fix these things ."

U can even make new transitions with the present ones! But I really like to see some more transitions made possibly we haven't seen new ones in ages :') but it's a rlly good app and customization setting in the effects is a big upgrade! U can explore alot of new possibilities! I had a idea maybe try it to where u can move the video effects? That'd be amazing! Like rlly amazing

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Awful customer service. I've got an audio sync issue that only happens on videos recorded with my blue yeti mic. It started a few months ago & was fixed by a previous update but now it's back. So updates are turning it on & off & it only affects certain videos. It's a software bug. I sent them multiple video/draft examples and provided dates of when the issue was fixed & when it came back. They ignored all of that & once again told me to clear my cache. Just disrespectful. I'm done with this app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app..I used this for years and nothing bad happened while I'm editing and as long as I using it,,I learned so much about editing and it's really good because you can remove the watermark. There are lots of effects, transitions, music that can be used just download it. For me this app is easy to use it has no limitations i think, because I am freely insert videos as long as I want. I am thankful because I found this app and installed it in my cellphone..such a big help for my editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a pretty ok app. It gets the job done and has a cool unique style. My only problem with it has actually developed only recently. Whenever an animation is applied to a clip, and that clip is then joined to another clip with a transition, it messes up the animation, forcing it to stop abruptly. Making the flow look choppy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best thing to make vids i literly afor it i love this app you can use it allso with pintrest so good
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Easy-to-use and love the features. I wish it allowed you to automatically attach your custom ending to each video. Same thing for overlays it should allow you to set an overlay for each video. Used it for a 360 photo booth at at event and not having this made it take too long to send it to guests.. But it's fun to use and works like a charm
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Get to the point, it's useful and very easy to use unless you want your ""edit"" to become more cool and amazing. I often use this since I needed it to edit my school activities like performance tasks. I really need new creative animations and this is all I can do to help other people and me. I am very impressed with how so many people getting more creative when it comes to editing, but it's neither they are excited or when it's needed. I really hope you do more creative animations to help others"

I hope you guys fix this, my rating will stay 3 stars while this bug still exists. The ads in this editing app isn't that much, and how easy it is to use it. I'll be looking forward to more bug catching. AND ill make sure, to change my rate 5 stars. Great job, looking for more improvement."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Loved this app and its insane reputation, used capcut since it came out, but even the greatest can fall.

Lag, glitches,bugs, and stuff popping up every second begging for me to buy pro, like fk off."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app overall with nice transitions and is easy to use. Recently though, it seems the app isn't up to the version other people are using. I have no way to get templates from online as it tells me I have no internet connection. Maybe it's because my phone is too old? I have a Galaxy A70 and the app version is 7.9 and it recently updated to it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app and I appreciate how you can import it into TikTok because that's where I post my edits! My only problem is when I add too many things into my video it gets extremely laggy and it always stops on the splits and freezes and I have to reopen the app which is annoying..please fix that for me to give you five stars! Good app though, would suggest for editors!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Incredibly intuitive to use and explore. Menus are not cumbersome and you can create while in the flow literally. Very rare for an app to allow a flow state work flow process to flourish like this does. One tidbit I would fix that does rip me out of flow quite often is the drag menus for adjusting levels.. could just be though. If you could enter numbers as an alternative would be helpful though too I addition to the sliders that get a little wonky sometimes. Amazing achievement for humans
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Is a really easy to use and great editing app, but after a couple months the system flipped out, I can't even watch the videos I make because it crashes everytime.

But every time there's an update, the fonts pop up at a more or less different location than before, making it a pain to find the ones regularly used! Really, how is that in any way professional? Or: how about making a favourite section for fonts, animations, camera transitions etc for individual ease of use...."

A full package and I can't help, but be thankful of the creators of this app. I've been searching for good video editing apps, but none of them even lasted a minute after trying it out. Then I came across this! So if you're searching for a perfect video editor, this is a sign! Install it. P.S. I'm loving and will probably used this for years. Although I know updates are a must, I just hope they wouldn't do the same thing mostly video editing apps have now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terribly optimized, I swear this app trembles at the thought of importing a 1080p video, adding text reduces the fps to ashes, its even worse when you try moving them around and type in them. Cant even make an edit from this because of how it displays the beat inaccurately, tried making an edit, placing clips at where the beat should be, exported, then boom. The video doesnt match the goddamn beats. The only *pros* this app has is that it doesnt have a watermark, the rest is downright garbage"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app was great. It IS great. But there's one major problem that wasn't a problem before. Too many things are premium! Premium used to be a few things now it's half of the features.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Blur effects are a good to utilize when it comes to editing infomercials. But for CapCut whenever Im trying to edit my videos and added transitions or effects on Capcut PC. During editing, the transitions and effects have blurry effect as it suppose to. But the moment I export it, suddenly the blurry effect is no longer visible. Disappointed as hell. It deserves to be in the recycle bin."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's editing power is beyond amazing; unmatched. However, it appears that an unknown update affected all quality formats including 1080p to automatically compress. I do not want my 1080p videos compressed, please disable 1080p compression. I may reconsider my rating once this is fixed. 1080p is Full HD where every pixel counts, I'd like to view my videos as they were intended to be seen."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a pretty great app! It has help me improve alot with editing!but the only reason i gave it 4 stars is..well whenever i export an edit or a random video i get this glitch on top of the edit!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this app has been getting more annoying lately. I was making an edit and took a break. I went back to the edit a couple hours later just for it to say the images were deleted when they weren't. I checked my camera album on the app just for it to show 6 images when there's supposed to be WAY more than that. It did this on my Chromebook too. Please fix this because it's SO annoying

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,nice to edit with however sometimes it can be quite slow and glichy at times. I don't necessarily like the idea of the templates. I feel like they're taking away the value of an edit that someone spent actual time on and replacing it with zero effort edits that turn out great. and all of the AI stuff NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. I feel the same about AI that I do the templates. it's taking away all of the effort that some person put into it.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its a good editing app, But when I make video's, It glitches and when I try to create a video, it lags and has glitches all around the video. I never had this problem, I love the app. Pls fix. I'm changing my rating to two stars. Because now; Whenever I try to use the Text box tool it deletes it Everytime. Please fix this. But the other problem I had was fixed Update: All issues fixed! I have no issues within this app anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I currently use this as my primary editing app for videos. Problem is it doesn't support certain format types properly such as MKV. It makes the video muted and sluggish... Well, saying that is lying... Actually you can't edit them at all anymore.. Makes the whole app slow and you can't press play. I have to edit the video in another app in order to use it in CapCut. Strange."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is probably by far my favorite editing app, I would've given it a 5 star if it weren't for the immense amount of bugs... A lot of times I'll be trimming an image, and the tracking will be really off. I don't know how to explain it, but basically I'll click the edit button on one image, and it'll select the one next to it. It would be really nice if this were fixed. :) Other than that, it's a really good editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love how there are no stubborn watermarks in whatever part of the video. also the free packs you get, it's really convenient! though it lags when you add many effects but still manageable. keep up the great work! THANK YOU! i have a suggestion, i hope u could add some nudge buttons especially when placing a text somwhere on the video. it would be really great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Can't change video position when pre-clipping. Means you have to watch full vid to find end of clip. I wish I could create custom subtitle templates for easier transition to the next text set. (I want to add an overlay of a box and then have the text be static so it always fits in the overlay. Even better if I can add overlay as a pre-set subtitle.) I would like to be able to set font size for subtitles.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Best App I have... But I wish that y'all could fix the lagginess of this app while we're editing... Cuz everytime I edit, it becomes ugly due to the lagginess of this... I really love this app so much, I could not ever find a replacement for this. And also I don't know if I'm the only one but... Sometimes I can't click some Effects and will freeze the whole thing on my screen and smtms when I make the speed of the music into slowed version for my channel, the voice becomes glitchy:(("

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I would give it 5 stars, it's an amazing app that I would recommend for any type of level editing. There's a pro version I don't use it, but it seems to be very nice, otherwise, it's free. Would recommend it if you're just starting off making edits, videos, or just mini things to keep. I especially love CapCut's templates, it is a very fast, cute, and entertaining way to express yourself, without doing a lot of the stuff. Amazing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I could have given it a better review It's a good app for editing and all the filters and overlays are good. I have been using this since 1 year now but recently I'm having some export issues Please fix this problem I can't adjust to other editing apps I can't export videos. When it starts exporting it stops at 22% and than leads me straight to my home screen please fix it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"hi, this app is so amazing and really help me out esp when i'm an editor. however, i have this problem and idk if this problem is common or not. My first problem is the glitch border, whenever i was exporting the video it always have this weird border around my video and it's disturbing to see. My second problem is the motion blur, whenever i want to use motion blur it didn't end like one, instead it become transition. hope you can fix this or if there is some tips to improve capcut it be great"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is pretty good. Only problem is how awful and bad it is to need to resize text or even get it in the right position. It seems to freeze and jitter a bit whenever I try to place text with precision. Having to pinch the screen with my fingers to resize the text is also annoying. A slider or an option to input a size number would be helpful. Everything else about the app is pretty great however.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I first downloaded this app back in 2020, it was great! I don't experience bug's or lag's...but as every update come, the app has been going terrible! I couldn't even edit a 5 minute video like I used to. It always lag's and sometimes crash, sure each update get something added but if it means having a hard time editing then I'd rather go back to the old capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This recent ""update""is a total FLOP! The app is consistently freezing or just not opening at all. Extremely frustrating."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would say that this is a really good app for editing but i encountered a little problems. First one is the video's audio randomly getting muted, Second is when i add too much effects or cuts to the video it reduces the performance,i don't know if its just my phone or maybe it is. And also I've been trying to find my favourite effects for days now because of the new update, the new update Basically you guys changed the effects place and logos it really confused me Alot."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Immediately noticed a super weird glitchy thing while zooming in and out of the timeline; the thumbnails change, putting the timeline out of wack, so to speak. Even though it goes back to normal after you stop zooming, this messes with my interpreting the timeline. Because of so many video editing apps to choose from, this makes this app just unusable for me. Hopefully they can fix it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love using this app but now, it's kinda annoying. Everytime I try to shorten a clip it makes it's like 45 minutes long!! Then it lags non-stop now. Please fix this, I will have to delete it soon if this issue is not fixed. It has also been saying there is connection problems when the connection is completely fine. Please fix this. I will give 5 star review if this is fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One week since I downloaded this app and now I am motivated at last to build my YouTube channel. It has always been the dreaded editing that held me back. Not anymore. Thank you, Caput."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app to use if you want a simpler method to editing videos, however if you aren't using templates then you're in for a rough time. The app becomes unbearably laggy if you're making a complex video edit and some of the features don't even work no matter how long your clip is. Reverse, better quality toggle, and make smoother toggle features are completely useless at the moment."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app that allows you to make beautiful flawless edits. You know those baddie or trendy edits they have? You can make those for free with all the main transitions and animations they have! This app isn't isn't scam like every other app and doesn't have slaw transitions. The transitions are crisp. I was a beginner but caught on very quickly. Many stickers too that are awsome. Please keep adding stickers to the power section nd more transitions. I love them.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad I guess cuz Capcut is continuously crashing in mobile phone or in my desktop I don't know that anyone's Capcut is crashing in desktop but mine is happening but VPN is still on not like that the VPN is off. That's why I gave 1 star. Previously Capcut was very active and smooth Editing app but now it's being destroyed. I will request that pls solve the crashing problem.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is satisfying Video editor for me even though im still learning how to Make it. but i can't give a 5 start because of when in using this app you need to download all of the effect and you also need to update the apps to have more magical effects,filters and transition. but overall it was a wonderful app to use, it is very useful."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a 5 star but the current update make the app annoying the compressing thing takes a lot of time..more than a hour if it's 10 or 20 min video even if you crop it , it takes 10 to 15 min compressing 2 3 min video. I hope developers fix this issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"9/10 I Love this, I use it a lot. The only thing I wish were different is if you delete a photo from gallery you used in it, it takes away the photo in caput, and very rarely it glitches then fixes it's self. It may be because of internet problems, and putting songs in uses internet wich is ok, but if you dont have a good connection its not fun. Over all I love it, I use it for tiktoks and I plan using it for youtube. I have never seen a single add and it doesn't take up to much space for me. üòÑ"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love capcut and use it daily. I make edits of singers and I'm pretty good st it I guess. But why do I give it a 4?? it needs to add like an audio option. Like u can pick any song of yt. I hope this is seen by capcut
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"To be honest, would give it a 5 but it lags a lot, everytime I make a video I add a lot of clips and make them really small but then the video just stops and starts to lag :( . I love this app it started adding a lot of new things which I am veryyyyyyy happy about :) I just really wish it didn't lag cause I add a lot of clips together, this app has been reading reviews and made lots of improvement! so it would mean a lot to every one who suffers from lagging on capcut üôè üôè, thank you!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent editing software; It gets the job done nicely, however when expoting larger files it seems to stop at a curtain percentage. Eg: exporting a big 15 minute video and it stops at 75%. I know it is not just me because I have done research and have seen that others have come across this problem, and even some had to abandon their project all together. Please can you fix this issue because it would save me (and others) hours of time and lots of effort remaking an entire project."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recently heard a news that it upload every single edit to the public without of course consent. What a shame . Disgraceful. I would like it to be shut down. Though I am not sure if the news is fake or not.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but having to pay to use basic features seems like a scam I shouldn't have to pay just to remove the music from a clip just to use it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Could there possibly be a way of zooming across the timeline faster other than scrolling several times? It would be especially useful for long videos
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would have given this app a 5-star, but it gets really laggy sometimes, or maybe it gets fully frozen and when I try to reset it still freezes and after a long time it works- Don't get me wrong, this is a great editing appü§© but... You have to purchase to get the cool stuff, so it would be better if free. I LOVE THE APP EITHER WAY."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app and its very easy to use. My only problem is that every time I try to edit a video for YouTube the app ends up freezing and kicks me out . This happens every time. IVE TRIED EVERYTHING, but noting works. I've tried restarting my phone, deleting and installing the app, and even deleting the video and starting over. It looks like you can't edit videos over 5 minutes. CAPCUT PLEASE FIX YOUR APP, LET ME EDIT WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS PLEAASSEEE üò°."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut used to be great until it became owned by ByteDance recently. For example, it glitches whenever you backspace something that you type. Another example, when you change the color of the text, now it adds a canvas for no reason. It is also harder to scale or transform videos because it automatically clips it to a certain size or location. Lastly, when i save the videos to my gallery, they don't seem to function like regular videos. I can't FF or Rewind them in my gallery. Very disappointed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great video editing App collage lets you play videos at the same time Highly would recommend
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"We all love Capcut, BUT could you PLEASE do something about the fonts. It's nice that you constantly add new fonts, but it's very frustrating and time consuming trying to find my favorite fonts, because they are constantly moving. Either add the function to save favorite fonts or display the fonts alphabetically . It shouldn't be that difficult. When you make a lot of videos the extra unnecessary minute or two searching for your fave fonts add up. Thanks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Been using it for years, very nice, sadly it added pro features and that's just a bit annoying, also every time I open the app it sends me to templates now rather then straight to the editing screen which is kinda annoying but I get over it, overall very nice and I can't get used to any other editing app because of it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for over 3 years, I guess? I love editing videos and using templates as preferences, but there's this one bug. After I cleared up capcut's data from my settings, and then I opened the app itself, then tapped the 'search bar', it said ""Couldn't Load, Please try again"" and I did tried again, but it didn't worked over and over, now I tried installing it on my Tablet, and tried to search? it's still says the same thing. Maybe you could fix it?"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I honestly loved capcut and used it all the time for editing videos but after they updated the video effects its horrible! I cant find anything and no tutorials on yt can help because they show the old effects not new ones. If your going into it blind you'll do well but for me and many others that have used the app for a while this is very annoying and I wish we were able to undo an update.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is generally easy to use and an amazing video editor overall! Though with the recent update,it did remove alot of the older stuff. I can understand and all,but it definitely limits alot of creativity. There where so many stickers and effects that allows you to really bring life to your videos whatever style your going for! Though now that a ton was removed it makes it a bit harder to edit. Not to mention the new prime thing that removes even more creativity,now you need to pay money!"

Everytime I go to use effects, animations, etcetera, it doesn't show the options and says ""No Internet Connection"" instead. I have high-speed internet so I don't think thats the problem, and ive tried all the troubleshooting and still hasn't helped it. As if of February of 2023 it still isn't working and it's a pain to have to deal with this when all I want is to edit my videos with no issue whatsoever."

Also whenever I do text to speech stories, the app completely freezes and takes time to fix. I think there is something wrong with the bugs, I could've given you 5 stars but you really need to do bug fixes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For me this app is amazing. At first I didn't know anything about it but once you explore the whole app theres so much you can do. You can make your own transitions or have transition presets which is pretty nice, I love the filters they make mu edits a lot more trendy. Theres a way to make velocity edits and make your own audio on there which is nice I also want to point out theres no capcut water mark which is incredible for editing YouTube videos. This is an awesome app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It was doing good at first I've been using it for months. The one problem is that when I try to make only a few second edit it lags I thought that if I export it it will time with the audio but no it was why faster than the audio. And even sometimes its so laggy that I can't even use it. I don't know if it is my storage or something because I used to have too many photos but when I deleted like 50+ Or 100+ photos it's still so so laggy

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is cool and there is a ton of nice effects for editing. Although there is many problems, first of all the main thing I can say is that most features that can make your edits look 10 times better is getting pro features. I get that it's PRO features but why not make em free instead of buying it. I find this really useless because my edits look casual and not that eye catching when I make edits."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I edited a video and when I exported I couldn't do anything with it, I record YouTube videos so I like to get things out fast and it takes 1-3 hours just to export one video in decent quality, furthermore you would think it would have an option to go all the way to the end and all the way to the beginning, but no you have to scroll frame by frame all the way to the front, I dealt with this and it was good for awhile till it screwed up a video that took me an hour to make."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, it has all kinds of options to edit, you can even add 2 videos on top of each other and play them. it's like a green screen. And you don't even need to buy it with your own money. It's all for free. The option that you can always save it to drafts when ever your phone is not charged closes, are you accidentally close the app by mistake, it will always be saved to drafts so you can complete editing it I really recommend this app. It is a very nice app. thank you."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was good, but recently has been unbelievably glitchy. When I make a video, the app will occasionally kick me out of editing when I add in a picture. Cleared Clashe, a bunch of projects, updated, etc. The glitch still persists and it's gone from annoying to downright enraging. This app would he perfect if it wasn't for that damn glitch, and I've had to start chopping videos up into parts thanks to it. Fix this. Please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's it's lovely app with very helpful and cool looking features. it's a great app for a new comer. my only complaint is that it gets super slow and laggy the more stuff you add, so sometimes you just gotta guess. they've also added a lot of stuff for premium but nothing for normal users which is really frustrating. ALSO, IF YOU POST YOUR EDITS ON TIKTOK, THERE WILL BE AN AWFUL WATERMARK ON YOUR VIDEO üòü"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly a good editing app, but I'm giving it 3 stars cause for me it keeps lagging and when I try to put in my video a text it keeps glitching, however this app is good for beginner editors <3"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app but the newer versions aren't working. It keeps giving me the ""no internet connection"" error which doesn't make sense since i have a good internet connection plus using a vpn also doesn't fix the issue. I've written emails and actually did whatever they told me to do but none of it worked. I can't even send feedbacks in the app due to this issue. I'm currently using the 5.6.0 version of it which is very old i need this to be fixed immediately but they keep ignoring."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app. Every edit I make always improves and I always descover new things. I have a few issues.First: I do an edit with text in it and after I export it some of the text shrink from the size I did please fix it. Second: I do an edit with photos in it and when Im done and put it as draft I go the next day and press on the video and it tells me (for some of the photos) that I deleted the photo or that it got removed from my phone. Which is not true at all. Pls fix it!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm on mobile and have all my videos, pictures, gifs, etc. in organized albums/folders in Google photos. However, in capcut my photos and videos aren't in that organized manner and it's harder to find the content I'm looking for throughout my gallery. If there is a way you could make albums/folders available here too, it make finding and editing much more easier for me and other people too, I'm sure. Please and thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After newest updates, The thumbnail of all effects & transitions didn't show up. It's just blank and black. Some of it's tool just doing nothing, then the reload logo show up. My Wi-Fi doing fine by the way. And another apps in my phone doing good too.. So, I think the CapCut apps the only one who crashes. Please fix it. Love the apps tho.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its really amazing app for vlogger as well film editing but it will be great if music can selected in folders instead of searching. Sometimes when you search it shows wrong searches. Folder browsing is needed in this app Audio settings such as (PAN) stereo, left and right channels should be also included in this app. Stereo system should be added."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Yet I really really love this app, but something is wrong about it. I use templates but then when I press to preview, It says ""Couldn't download"" it is happening to me a lot. fix this please."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"other than being one of the best app to edit on, one thing i want to point out is the slow motion. It works fine if i want to slow it normally, but when i tried to use 'Better Quality' it just stays on 0%. My clips are usually less than 10 seconds and the quality i download those clips are not that high. I'm starting to get annoyed by this. Please fix it soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very much accessible and easy to use. If you're new at editing, capcut would help you learn from the very basic till the coolest edits. capcut has everything. And mind you, you don't have to pay anything from transitions to frames to everything! Just download what you want and keep updating your app. I hope this app will always be as it is now, no payments to do at all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's kind of horrible. It has plenty of options and cool features but the app doesn't really work. The app often crashes, random clips will glitch out and not work, the clips will freeze while the music plays and there's no way to stop it. The pause/play button only works sometimes along with the app generally being pretty slow."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use capcut to edit my videos but there's a few things I hate about this app. There are many effects that look bad no matter how hard you try to make it look good. The auto velocity looks like you cut parts of the video and adjusted the speed. The background remover takes out most of the character sometimes not even the background. The chrome key is annoying. if you choose to remove a green part of the video/picture it'll remove a white or black part which makes me mad. I hope you can fix these
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this for a month now and this was awesome!!, It has Different transitions, Effects etc. And there was no ads that always popping out, i really recommend this for the newbies, the only problem to me is that sometimes when I start editing it starts Crashing but still worth it though!,this was the best aditor app that I've used... Tnx for making this appüòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app experience is next level first of all its free and it's really easy to edit. When I first came to capcut I had no idea how to edit I watched some of the tutorials that they had and I became a pretty decent editor. I was even able to make a intro and make a bunch of really cool edits capcut for me is my number 1 edting app. Though it does have one problem after you've had capcut for awhile it starts to glitch. Glitch in meaning that i have to click on the app 11 times for it to work
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't have any issue with this app.. it gives me all I want.. For me, it's better, easier and cheaper to use than window softwares.. the outcome remains professional.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's entertaining because you can make a video and edit it with capcut then post it in tiktok.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I‚Äôm very pleased but have some suggestions!So, I‚Äôm a very beginner editor and was happy to come across capcut seeing as that it was free and had great reviews. I have almost mastered this app completely and don‚Äôt want to leave and switch over to something that‚Äôs paid when capcut is doing things that every other editing service is doing. However, there is always room to grow, especially for the editors who‚Äôs skills are growing faster and wanting more. A few of my recommendations is having more ad"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using CapCut for a year now and I must say that my editing skills have improved and keep improving thanks to it. The reason I give it 3 stars is because 1) it gets very laggy when you use a lot of overlays and FX, 2) they add new video FX but remove the others and there's a lot of good video FX that has been removed. Other than that, CapCut is a good editing app and is beginner friendly. You can do a lot of stuff since it offers variety of animations and FX."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm an editor and I have noticed that everytime I add 20+ pictures it lags a lot and sometimes it even makes a clip to 33 minutes. I can't even fully split, edit, or even making the pictures on beat because of the bugs. I really hope you guys fix it, but overall it's a great app. Just needs more fixing :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not good, when I exporting it the audio gone and when I look at it in my gallery it just a gift video üôÉ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Plz bring the old shake effect back üò≠üò≠, also its really confusing to find any effects so if u also could add a search bar. I love this app in my opinion this is best for quality edits, I also like the new update however I have an request of if you could add something where you can add combo and intro/outro together(at one spot) so you don't have to export it multiple times.(I hope you know what I mean)üòÖ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My experience is okay. Basically I would give 4 or 5 stars because I make nice edits but there's a bug a lot of people are talking about and they're saying it's freezing and glitching. I'd have to agree that even when I add 5 pictures it said that's too many and I pressed okay and it kept glitching, slowing down, etc. Please get this bug fixed and I'll try to update it. I will keep you posted. Have a nice day."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it's so annoying how it doesn't make me export my video since I'm using Pro features‚Äîwhen I was certainly NOT USING ANY! I've check countless times, clip by clip and found none at all. Came to a point where I changed some of the animations to see if it works but it never did. I was not using any Pro features at all but whenever I export my video, it shows a Pro feature but without an image which makes it harder for me to find what was wrong. I'm sincerely asking on some update for this bug."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using capcut for a while now and I've absolutely loved the experience but recently I've been having problems with the smooth slow motion. Anytime I tap on better quality, it doesn't load, all it does is just stay at 0%. Pls fix this problem because I really like the app and would recommend to anyone who wants to start editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had a lot of issues with this app. The app is great & has a lot of good options, but the way the app is designed it sucks. (1) Whenever trying to put text, it doesn't move smoothly & doesn't let you put it in certain places like there is a wall? (2) It constantly glitches & the graphics look horrible. (3) Audio is a pain to put in, I'm having to go & use Kinemaster just to convert the audio into a video so I can put it in. (4) When changing the duration of a pic it skips around weirdly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've started using this early this year and this is the best video editing app so far. The effects, multiple overlays and audio options perfectly fit my needs. The only thing is that misaligning/synch issues I get after the update last Oct/21, though I can still manage it with a lot of patience. But overall, it's the best one for me."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great and easy to use! However, there's only a couple issues. For starters, the slow motion isn't smooth. It'd be great if you made the slow motion much smoother to make my edits stand out a lot! Another issue is that CapCut compresses my videos before I can use it, making the quality super bad. Please fix those things!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I export this draft, it always says ""couldn't load, tap to try again"" how many times it still not exporting. I tried lowering the quality to the very least, but it doesn't change. It always can't load. I still have enough storage which is 48.7/64 GB. I tried clearing cache, restart the phone itself, yet nothing works. My connection is also fast, i can load many apps without it stuttering/crash."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Such a good app for video editing and lots of more experience with it. And the big thing is that this app is free not paid anymore or for anything. Great experience with it. üíØ‚úÖüòá

I'm exporting a video rn. I added music, I could even layer some music make voice overs. I used it to put two videos together and add songs. You can upload music from your device (I downloaded them from youtube to MP3) The app will even export in the background as you use your phone for other things so useful! I'll give a update on my video quality."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I must say it's a good app. But I have a like two problems with it, one is that Everytime I put a video it's just laggy. Like really laggy when the video is not. And I really hate the second problem the most. So when Im done with the edit in doing I exported it. Then as I see the video. It's laggy like REALLY laggy. Like it glitches and I tried to unstall it and restall it back but it's the same. Please if this is a bug please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been a CapCut user for a long time and honestly, the Premium update is disappointing. This is the only application only students can have for FREE when it comes to high-quality video editing projects yet you eventually became a Freemium application! I hope that whoever runs this application should revert it back to Free, or else it will be the company's loss since we would eventually crack and modify this application if this goes on."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have already readed all the others reviews from this app, ik this is a fun app where you could choose a template for your picture, and you can even make new project for you, this app is really good but the problem is, there are inappropriate templates in the capcut and still isn't deleted, there's lots of kids in cc but still they do edit that kind of things, and another thing, there's a lot of ads, I really miss the old basic cc, but I think it's alr now, but overall it's good, thankyou!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It needs to have access to different fonts. Too many fancy fonts, not enough usable ones. There needs to be a way to turn off Snap to grid.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great app for finding templates, and small edits. But it does have a few problems that I have encountered. Not installing/downloading things, and randomly logging me out. When I am logged out I am also unable to sign back in and am greeted with ith the message ""capcut is only available for people over 13"" even tho I am. I am also told to try again in 24 hours and nothing happens"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay. This is a great app to learn and get started. But for me, everytime there is an update all of my edits just get scrapped. What I mean is they say the orginal material is deleted off my device when it's still in my gallery, I hardly even touch my gallery nor the videos I use for edits. I lost 90% of my edits to this and it drives me nuts. To see the work just gone like that kills me. PLEASE FIX IT. For now I'm gonna try to find another app or see if there is something I can do to fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's so absolutely wonderful. This app is my number one editing software I've ever used, and I've used six, not including CapCut. I also like how it already has templates from trends, that you can use. The only qualms I have about this app are that it send so many notifications and that the update kind of makes it another social media app. But I just turned off notifications and I don't use the social media aspect of it. Lovely app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app to edit for months and it was amazing before this update. I can no longer add text. It keeps disappearing when I try to add. Also if I get it to stay, I can't edit it correctly because you have to do it on screen now and it doesn't work correctly. Please fix that or allow us to download a previous version!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Its the best app for me all those Aesthetics omg I would not be bored of this editing app. But the videos I work so hard for was deleted out of nowhere I check my gallery and all was there I need to do it again though. Also it slow down whenever I play it to check if all is well aligned and all. I hope they fixed it and notice the other feedbacks because its really disappointing.

For example I added a text 3 seconds into the video but if you export it and rewatch it it appears at 5 seconds into the video. Any way to fix this? It's kinda annoying."

I just don't know how to thank the developer, really. This app is just so perfect and I just would rate it indefinitely just for the fact that it provides so much features and doesn't even charge a penny. Its mostly better than most computer/ laptop editing apps. No one paid me to rate like this btw üòÜ Overall, Easy to use when used couple of times.üëå"

I feel like it good be alot better if you guys had an option for us to make ae like transitions or new animation to make smother edits. Overall, I do have a problem with it ""comprassing"" when I tried to load a scenepack it takes an hour or less. It also glitches a lot when I do text or the audio itself but it is a good app and i like it :) just wish those few problems would be resloved"

I have been signed out way too many times by Capcut, and when I want to add a photo of something, the bar comes up with a totally unrelated picture. It was a good app at first,but it just kept on getting worse. Now I've been signing in with my TikTok Account but now it says that Capcut only allows people 13 and older, which mind you I'm older. now I'm locked out."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well I've been a user of Capcut for a really long time ( For about a year) and honestly? This is one of the best apps for beginners. There are many transitions, but when you use app for as long as me there aren't many thing you haven't use. Making your own transitions would be good, I guess. But over all, it's really good app."

Not happy anymore"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editor overall, but the problems are the 2.0+ GB total of storage, music doesn't match the position they were added, it gets laggy while editing longer videos, and it doesn't support m4a audio format. Edit 24-03-23: it takes more space now, it's very unfair for user that has a 30+ GB phones that doesn't worth anything to use this app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The best editing app ever buh still we need more features
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great editing app. but has some flaws 1. When your a content creator but u need pro for some animation 2.The files are large and take too long to download
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I've given it 3 stars is because it's super buggy. It lags a lot and the playback is delayed if there are lots of media files in the clip. Another bug I've experienced is inability to select 3D Zoom instantly without selecting 3D Zoom Pro first and cancelling it. And for the most annoying bug, my entire phone freezes while exporting the video so every time I want to export a video, I have to forcibly reboot my phone and then export it. Fix these and you get 5 stars from me!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is not working well now. I exported other videos and I put text on it, it keep popping up on the main video. Sorry but it doesn't work well now.. but good. Edit: the issue is fixed now, but why the thumbnail not working? Still good though, other wise, this is my editing for my genshin videos, really good now, I just don't why why the thumbnail not working. Another edit: CapCut is working well now, but if you add video effects/Body Effects the video started lagging, but overall,it's good ."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is very laggy, mainly when using overlays, it constantly pauses, freezes, and stutters when playing, even when there's less than 5, it makes it difficult to use when making edits. It also deletes videos that I didn't want to delete. I was working on an edit, a prototype that took me a lot of time, when I went to delete another video I no longer needed, the app scrolled up, after I had already selected the unwanted one, and deleted my edit instead, this made me mad, it needs fixing asap."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just like a real editing software, it crashes all the time! Yay!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"No volume fade in option. Why can I fade in my music? But not the volume of the clip? Several other video editors have this option. Other than that this is a splendid app, not laggy at all. Just works. If you're having trouble with lagging projects, export the project you're working on, then load that video into the editor. Its hard for phones to process all the edits one would make."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Something that I've been wanting in the app for a long time.. is a section for favorite images/videos when your editing. If you need to access a image or video quick, it would be very handy, to just favorite it, and it'll have its own section. I find that very cool :) There is something like this in another platform, and I would love it if Capcut had the same thing :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Right, this is a good app an all. BUT once you get to a certain amount of screenshots or pictures it lags so much. It's irritating! I'd be trying to edit something and it would mute the sound randomly or do the complete opposite of what I tried to do, like I tried to make the picture go for longer and it just went shorter."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually really like capcut. It's super helpful for video editing and can add all of the effects that my other apps can't, and for free. My only issue is that sometimes selecting something too fast results in a crash. It's not too often, but it can be a hastle when begining to learn how the app works."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for editing! Easy to use and has lots of tools! However, there's a little snapping thing, where it snaps your picture or video into the middle. This is usually useful, but sometimes I want to freely move things around. If there was an option to turn it off and on it would be great!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"wheb you first install the app you might think its good, but once you actually start editing it annoys you to the limit. i do a lot of edits which need to be very well synced to the audio, but when i export them, it suddenly is out of sync, and then i have to sit 1 hour+ to find a way to sync the audio and it still isnt perfect. The only reason this is getting a 2 instead of 1 is because there are some additional features here and there that you wouldnt have on your average free editor."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it keeps on laging and glitching me out everytime I try to export my edits please fix it as soon as possible
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My biggest issue is that after spending a lot of time shooting using the camera on the app.. it's not reliable enough to keep my footage... I literally just lost everything I worked on all morning. Total waist of time. It's only good for editing not filming... Which is a disappointment cuz the main feature of clip adjustment is pointless if it doesn't save your work while working on it.. and you can't go back if you need to..
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It doesnt save the capcut edit from tiktok and its very laggy
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi, CapCut. I really like this app so much. I'm used to it now, especially when making typography there but there's just something that is missing. I hope that you can make free 3D options, and 3D camera movement. I would appreciate it so much if you do! ( Actually you don't have to do it if you want the app to be basic. People get creative there anyways )"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am using this app about 4four years ,This app give me so much excitement when I see different coulers edit here."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps saying the app is not secure, when I just downloaded it. Fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ah, got it! CapCut is a popular video editing app that allows users to create and edit videos easily on their mobile devices. It offers a range of features such as adding music, applying filters, adding text, and more, making it a versatile tool for creating content. It's widely used for editing short videos for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Amazing, until the update. This was an amazing app, and i used it for all my editing needs, but then they added a recent update, and its just caused the app to be glitchy, slow and wont play the video, especially if you've added smooth slow motion. It was way better before, and i will probably be changing apps now."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVED CapCut! I made tons of edits for my friend's birthdays and for myself and let me tell you, it's SO FUN to use! Super easy and lots of free options, beautiful transitions and templates, even the watermark isnt annoying. (unlike other editors) I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves editing, beginner or advanced."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very nice but it can be very laggy. And I tried to use a template but it always shows ""templates will appear here"" but they never do. It's stupid. Another thing I hate is when your moving a overlay there is like a wall so it doesn't let me move exactly where I want it. Effects are nice but they make the video so laggy for no reason. And if you wanna use a sound you have to extract is from your camera roll which takes up lots and lots of space if you do edits a lot. So I like it but theres issues"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DOES NOT EXPORT THE VIDEOS EVEN IF I HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE AND NO PROBLEM WITH MY PHONE. I ALSO CLEARED CACHE BUT STILL NONE.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is good and works well for me,I've had this app on my phone and it has been my main editting app. I started struggling with the storage on my phone and have started moving things to my tablet and wanted to do so with this app aswell. I can find it when I look it up on the app store which led to my conclusion that it isn't for tablets and I'm really disappointed because now I have to switch apps and get used to another one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since you keep Taking things from normal capcut I can barely do anything now, And I am not going to pay for a app just to make videos. And I am not a capcut creator, I have no intention in doing it, all I do is send my friends vids, But guess what I cant do that without paying :/"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I honestly think it's really great for a free app and for people who don't understand editing or are beginners to editing, one slight issue I've had it that when I slow down a clip the hue slightly adjusts? Like it turns more redish-pink for some reason which I find very odd, except for some lag here and there (when you add too many effects) this app is amazing for being free and all!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This would be my favourite app if they fixed this issues.... I'm using a OnePlus 9 Pro. Once I've uploaded various images and I use the auto option to create the compilation, it's a nightmare changing the length of time the viewer sees each photo. I simply want to make each photo the same length of time, but it's near impossible to do it. Is it my device, or the app? No idea. But it's the only app that I'm struggling to use"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. Since tried it. i decided to used is as permanent video editor. The updated version is great!! But I hope you add, MERGE AUDIO and VIDEO. Just to share my experience as a public social vlogger, I use to seperately take video and audio and combine it post editing. There's a little bit hard to adjust dragging the audio and video if before I convert I think add some video then all of adjustment will be repeated again. I hope you notice this! thankyou verymuch."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything about this app is alright, but the ‚ÄúNow & Then‚Äù transition doesn't work right. At least make separate transitions instead of getting 2 of them into 1. Now, my whole edit is ruined, because I can't have an exact transition from ‚ÄúNow & Then‚Äù that I want. Make 2 separate transitions (or at least pick 1 of them that are commonly used by the CapCut users) instead of making us editors confused with everything. Might move on to another editing software if this doesn't get fixed immediately."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's gone bad with the latest updates. It's a disgrace. Whenever I add an effect, it lags or slows down. I don't know if it's the application or the phone, but there is no lag on iPhones. My phone is Android. Why does the video lag on my phone, especially when I add effects? Please solve this problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use this app because it was very smooth no lag but now it's so laggy to the fact some pictures will appear faster or slower than what I set it to. The text won't even show up now, So I just exported images of text for a short video like 20 secs of just a recording. I finished exporting and the text didn't even show up nor the music which is from the app itself."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love it, very useful to edit a video for uploading problems. But, i have one problem, whenever we use it too long or make a video that have so many accessories, example: using too much effect, too many splits and long durations. It make it lags, please fix this, I will change my rate to 4, I promise."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been using Capcut from 3 years no doubt it has given me a perfect experience I am still using it for my YOUTUBE shorts after the recent update the UI and new features are awesome but add an option to control the pitch of voice that is generated after text to speech and auto captions. Many users have also complained about Auto captions and auto lyrics are no longer working for them kinldy resolve it. Thanks
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app in general but it's could have a bit better stuff the pro mode I've got lots of pro stuff so not so good but it's in general it's good
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi! Firstly, I would like to say how much I enjoy using this app. I mean, it has all the things you need as an editor and I've been using it for a long time now. Mostly for its smooth slow-mo feature. But, recently, I have noticed that when I use the ""better quality"" option to make my slow motion smoother, it no longer make it flow into each frame. Like it stopped working or something. I tried un-installing and re-installing the app, but it didn't help. But, overall, the app is good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ok three things that need fixing and improvement 1. Why are my projects getting corrupted for no apparent reason. I cant export anything and even if I do I cant even view my project 2. Shake mechanics such as being able to make x and y shakes needs to be added along with some new 3d and 2d text effects ( people would love this ) along with some new 3d effects pls 3. Audio beats are glitching for some apparent reason Note: Overall its a good app but these are the problems I encountered
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good quality. Just wish Pro cost only $20 to get the full thing. It is full on retard that it cost $75 a year and you don't even get to keep the product forever. Monthly plans are greedy. Especially when there isn't much great that Pro offers that the free version doesn't already have. Gifs and other effects are nice, but it isn't at all worth $75 a year without permanent ownership of the product. That's such a scam."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Theres alot of problem in this app now when they started a whole new interface, its been buggier and buggier in every update they made, sometimes when I edit my screen freezes and sometimes when I download that is more than 1gb It will be stuck up in the 99percent bar then suddenly it will crash and that have made me gave this app now a 1 star review."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm done with this app it has script to video to where you can write things out and have it put into a video. You're supposed to be able to add your own photos. It'll let me add one photo, then tell me I need to allow permission for cap cut to access photos. I've already given permission, and it it won't let me use any more photos. I've uninstalled and cleared the settings, and it still acts up."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut was such a great app when it was free and now their bringing this Capcut ""pro"" into the picture. I can't really make edits to fullest ability because of this, so please bring back the old Capcut"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give this 5 stars but since I can only upload GIFS as stickers, I'm giving it four. You can't do much with stickers unlike clips, which is really sucky for me when I want to make an edit and have GIFS in it. Capcut team, please treat GIFS as if they were videos, other than that, I 100000% recommend to anyone looking for an easy to use video editor. I was able to understand and know how to use the app fairly quickly and it's not complicated! Also, there aren't any annoying ads!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Broo I can't search for template anymore it just keep saying ""couldn't load tap to try again"" it just been this for months for me I'm so frustrated and mad at the same time I want to search for template with my friends and its just like that can't load even if my wifi is not weak pls fix this I want to edit some stuff"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really nice very good app I love it üî• editing very good and tamplete very good üòä
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,What is this app is the best when it comes to creating from a Creator's aspect it is essential that you get the right videos that you want to convey to your audience and your followers and this is a perfect example of a great app so let's get with it install it and start creating content
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not a review, but why do some people on this app (Google Play Store) have their own faces as their profile picture? What, were you guys not getting bullied enough?? üòÇüòÇ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the concept of a free editing app with many options for transitions and the optional watermark. This definitely lives up to all of that. The thing is, though, it's kinda bugged out. The app crashes if you add to many overlays and crashes sometimes. Other than that, I love it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app the only problem i have with it is that whenever i move my images or videos to a differnt album, it deletes my work! I was working on a video and i tried sorting my clips into another album and it deleted my work, i had spent 5 hours on it and it all got deleted, i want this to be fixed. Other than that it is an amazing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good only thing is missing is an AI video ending where it cuts out Dead air or silence.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cant export videos,audio,photos in my edit video, I try fixing it but it won't work,also can't export the video template Please fix this problem,this happen wheni installed ui 6"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely amazing, it isn't bombarded by ads, or any pay walls. I absolutely love this app and I've shared it with my friends and they love it just as much as me. The auto caption feature is exceptionally useful for gaming videos, the transitions and effects are perfect for tiktoks and Instagram videos. Its just an absolutely perfect app for editing. I rate it 10/10"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When the update started it got more worse than I expected, even though my wifi is good, I still have to wait several minutes to get the template finished"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app, but sometimes the videos don't load when you add them in projects. Also, the reverse video option glitches. The video is in reverse, but it ends up glitching a good chunk of it, which turns out pretty bad. Other than that, no other complains really thus far."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a really good app and have many creative and cool features and I made many edits on it but I rated 2 stars because when I make an edit and everything is perfect but when it's time to put the animations the video goes crazy and the time slows and then goes fast and the overlays is on another clips it just ruin my videos and this really bothers me . I thought the problem was from my phone but I checked my internet and free up much space but still the same . So please fix this pleeeeeeeeease
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use butttt DO NOT BUY ANY IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS. I purchased pro. At first, I could use it and it was fine. 2 months ago I noticed something was wrong but I assumed it was a glitch seeing the apps been glitching a lot lately. I've been using the TikTok to edit. 10 days ago I noticed it still was glitching..long story short, I've been getting no help just computer generated messages. I couldn't cancel it until I uninstalled the app. Then I was able to cancel subscription."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The recent updates just make it much easier as I don't have to convert GIF into a MP4 video in a website. And the watermark can be removed freely which is very helping people because most people don't buy just to remove watermark, but this app is very helpful! It's actually kinda easy to make a cool edit. Or you can just use someone template! Very nice and easy, I recommend very much. It appease me very well!!üëåüòå"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut has amazing transitions, the effects are incredible, and I can easily make anime edits. There's no obnoxious pricing that I run into a lot. Honestly, its like a dream come true. In the future I hope to see more animation options for text, and maybe a bit more to the tweening but overall my experience with this app was amazing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"To be honest , im the earlier user capcut that app doesn't need to pay the effect or tools in the app . Now days the regular effect also change to PRO and need to pay that stuff . I'm just wanna switch with other app that better"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good editing app, but I think the new update is making it so (I at least) can't use all my photos in my camera roll, which sucks because I've used this for a long time, and also having pro just sucks because it's doesn't do you any good besides give you extra stickers and transition (and track you because you need a personal account), Please fix it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Capcut was perfect then the moment the update that changed exposure to brilliance and sound Effect to FX happened everything is just ruined üò≠üò≠üò≠ please I want to go back to exactly before that update. 3 stars cause I used to love the app but 1 star for the current reality
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it was so fun and good at first. then I wanted to make a very simple video edit and nothing would stay where I wanted it and the video kept speeding up and slowing on its own. I couldn't fix the speed issues because it said everything was normal. So much potential that went to absolute garbage if you're not using a template
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Who ever says this app is bad they must be drunk caus the editing is high quality and i just love it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Developers, please read! It's an amazing app, and all my edits or videos are done on here, but I have a slight problem. After a few days of not using the app (like 2 or 3 days), I can't re-open it, and it just shuts down! I check for updates and guess what, no updates available so I'm a bit annoyed at that because I have done everything to try fix it myself but the only way it has worked is to uninstall it and re-install but then I lose all my videos. Please fix this and I will rate it 5 stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great for editing! I use it for all of my videos. They're constantly adding new things, but the app isn't overcomplicated, and it's great for beginning and advanced editors. Also, this is the only editing app that's completely free, has no ads and you allows you to remove the watermark. I love it and I totally recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a long time and tell me why it's suddenly glitching out like no tomorrow. audios being cut out, the cover feature isn't working, it skips when you try to just play a video. it's annoying small glitches like that that make this app a little less fun to use, but beside that it's a really good and effective app, but the glitches are nottt helping."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I gave it a three because every time I try and put screenshots together it brings me to the end where you know it puts like the transition for the app at the end? Anyway, I press on it and it makes the video longer than needed and makes it like 64 minutes at the highest for me and 34 at the lowest. And I have to press undo I have tried to see what what wrong but I have no clue! I have reinstalled the app multiple times only for it to get worse and not letting me export the video. It's annoying"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to LOVE this app. I used it all of the time for your typical stuff. This was until recently when the app wouldn't open at all. I force stopped it, closed it out then reopened, cleared cache, restarted my phone, etc. It just won't stop crashing. Then, before that, it lagged really badly and glitched all of the time. I would hate to have to switch apps as this one is my favorite."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I rated this a 5 star because, This app is very good for editing. You can even choose your videos you record and add them from any app! And you can press on templates and click on a video/edit you want or like and then add videos/photos and then you can press save and see your edit! But one thing I do not like about this app is, you sometimes need to download images from google/chrome. It's really annoying sometimes because it wastes the storage on your device! Tho this app is still pretty good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely amazing couldn't be any better for editing and creating videos. I haven't used the app for to long and ever since I got it I've fallen in love with it. Even that being said there are a couple things that could be better like for example adding more music apps that are compatible with the app. I use an app called Tidal for music and when I try to add any music from there it say file not supported. So I spent almost 3 hours figuring out how to convert it into mp3 files.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is way too buggy. If you use the app for a prolonged period audio will move, texts disappear, sound doesnt play right, video playback will randomly speed up at parts...its incredibly aggravating. This app is only good for very basic use, otherwise you're going to pull your hair out trying to utilize the actual features and layering overlays."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why can't I see my videos once I move my videos to a different folder on my photo album? As in like they dissappear and vanish even though the same video still in my album there's no way of recovery. Please fix this issue. It takes me hours to edit as a full time content creator. Can you please add Jesse, trickster etc voices when we record voiceovers directly in capcut, it's already on tiktok but it be a great integration if it was also on capcut , not just the text voiceover option"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ive been using this for 2 years now and it was working fine. But then, i have 1 problem with the app. If i want to put text, stickers, overlay etc. I cant put it in the center because of the blue line!!!!!! So if you guys can fix it or i recommend to get rid of it, i will change my rating to 5. But overall, this app was amazing and the best editing app EVER!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very excellent editing app plenty of templates for the average editor to enjoy thank you.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like capcut. It used to be a bit boring bc it did not have a lot of effects and did not have any templates. But now it all has changed, it's more fun when there's also a social media in cap cut w templates. Now that it all changed, I really like capcut now, also new effects. Sometimes, when I do an edit and I upload it, it takes long to load, even when there is no connection, but capcut is still my fav editing app, PLS ü§ì"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been editing on capcut for 2 years and its one of the best app that I've tried. You can do a lot of things, like creating templates or use them or even create your own video. It's not too laggy. But i have to say that they should put the 4k quality on android too. the updates always make things better like the graphs on the effects that I've been waiting for so long... Best app fr!! Totally recommend it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was a great app and Ive been using it for 2 years now, although the bugs is a problem, whenever I edit and added many effects on my video it always stops, and when I play it so that I can check how many effect works it always stop and glitches, it's annoying, and it's hard for me to time where exactly do I put my transition because it always glitches, and among the effects aren't working and just stops, I have to exit the app and use it after, and forgot what should I do for my edit."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this is the best editing app! it has sooo many features and it's also easy to use :) The only problem that i have for this is that whenever I'm editing a video, it's really really laggy when i preview/play it. It really bothers me while editing a video and gives me a very hard time. I really hope that you can fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app for using English, but not so great when using other languages. It completely messes up when you type in Perso/Arabic script. It is such a shame coz so many people use it but can benefit from the text option in those languages. Great app tho. Just not compatible. Really hope they fix the issue. It types in reverse and scrambled order when you use Farsi for example. FIX IT PLEASE."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is usually amazing, easy to use and export, but just within the last few days, every project I make becomes corrupted. Even if I just enter 2 photos and save the project. Nothing is wanting to work. I don't understand what is going on with the app, but I sincerely hope they fix it soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is quite good in making videos for the project and compiling pictures.The effect was good and its easy to use . Their are many effects that might give freshness towards the main content. Everytime I use it their is a new discovery and a lot of templates that are able to use freely but some of which needed to pay or ask permission towards the owner
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fixing my review. Many things are still bad about this app. NO watermark Is a great thing but there's so many inconveniences and errors in the app. 1. The text now has a pause after every line you type. Basically if you go down a line the text to speech makes a weird pause out of nowhere. Also the text is still glitchy, app lags when there's 5+ overlays and doesn't display it. Also make the snap to grid thing optional! Istg it's so annoying and it makes percise movements impossible. Good app tho"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"idk if it's just because of my phone, but whenever I export videos that I have edited and set it on the highest quality there is that's available, it takes so long and make my phone quite laggy at the process, so that lag also causes the exportation of the video to take longer. but overall it's a really great video editing app, would highly recommend. giving 5 star's nonetheless."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is very frustrating, I have a pretty powerful phone and capcut can barely handle processing anything over 30 seconds long, and I've used other apps that work smoothly. As a content creator, not being to view my videos in real time because the editor can't keep up is very frustrating, the app it's self isn't hard to use, it just can't handle anything."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this editing app it is so easy to use and by far the best editing app on phone
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: the app barely works anymore & they've done nothing to fix it. I have the paid version. Haven't been able to make a video, keeps freezing mid project & such a waste of time, who do we contact? Update: Getting more and more disappointed with this app, which I paid for. December update, this app still is not functioning properly, very difficult to edit, freezes, can't view edits when shortening clips. What's going on here, it's been months now"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I Love the app I have it on my xiaomi pad 5 if only theres a one time payment
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great editor, I like it better than ones I've paid for in the past. It's the only free editor I've seen that isn't missing any of the basic editing necessities, and it can beat out most of the paid ones in features too, like it let's you edit every color individually (hsl,) for example. I'm a fan and it's the only editor I use on mobile anymore."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like capcut but there are a few things Firstly, when ever I export a video and re-import it to reduce lag on the actual main video, it completely lags that video it freezing one of the frames making it useless. It gets really laggy and the new update with the effects has mad either so confusing to find the effects you want, please add a key-word thing to find the right effects or a search bar. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for almost 3 years now and it's a great editing app! However, I do have one small problem. Everytime I do a velocity edit and the video has a coloring the video flashes colors to the coloring to the original one. Sorry if I don't make senseüòÖ I'd like to know if there is a way to fix this or it's just my phone."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app alot! I just have a few things that can make this app a bit better. One, you can search for the sound file you are looking for, I have trouble looking for a song for a video but can't find it. And 2, sort the files by last modified or last added or something like that, because I don't like finding files through alphabetical order. I love this app a lot like I said, But thanks for reading this Love, diamondstep"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely incredible. I've been using it for some months now, and it's has the most amazing video transitions and animations, along with many amazing effects and more! The part that stuns me the most about this incredible gift of a video editing platform is that all of or us free, and with 1080p 60fps exports! Would highly recommend!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good editing app. It's free, it's easy to use, it's got good transitions and stuff. However, I'm experiencing issues with audio. The audio seems to be going faster than it should be going when I'm trying to make sure everything is on beat and I have no idea what's going on. The app has crashed a couple of times in the past week as well. Audio issues still are happening."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok for editing, but it isn't convenient and a bit annoying. First, thr animations section i s unorganized in arrangement (e.g why does type 2 come before type 1). Second, the search fonts feature is useless. I typed in ""Bebas"" and many fonts EXCEPT for Bebas shows up, the font exists so why isn't it there?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app it is very easy to use but, since the new update exporting issues have increased. When I export it sometimes replaces the whole video with a black screen and keeps audio or it plays audio and has a weird green purple color moving on the screen. I started editing vidsbfor clients but when the update happend I lost up to $40 worth of work due to exportation issues. So please revert back to what it was before the last update or two, and try implementing things from a different angle"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At first this app was excellent. But after a period of time it does not work properly . Every time when I click on effects,filters ,motions or any other way to edit (editing) it start showing that ""NO INTERNET CONNECTION "". However my internet connection and its signals are excellent even all the other apps which work on internet are working greatly except for "" capcut"". This is the major problem I'm facing in using this app."

I hope they are able to add more updates soon though."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, the only problem I see here is the immense amount of lag. Every time I try to create a video and press play, it would just freeze and play the music but not the video. Also when exported, the video has a delay due to this issue, to me it would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the performance issues but an almost perfect app overall."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE this app! My cousin and I have made so many homemade movies using cap cut! Easy to use, no adds at all, and you can use almost everything without paying (you have to pay for ai written scripts). Super fun and easy. I recommend cap cut for any one who likes making movies.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is one of the best so far editing apps in my opinion. Capcut has very good quality. Though there is one thing wrong with Capcut, When ever I have a video longer then 30 seconds it tends to glitch around 10 seconds of the video. There is one more problem with the app when you install, Sometimes I have to delete Capcut to get other apps but I'll always reinstall it, When I try to reinstall Capcut it tells me I can't install Capcut after it loads to 99% percent. Over Capcut is a good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is absolutely fantastic but it is quite annoying that I have to either get pro or share it with other people to get a filter I want. If there could be less of these offers then this would be a 5 star review. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really? Capcut??? Fr everytime I edit my it goes EXTREMELY laggy. I deleted the app and I'm not gonna use it anymore, can't even edit videos smoothly. Plus capcut made the soundtrack EXTREMELY laggy and they never fixed it. The app is good but it's extremely laggy, do I HAVE to start all over again and reset the app everytime I rewind the last clip? Nahhh idk if it's my device or not but I've seen people have many problems with the app being laggy on YouTube."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 stars. Just a tiny flaw when editing. When I make a mini montage using the shortcut feature and then go to project, the scrub reel is blank, which makes editing difficult as I can't adjust the individual clip size with it irreverably botching the entire thing. When adding stuff to the clips like a filter I also cannot change filter value without it kicking me back to the top."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I honestly find this the best easiest editing app that I understand to use. I'm just very confuse what happen to the templates? I suddenly am not able to watch any templates. I use/watch templates videos in capcut very very often and it's really good for me to get ideas to edit. Now I am not able to do that can you please fix whats happening? At the bottom of the screen has no buttons usually there is the profile and etc I forgot the other but there's non anymore?
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Yes, this app is good, it's just that the glitches make me mad. I am trying to work on an edit video and when I press reverse, it kicks me out the app. Capcut also never fixed this mistake where you make a video and it starts to lag a little. This affects when my next clip is on the exact beat and time when you want it. Capcut just needs to fix there bugs and it'll be a 5 star"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is awesome since it has many templates that you can use for editing your videos, but it's very heavy which makes the app lagging so much while editing some video that has slow motion effects in it. It was good at the very beginning but after several updates, it became slower to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a cool app and all but.. Why. Why did you delete my progress? I was making a video which took me to stay up at night to finish, and then at the morning when I woke up I started working on it again. But then, after I made the thing and it started lagging. I restarted capcut but I couldn't see my video ANYWHERE. I couldn't even see the progress that I made. Now I cannot finish the video I was making. Seriously, please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is good in terms of editing and animating the photos and videos, but when I delete a photo the app tells me that It can't show the image because it has been moved or deleted. In my situation it has just been moved and I took 3 weeks making this project, yet because of one tiny movement I've just wasted 3 weeks on this app trying to make good content. If you could fix this problem I'd rate it 5 Stars no problem whatsoever."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app overall is amazing üëè very well made and editing gets made so easy. I also have made a lot of cool videos with all types of transitions one thing, tho is that when the pro transition makes you not able to send it to anybody that is the only thing I don't like because there is no adds for me during it and the music is spot on thanks. Letters =357"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love how this app is completely free. I do have a question, why can't whenever I trim, apply to all the others? I also can't animate overlays or rotate them like I can with a sticker. Those are really my only problems. This app has helped me become a better video editor. 10/10 would recommend to any new video editor, looking for a great app, that's completely free, and that's really easy to use, with really great features."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really do adore CapCut cause you can do so much if you learn new things or watch tutorials and it's really nice for beginners! However it's just not a fantastic app sometimes it's slow when you are working on a project and when you export it's lagged behind a audio even though it lined up in CapCut so it's really irritating sometimes. Other then that I think the app is good for Android users since we don't have like video star.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App has been doing really well for me. I use to do covers with this app cause it let's you combine multiple audios.

I'm kinda frustrated because I put a lot of effort in the video, but it turns out to be like that. What makes me more frustrated is that you know the problem is common (hell, you even put it in the feedback section), but you do nothing to solve it. I'm sorry I have to rate you 1 star, Capcut. Do better."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app because it's so easy to use and beginner friendly. There's often glitches but no big deal. I just wanted to say that i really wish there could be a function were you can change the duration of the clips in one time (for mobile because I know that function is available on desktop ver.) just because it's so time wasting and frustrating to manually adjust clips specially when there are a lot. So could you guys please add this function to mobile too?
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Hey capcut I just wanna say you have such a wonderful feature! Like it's amazing!!

I'm able to create a new 'edit' and add either a photo or video but then it won't allow me to click on any photo/video that has been added. It's also not playing when I click play so I'm basically on a ""frozen screen"" the entire time because it doesn't let me do anything and I've checked for updates but it doesn't need any. Please try to fix this capcut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The editing is great; second to none. I give 4 stars only because after I completed my edit the file began exporting literally all night and when I woke up this morning exporting was at 89% and my low storage icon was on so when I went to free up space the exporting stopped and now I have to start the export all over. P.S the only apps I deleted to free up space was IG and several large games all of which had nothing to do with CapCut or the file that was exporting. Worth 5 stars otherwise.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well, CapCut is the best video editor app I've ever had. Its features are excellent and you can remove the watermark for free in the end of the video. But the update needs to be fixed, because the compressing feature when you select videos takes long depending on the time speed of the video. But overall, this is a nice app for TikTok shortcuts and editing. ^^"

Is there a way that you could add those back and keep them instead of removing other effects ?

When I was in the process of editing, the video match very well with the audio. But once I save it to my gallery, the video are not in sync anymore unlike when I was editing it.

So, when moving around texts or images or videos, there should be an option to turn off auto adjust where it doesn't automatically set to the middle of the video. If you could do that for your next update, I would appreciate a lot."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is such a good app for editing, obviously. It has so many features and you can make such sick edits. The effects are so, I mean so good, I'm not even gonna lie. The animations are simple, but the Pro animations are so good too. I'd actually like to buy the Pro membership(?) but since I've been using this app for years, I'm able to be satisfied with my own edits without the animations. I highly recommend this app. It's super easy to use, and even easier when you learn more."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great app, really! But I've been having this problem for a while now where the audio plays at a normal pace but the video is lagging. So when I want to replay it to see if I'm happy with it, I am not sure if I am because of the laggy video. I am not able to edit properly because of this issue. If you could fix this problem then I would give it 5 stars :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a really good app! the only thing i wish you could change is the moving thing it does on your photos. I don't really know how to explain it but I'll try. You're trying to move your photo slightly, and the app moves it all the way to that way. it also does this vibration on your phone. it's kind of annoying, so my future advice is to have a feature where you can turn this setting off and on."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of the worst editing apps I've ever use. Do you know the pain of finishing up a video of 9 minutes. You are positive things worked out even though the app itself has a HUGE lagging issue that it won't resolve. But you set the issue aside because you are done with editing a video for YOUTUBE. And you spend an entire HOUR exporting the video. Only for there to be mistakes that you CLEARLY edited out. The desktop version is just even worse that the phone version. This app is sad to editors‚óè
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this! But the editing is a bit practical and hard to understand so please maybe if you could add a understand feature then it would be 5 stars.

I tried to check and see if I needed to update anything but i don't the app is just not working itself. If you could fix this that would be great. Also I see some other 2 reviews also and if you could fix what they have to that would be amazing. And maybe try leveling up making things go faster. Thanks."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is pretty good but sometimes it laggs and it is hard to work with other times it is amazing. The app sometimes likes to delete my clips or pictures/videos I have saved to my phone and I don't like that but other than that it is a good app. When I export my edits it likes to freeze on random parts of the video it also got way more expensive with the PRO version of it and since it started the PRO thing it has gotten more laggy I think they should get rid of the PRO thing.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would've rateted it higher only if I didn't come across this issue where it won't let me get through the exporting phase of finishing up my edit.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've only used it twice but I must say that the editing tools in this app is pretty neat as compared to free version of VSDC on my laptop. There's limited effects to choose from though but can be a decent app for a newbie in video editing like me. I also love the background remover feature which can be useful in changing the background of the original video.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's an alright app, but there is a glitch where when you reopen your project after at least a day, some or all of the clips will be deleted, and you can't restore them, because there is also this glitch where when you go to add your clips, it doesn't show all of your clips from your camera roll there, even when you allow it in settings."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, a (semi) perfect editing app. Would recommend to everyone. Why am I giving it 3 stars? It's because of ONE thing, the delay after I export a video. This is really annoying to me and probably to every editors out there. The video audio is delayed for some reason. Capcut owners, please please please fix this! Or at least just respond to this, I want an answer! If you guys fix this issue I'm having or give me a tip on how to fix this, I will rate it 5 stars.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app but my phone always glitching that I can't even move anything because it doesn't work sometimes and it just makes me so mad of it, to be honest with this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They must do something about ONLY FEW/SOME files that are corrupted to a video that is being edit. The whole ongoing video being edit should be open so that the only corrupted files are the only ones for the editors to fix. I hope you can do something about it because our time, efforts, etc, are only wasted if the whole video cannot be opened. It's upsetting. Or at least do alternative way for us so that we can revive what we are editing."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ok ok its a good app yes. The reason for 3 starts is beacuse when i crop a video it downgrades the quality of the video. Sometimes when I am finished with an edit the video turns out choppy or the video freezes during the edit. My last problem is when I add sounds it is very choppy and that is not beacuse I cut the sound or anything beacuse its a complaint that many other people have on there reviews.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For approximately two years, I have been using Capcut, and it has proven to be an excellent application with a wide range of effects and features, making it my top pick. Nevertheless, I came across an issue that has had a significant impact on my editing and that of others. Capcut has a feature called Style, which is supposed to have various effects. However, I am not able to access all of them, despite updating the app. This problem needs to be resolved as soon as possible please and thank you."

But now it doesn't and it's very annoying. Please fix this I can't wait for a very long time to start ""editing""."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They made fade in on text animations pro. It's ery upsetting since it's the only one I have ever used for the past 2 years.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have only used this a few times to edit cosplay tiktok videos. I love how this a free. A lot of video editors arent free and that makes me upset bc I'm a child and cant pay monthly fee. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is bc it glitches so much. While checking the video while editing the audio goes and the video just stops. After I export the video some of the glitches are in the video after. My phone has lots of space and I tried re opening the app and nothing is helping.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great, but I gave it a 4 star cause I want more effects and movement.

I always use this app whenever i have school presentations or if i simply want to have fun with it.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This was a great editor since I was able to edit and export it without watermark, but the problem lies in the video because sometimes some part get lags or hangs.

My text doesnt line up, the video lags a lot and the preview almost never works. The final video never looks the way i make it look within the app. An top of that it takes the video so long to export, just to find out, nothing looks right. The app was great, and could be again if these bugs were fixed."

But it has a rather large draw back which is I have to make the thing I'm doing then download it then re do it all slightly out of time as when you export it it puts the audio and the video out of time, so beat drops and so on are about 1s too early or so which is an annoying thing, apart from that I can't fault it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Amazing overall editing, but saving takes so much time. This application will easily take up 2 GB of storage (1 video edited), and saving the video takes so much time and even crashes at 99%.

When I'm editing the video part of it and I delete a piece I don't need or I add more video onto it, it deletes my text slides? I don't know how to explain that more properly, so I apologize if it doesn't make sense. And I really don't think it's just a feature of the app because it'll work with me sometimes, but then other times, it does this odd glitch. Other than that though, it's a great app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Works fine.. but still lot of things to do to be great.. 1. Auto caption is slow in capcut.. so it will be great if it becomes faster.. 2. Auto caption should have translate function.. i can not translate japanese text to english.. so they should think about translate function.. 3. Video export is also slow.. so it should be faster.. Otherwise capcut is one of the best apps in google play store..

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut has been my favourite video editor for quite some time, however nowadays it has started to become more glitchy. For example, when i try to reverse a clip, it just plays a different part of my project. It also becomes very laggy with projects 100MB+. And even for projects below 100MB, clips occasionally are unable to be selected and edited. 5 stars if it weren't for the inconveniences."

Capcut have videos for beginners to give them a basic insight on how some of the features work. There are completely no ads at all. You'll be surprised on how much you can accomplished on this free app. Easily going on A tier, no argument needed."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's the very reliant and useful editor in today's generation. It offers many features which we can use in an easy way. The best thing for me is that we can save the edited videos without a watermark unlike to the other editing apps that need a payment in order to remove it. I already edited many videos with this editor for free. And I highly recommend this to everyone.

Whenever I add clips they get all weird so when I save it and reopen the app is just disappears causing me to redo that one clip again. It's an easy to use app but it still needs to get a lot of bugs fixed."

Whenever im done making an edit and then i import it and then i add this edit to edit it again as a video, it sometimes freeze, it removes some parts of the video like it cuts it and more. I kept Uninstalling it ang reinstalling it but it still doesn't get fixed. Idk if its a bug but PLEASE. fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The editing app in general is ok but there are problems I have with it. Sometimes when you add a song and add the beats to itbthe song will end up not matching with the clips even after you match it up. But when you finally match it up when you export it, it's always off beat. Another problem I have with it is that everytime I export the video will freeze not allowing me to upload to any social media."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for like a month. it was very lovely and convenient so I don't have to pull out my laptop to work on my videos. But just recently it's not working anymore for some reason it could not be connected to the internet. I've tried many times uninstall and reinstalled but still things didn't work at all. So I tried the other way by using VPN then it start to work without it the application keeps saying no internet connection. If you could fix this that would be lovely.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I always use this app for editing, it's really good. But this feature called motion blur does not appear in my screen. I've tried updating it, uninstall it and install it again, nothing works. And also I'd be great if key frames were available for effects too. I'd like to be able to use motion blur. Please and thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app lagges way too much, to the point it's unuseable. When you put text or an overlay on and you exit the project, when you reopen it when it reaches the text or overlay the video will freeze and it can take over 10 seconds to catch up. Then the text will also become this straight block of whatever colour you've chosen which becomes incredibly frustrating as you have to type out the whole text again"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With capcut's recent update, I have been really really disappointed. Yes, the features and tools are working but when I wanted to add more video or photos to my project IT JUST DOESN'T. And when I try to export my UNFINISHED PROJECT (because I cannot import more videos) IT ALSO CAN'T EXPORT. WHY CAPCUT?? I'm reall really disappointed. Also, I've checked if it's my phone or not, no, it's definitely not my phone's problem."

NO TEMPLATES WHAT DO I DO??? HOW DO I FIND THEMMM!?!?! üò≠ l'm not that good at editing but l've been trying it's going well BUT. I NEED THOSE CAPCUT TEMPLATES!!üò≠
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app at first, everything was going smoothly and I had access to lots of things, until the 'pro' feature. The pro feature isn't the worst problem, because I can work my around. What's my main concern is the lag. When I add videos the videos glitches and doesn't load. At the rate it's at I have no clue why I haven't deleted it yet. I can't make edits if I can't add videos for overlay effect, or reverse? My signature editing style down the drain? I need to figure out alight motionüòí"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a nice app, helped me in editing a lot and has the best features. But since yesterday, it has been glitching a lot. I try to make an edit and something automatically kicks me out of the app, and when I dowload a video the same thing happens, all which I've been editing for a long time goes in waste. Also when I try to type something in Urdu in order to add a text it doesn't work, I need you guys to fix this please! Thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for over a year now but I've not had time to review it. I won't lie, this is the best video editing mobile application. It has everything you need as far as you know what you are looking for and how to go about it. Not even to say now that they have added photo editing and AI image generator. This is now moreoless a multi purpose app. You can even use it for Graphics design and Presentations. You don't even need to worry about your work, it saves automatically."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great editing app. I use it every time I need to edit something and it does its job perfectly. I just wish there was an option where you go straight to your music gallery so you can pick a song that you already have on your device. Otherwise, I have to download a video with the music I want to put in the video every time and it gets annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So, I've been using Capcut for as long as I can remember. Ever since I started my YouTube channel and used this Video editor, I've been getting a lot of views even tho my vids are bad that time bc I was still new to it, but I got used to it fast, bc it's easy to use. Although there are some little problems, like when you try to rotate the text back to 0 again, it's hard to put it back. That's my only problem. Overall I rate this app 5 stars bc why not?"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is not good at all. The animations tag kept lagging, and whenever I went into cutout and removed my background (it was a very clear picture üñºÔ∏è) it just left the tiniest piece of the picture. I thought if the background cutout didn't work maybe the chroma (for greenscreen) would. It didn't. If you are reading this review and are interested in a better editing app, I suggest video_guru. It's greenscreen tool works so nicely and the last time it lagged for me was years ago. Byeeeeeeeeeeee"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all until I made literally ""tiny"" mistake. So this video, I'm supposed to cut it cause is was a lil bit too long and all that left of the cut was a 0.3(?) second of it. And I kept tapping on that 0.3 leftout cut of the video tobe deleted only to found out that I'm still tapping at the button to put transition to instead of the video. The button was too big to put my finger on the video and it got kinda annoying that I have to do the editing process from square one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, I think this is the best video editing app on a phone. Thanks to this app, I was able to successfully make a virtual presentation for a school project. Keep it up! However, there's one negative thing. When I put transitions in my overlay, some of them disappear for no reason. Hope that gets fixed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,every single time i use this app it gets worse if i could give it less stars i would at first it was just glitching and then it made the audio fuzzy and then it started picking and choosing which videos i could edit

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app it helps me edit and the template feature is very helpful for lazy editors, but the problem is that can you make a rotation and zoom in feature, like I want to rotate something without making it bigger it's really hard to do meme animation if that happens, second. can you make a setting to turn on and off for the blue line its sometimes annoying but sometimes it helps me line up a pic, I hope you make this idea of mine"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good editing app! It has lots of features but is quite difficult to use at first. it's very hard to resize things by dragging the edges because if you drag it even close to the edge of your screen, it just shoots in that direction and it's very hard to control. Edit: back to 4 stars cuz they fixed the text"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app a lot. But it can be a add a few more feature(just suggestions). Like the DRAWING PEN. As we have key frames now, if we have the DRAWING PEN icon, we could do the writing or a line becoming a heart kind of stuffs. Also, I transitions if you could add the BUTTERFLY TRANSITION (like a butterfly flying and the clip changes to the other kind. I hope you can understand). Over all, this is the best editing app in the world!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a versatile video editing application with a user-friendly interface that caters well to both beginners and experienced editors. One area for improvement would be to add support for languages such as Arabic and Urdu to make the app more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of users. By incorporating these languages into the app, CapCut can better serve its growing international user base and enhance the overall user experience for speakers of these languages."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Eh, I typically use a full video editing suite to edit stuff but I wanted to do something quickly on my phone. Apparently the text and backgrounds can't be set to go all through the video, so my edit was messed up. Good for quick stuff like cropping and adding in some effects, though I personally would not edit for long even on my phone with a huge screen."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really good editing software and I use it to edit most of my videos. But unfortunately I had to bump it down to 4 stars because there is a glitch on the brush and wipe when removing the background and all. When I tried making a green screen it moved the place a bit to the right and it annoyed me alot. Please fix. Otherwise. It's very good
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is such a big help for me editting videos. It made my video editting experience more easier.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, it was easy to use and I could make edits quick & easy. Now not only are even the most basic effects hidden behind a paywall but the glitches are somehow WORSE. This app is going downhill fast. Considering there are better editing apps out there for significantly less money with MORE overall, I'm not sure how worth it Capcut is anymore. Especially since they're prioritizing locking everything behind a paywall rather than fixing basic glitches."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a long time now and works very well for me. It is very intuitive and versatile. The only thing I don't know is how to lock the clips in place. Because if I want to delete the clips in the front, all clips after that moves and it messes up all the timings of the clips. Please help."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A pretty good app in my opinion, its pretty easy to learn how to use the app, tons of great stuff that help make your video much better. Its super good but sometimes the videos i try to edit end up being glitchy while I'm editing and sometime the video comes out, not the way I wanted it to. Although it does happen, it won't always happen. It's a great app and I do recommend using it if your just starting out on editing or just looking for an easy to use app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app,but theres one thing that honestly annoys me whenever I'm trying to make an edit, like recently I made an edit and I was super proud of it and almost finished. I realized I was losing storage so I backed up every thing on my Google photos account, then I went back to finish the edit and all my photos were gone and I couldn't add them because they weren't on my device. I honestly love this app but it would definitely be better if it had access to google photos to make it easier."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It doesn't allow bilingual captioning it seems in the free version and there is no apparent way to upgrade to a paid version.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"love this app so much, it is my main editing app and I use this app alot. but one problem about it, is that when you try to make a clip as short as possible, it sometimes turns the clip black and you cant edit any further, this makes you restart again, recommend to fix this for a better experience. despite that, the app is still good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I rate this with 3 stars. I find this very simple to edit but the disanvantages about using this is when Im going to adjust effects and transitions It's too laggy when i play the video. I find it very hard to maintain its stability after that I can't open the video that i edited, i don't know why although I kept on working and fixing it still I couldn't fix properly. I hope the creators will see and fix for the soft adjustments but overall this editing app is the best if it's not laggy :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for not a long time now and I still need to learn more but I want an update where you can remove the magnet when you want to put it in the middle because when you want something not to be in the middle, but only slightly, it just magnets it in the middle with just a slight movement near it and that really annoys me sometimes. Please add this feature"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it was terrible the template option disappeared instantly so we couldn't do anything do not install it is rubbish

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Heyy! I've been using this app for two years and does its purpose. My only problem is everytime it crashes it will reset your work and you need to start all over again. To be honest it gives really good templates and you can share it to different social media platforms which is very convinient to use. Some apps take a really long time to use but with capcut with some simple selects you have your work! Still recomend it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a very good editor,no cap, but a very disturbing issue with it is the glitch it displays with words,whenever you make auto captions and select spring animation,it's so annoying,if it can be fixed,i will install it back again,for now am using another editor Plus this new update sucks,you can't even adjust the sharpen,if you do,it changes automatically to HSL. WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING WHEN UPDATING THIS????"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very boring to edit, everything has a limit! I can't drag the letters to where I want, I can't crop the image the way I want, when I drag the letters or anything else on the screen it keeps getting stuck in certain places, I just wish it was smooth! that's the fault of the business that helps you keep things centralized in the middle"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This application is very powerful unlike in any other video editing applications it almost has everything but unfortunately it does not I would very much like to recommend that you put music or audio a folder sorting out, what I mean is that when it comes to picking the audio that I like or at what I have in mind, It really is a time consuming because I have to scroll down very long just to find the audio that I like so please put something so that I can easily find my audio that I like tnx."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"while the app is decent, it still has its quirks. often times when i edit videos, the app will lag and not play properly or kick me out. there was a project i was working on and the app kept bugging until it wouldn't let me edit it especially after i reset my phone or went out of it. i had to lose all my progress when i reinstalled it yet it still wouldn't let me do anything. it's a good app i'll admit but it just needs some fixs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The experience is slightly difficult to use at first but that's fine because they have templates! This is the best editing app I have ever seen! The variety of music, effects and stickers are what make this game a 5 stars! I use it to edit videos that are YouTube worthy and it is very well executed, I have made videos of me and my friends, my pets and my teddies and they all look just as good as eachother! No need to be a professional now!"

But i deleted it a long time ago for a reason, and then when i got it back its still doing the same thing. What it does is after im out of the app for a while and go back in, the edits i did say: ""pictures have been deleted or moved, please check your album,"" and in my gallery the edits are fine, but on Capcut they aren't there anymore and I can't do anything to the edit. Why is it doing this? And is there a way u can fix that?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm sorry to say that but, it's not a really good app to make videos. It almost happens everytime that it doesn't save some scences or it starts to lack. It feels like you could only make like 30 - 45 second videos with it, if you don't want it to crash or something.

The app is so hard to use, I have no clue how to make a new project it keeps asking me to upload old projects that I don't need and when I upload the pictures I wanted to use it won't let me make them into a projet. It was a very nice app to bad I had to uninstall it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great editing app for people who like good edits funny effects and the overlay ability is top notch, my only problem which is why it's only 4 stars is because there is a bug that makes it so you have to edit and export your video in one go because if you dont the app will crash when you try to go back to it and it just wont stop, you can even free up storage and still bad news, but I have to admit that it only does that when you make a long video. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"

I checked and even tried to turn the Wi-Fi off, I also tested it in some other apps and it worked pretty well , so I deleted it and installed it, and I can't even sign in!!! I tried for about a couple time and it still didn't work, I uninstalled and even restarted my phone yet it didn't work. I'm so annoyed i spent 30 minutes for nothing, like fix it"

I spent hours making that video But ended up Crashing :( I hope The bugs and Glitches gets fixed So that i can give this 5 stars!

I've been using capcut for 2 years and I've had a great experience so far, but there are some things that I've had trouble with. 1. The new way to make the text keeps glitching out and saying the same thing twice. 2. It freezes up and my phone says capcut isn't working. 3. The new pictures for the effects are kind of hard to see the effects and I like the old ones better."

I'm not really into the same ones all the time, but it's a great app for sure. And while editing, the video becomes laggy or slow, I'm not sure if that's just me or not, but I think it should be fixed. But here is 4 Stars for the appüòã"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really love capcut, because i think it's an app that so easy to use, and so many features in it. But i really really disappointed, the video and the sound sometimes not sync to each other, and that's made me really hard to continue editing the video, because i have to start over, so the video and the sound can be sync. Please fix this. Please"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey ,I enjoy using your app and it's pretty well optimized.I have a few suggestions that I think would make the app really good for most editors.I think Capcut would have been better if you could use key frames for each effect, animation and many other things that don't have the key frame feature.Like alight motion,for example in the turbulence shake animation,you could make it possible for editors to adjust its effects,like maybe strength,speed.Similar to effects."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Y'all recommend to download this app. Here there's no add when u exporting ur edit. All free. Can use capcut templates. So easy to edit and more good effect. New smooth slowmo update and more. 1 thing I just hate. When u edit new vid and it's like 5-10 yes. It's so long to loading. And after editing. When u gonna export it too long. But it depends on the video. But capcut pls fix it.i mean it's normal. But can u make it fast? But y'all recommend this app to edit
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As soon as I downloaded it it forces you to update it, delivering bad service before even opening the app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In my opinion this is one of the best apps I've downloaded thats for editing since this has no ""app watermarks"" if that makes sense not like other editing apps which has an app watermark. Thought, there are some glitches that happens when I edit a video it lags, or sometimes glitches. But overall I recommend to download this app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very easy to use. Bit today it's not really working, all it is showing is my photos and the videos from my camera roll, not the videos that I downloaded. Wich I find very annoying, I deleted and installed again thinking it would work but no I still doesn't work. And I don't know what to do cause this is the only editing app I know how to use."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When i select voice for my video it don't choice that voice which i select after numerous attempt it selects the right voice
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't allow me to sync cap cut with tik tok where most of the good sounds are üôÅüëé (just remove the function if it works only 1 out of 50 times). Plus the fact that it automatically sets your text or an overlay picture where it wants to is really annoying. You really need to fix this. + whenever you delete photos from your phone, the entire video you made also becomes useless. The pictures don't show up, instead there are empty grey rectangles"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very lag or loading! The longer u edit, the lagger it is! Even worst, the audio would also delay the moment u play ur edit because of the lag!! There will be even glitch! The text would glitch somewhere and disappears! What's more, I couldn't add my pre-recorded audios to the vid which is disappointing. It has some nice features but if it keeps getting my way of editing then I rather use other editing apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the app it's self but there is a lot of missing features that I feel like all editing apps should have. When ever I zoom up on a full stop to make a flicker effect on my edits there are various glitchs that I did not have before. PLEASE FIX THAT. the clips are also very clear in any other app but capcut makes them SUPER blurry. I just hope these problems get fixed asap thankyou

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good app for the most part but has to many glitches example clips freeze for no reason and buffer I had to spend to hours trying to export a video because of it constantly malfunctioning and the reverse button doesn't work for the same clips in the video it'll either say it completely can't reverse or will delete the copied clip I wanted to reverse but exported videos are fine for reversing? I shouldn't have to take all these steps to reverse when the option is right there but it doesn't work

First, I would like to say that if i make animations with capcut, and I use overly a lot well when I pressed the copy button, and then I pressed it replaced because I am doing a animation i expect the overly that I just copied and replaced to be in the same spot it was before but it's not and it is extremely difficult to get it to the same spot I had it before and now my animation looks weird. Please fix this. This and many people like me will be happy. Thank you"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great. There is just something annoying about this app that I and some people find it stressing. When you deleted a permanent video or photo in ur permanent phone in files that is belongs in the capcut that u are editing, the video you are usually editing will also got deleted in capcut and nothing cannot recover : ( Pls if there is some way u can fix that So that we cannot repeat again our edits or projects that made"

There is a glitch when I'm using the ""draw"" option and I upload it on cloud. And all my draws disappeared. It also happens when I update my project. They all were gone and I need to redraw them. It makes me so raged and heartbreaking. There is also a glitch where I aren't be able to edit my project, it says ""Some footages in project are corrupted"""

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I dont give this app enough credit. Its lacking most features that my PC could do, but thats besides the point. Super Easy to Use interface A WITH GREAT rendering process. WaterMark isnt forcefully place into the video so thats great. Only way you could tell that someone used capcut is from the preset transitions but compared to other videos I made i would say i would have used my PC. Keep up the great work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. I use this for editing videos but there is a annoying bug that has been happening and im sure that other people also get this so please fix it. Okay so the bug is when i click effects it says ""No internet connection"" even though i have a wifi connection. This really limits accessible things that you can do in this app i can't even load anything its getting very annoying please fix this or im gonna dibs out i don't really wanna do that since I've been using this app for 1-2 years."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is too much good but the problem that I face almost everytime is that when I change the videos speed or put effects in that the preview in editor got laggy and not smooth and because of this I cannot edit properly but the result is fine. Also the audios that are safe in my device don't show up in audios section. Please fix this issue because it is getting irritating
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a very good free video editing software there are so many cool tools we can use for editing and there are free templates too. But there is just one problem I can't export any video with 4k resolution while others can even I have updated it to the newest version. I tried every possible thing to make my video quality 4k but It doesn't work. So I will like to request the team to enable the feature for all of us who are suffering.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,overall the app is good only pain I experienced in it is I can't backup or transfer my projects to other devices if you please add this option in next update then I wont delete it
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi!, I love capcut, i have problem in this app, i relate why other comments saying ""Please fix this"", but when I'm editing sometimes it's fine. But, one day this happens. I just added a roblox video and doing a ""Text Speech Stories"", the video freezed even i didn't freeze it. I still recommend this app to you even there's a problem sometimes. I rate it 4 stars. Thank you for making this app, it helps me editing my projects so much!üòä"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app, but needs more features like watch ad to remove water marks, otherwise I would have rated 5stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is garbage. I have tried making something 10 times now. Once I'm adding my videos I hit next the screen turns black and I loose everything.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hello, it was really fun and entertaining to edit my videos through this app. The thing is, I always watch the edit before I'm going to add a clip, which is why it's kind of frustrating to me when I reach the end because it goes back to the beginning. Sometimes it pisses me off. The videos I'm editing are kind of long, so I will slide again and again until I reach the end. I hope you will do something about it. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"its a great app and it has a lot of potential. but everytime i try editing it lags a lot and when i put effects/audio it really messes the whole video up and its not timing well, ive tried deleting as much data as possible but the problem still persists. im on an android and despite it being a few years old it runs other apps well"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is one of my favorite video-editing apps. I have it on two of my devices: a phone and a tablet. However, I'm concerned about the number of text animation effects: there are more on the version for my tablet than there are on the one for my phone. Are there any plans for more animations for texts for the phone version? I'd appreciate it. Thank you"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been twitching lately, I can't edit, the screen freezes, the song doesn't sit, it's messed up, apart from that, it's a legend, but when you can't edit, it doesn't make sense to be a legend. Editing is almost my favorite activity. I make 20 edits almost every day and I like it very much, but I get very angry when I can't, see what happens and fix it please !!!! :("
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love this app it helps me alot w all my edits but there is one problem which is that whenever I'm in the middle of an edit it randomly logs me out and this does not happen with other apps on my phone so It's something that needs to be fixed. Also the app glitches alot sometimes when I check on my projects that I already saved and then I can't find it anymore for example I saved a edit yesterday and now I can't find it anymore. I really hope you fix this.sk.komol. official
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This editing app is awesome, but there's an issue with the audio, for me it feels like the audio is not in sync with the video, this happens to me when I edit very long videos but for short ones everything is fine, also it's kinda hard to put an overlay in a specific place cuz of those annoying attracting lines. Hope you fix it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Just brilliant all around! The most well built video editing app by a great distance.. it's a whole new universe üíñ Wish we could export only audio on Android since this is far better audio editor than most (for simple edits) ‚ò∫Ô∏è * September 2023 update: Please fix the full screen on the editor window! It's super important for me üôå When we are editing 16/9 videos when we press the full screen button it doesn't go full screen on Android. A friend using the apple version works great.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's always really buggy, i don't have the option to set it to 2k/4k either. everytime i put in a video and change the size, the original size stays in the background and it's really annoying. the quality is always terrible and if i add more than 2 effects it gets really laggy and unusable. you need to fix this and not just prioritise the quality of the newer and more expensive phones."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is great and all but it needs some serious fixing. When I try to add some music from my phone to the video I only find some music and the rest I don't find and the stuff that I want to add is always not there and I end up have to somehow have that music in a video to export it which takes a lot of space and time and I am seriously losing my patience. If this is not fixed I am gonna end up uninstalling this app and using Kinemaster instead
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a amazing editing app and there are so many filters and effects you can add and you can add videos sounds pictures and way more! However, most of the effects and filters are mostly the same thing making it hard to edit, and when I bought capcut, I didn't have any idea on what to do, I think a tutorial would be necessary, but over all it is a good editing app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good but are yall ever going to fix the lag??? I'm sure you've gotten a whole lot of complaints about it. It's so bad like I can't edit at all. I try to replay the edit to over look it but it freezes so long and bad that it freezes and the song is still continuing while I'm frozen. I would have given the app a 5 star if the lag didn't exist.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is perfect fir editing but whenever I want to use any templates to edit video clips, it will much time, I waited for 1hr for the video to load the effect and preview the edit but it didn't. Loading the effect of video clips always take too much time to load. I tried it several times to see if it works but to no avail. I wonder why the CapCut is always take time to load the effect from the templates to preview it. Doesn't it happen before? I hope I am not rude about this review."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi! Devs, i really love the app, it is beginner friendly, has lots of useful features, and the UI is pretty neat, but i suggest it could be made better by having a ""Motion blur"" option between keyframes and a ""Mirror Border"" effect that we can apply in clips so it would be possible to make custom transitions, Overall the app is really great and ill be continuing to use it since its the most feature packed video editor out there, Waiting till the next update!! üíúüíú"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app! Better than Any other video editor. It has loads of easy functions to make your videos better texts templates and everything that could possibly be useful. I've never had a problem with it and I would strongly recommend it. The only issue us the music sometimes gives you copyright claimes but you can import other music.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I found the app good until I ran into a serious issue. It'd freeze and close by itself. I had done almost all my video editing and I lost everything because I could not even export it. I almost missed the ddl to post my video. I went to the internet and saw lots of people complaining about the same issue. Everything I tried didn't work so I just uninstalled it and reinstalled again just to run into the same issue ü§Ø So 2 stars to see if someone solves this bugs cause I went nuts this day.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was great at first made some really short vids because it makes some really cool transitions, but, what I was like half way making a vid everything was fine until I wanted to add another song to continue the vid. Like, I restarted my phone, checked the wifi, deleted the app and downloaded it again and it still didnt let me add another song. Even worse, none of my downloaded songs worked anymore. I tried downloaded songs and they didnt work. I tried recording the songs and it wouldn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this very much it is good for making edits! But why 4 stars well it IS a bit PICKY about music it wants to be be downloaded first! I can't even have any music unless I upload it from kinemaster and that's really ANNOYING. I wish that would change but if you recommend unstalling it then installing it (I tried it already), it doesn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"CapCut worked amazing for me up until now. I installed it again to do some tiktok editing and quickly realized that if I left the current slide I was making and went to another tab (Google) the slide would turn all black and I wouldn't be able to do anything except click on my overlays. Very disappointed, only way to fix it is the uninstall CapCut, do all the work all over again and make sure not to close CapCut or switch tabs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's good the old one but this new one is not good you canot export video with no paymentüëç

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is my favourite edit app. I have no problems with this app but expect one. When i try to copy any video clip from my edits it glitches and show's a green line in the right side. I keep deleting it but it won't fix.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give this 5 star when the issue with moving clips on the overlay timeline is fixed. üòä Hi. There's a serious issue/bug I want to report. Moving videos around on the overlay track doesn't work properly. When I move a clip, it doesn't land exactly where I want it to. It lands somewhere else and only reflects the true location when the clip is highlighted and this makes it VERY DIFFICULT to work with many overlay clips/tracks. Please see attached clip for more clarification"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many bugs. The ad cannot be closed because my notch is blocking the way (oppo a76). Why do i have to connect to the internet when adding an effect to the sound? Remove that i think its unnecessary pre install it in the app. The interface is bad why do i have to scroll so many times below it will soon dislocate my thumb. Not very good experience with this app especially when i am offline. Add a feature that installs the effects or pre install the basic ones or something. Thank you
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, i do lots of edits and all flows smooth.. But the problem here is that you dont have the 4k resolution so whenever i send it to some application, it's KINDA pixelated.. Also when i exit the this app, then go back to my work, the filters,text, or stickers does move (displaced).. That's my only problem but overall it is good. Just please fix this minor issue thanks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is actually good, the only complaint i have is it's user interface. It's kinda difficult to put your element/object accurately in different cuts, that's why I've only been using canva for that sort of issue. Canva helps me to consistently put an object at a specific position in different cuts, my only hope is that, capcut must apply that sort of feature as well. It will surely boost overall productivity/smoother videos for it's users. For now, that's my only request for this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"for a while this has been one of my favorite editing apps. easy to use, free, and simple. now I struggle to do basic functions in the app. it glitches frequently, and what was originally free is no longer. it's upsetting it's no longer free, as that was something I truly enjoyed being a broke teen. now I have to find a new app, which is a struggle in itself due to everything being on apple and not on android. enjoyed this app while I could, at least"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and I use it for everything lol but I just wish that the rotation features could be fixed. They're a bit janky and sometimes the thing I'm rotating starts moving(?). But overall this is a really good app! It has things like stock videos, effects, stickers,transitions, filters, etc. I highly recommend it :)"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For now I am just giving it 3 stars. Why? Cause when I wanted to export it cause I want to upload it to YouTube. Well it said it didn't work and I waited and tried more times and it still didn't work exporting it. Now I am uninstalling it and installing it again cause that's what people do to fix this bug. But if it doesn't work im gonna be pretty upset. But pleaseee fix this bug. But Everytime it reaches 100% it says ""Something went wrong please try again later"""
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for years to edit videos and I can say it is a good app. Some problems are when I have lots of screenshots, like 326, I'll press add then it'll teleport me back to were all my videos are and not put all the screenshots in. I haven't tried any other apps yet because the reviews have been bad lately. I don't know if it's my phone or CapCut being CapCut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"To be frank this app is really very annoying, I don't know if it's only on my phone that it's happening, cause sometimes when I try to do some certain videos seen on TikTok with this capcut, it doesn't work, and when it seems like it have worked, exporting it to TikTok will become a very big problem. I've updated it many times thinking it's because it hasn't been updated that's why it's been having issues, but still yet after updating it, it keeps on doing what it's been doing at I point"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app, all of my edits are done with Capcut, but there was a certain text animation, I think it was called the 'Wobbly Project'. Now that I look for it, I can't seem to find it in the in or out text animation, just the loop. I don't know if they have removed it or not but it is quite irritating."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing, as in the amount of access you get and the software you can use for free is amazing, the only reason I'm dropping the rating is because I've been non stop editing for YouTube, tiktok, Facebook, EVERYTHING so I have multiple projects open at once, and while on a daily basis for my content I need it to be consistent. But the amount of times my videos have just completely disappeared and HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK HAVE BEEN DELETED. I can't forgive capcut, it's great, just unreliable"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what's the problem with this app. Everytime I want to edit my videos the app doesn't work. At first I thought my phone was the problem but after I restart my phone it's still the same. The app doesn't work and it cannot use. I have to reinstall back the app if I want to edit my videos. Please fix it soon as possible. Thank you
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been helpful in creating some of my slideshow and very creative with its effects, it's also playful when fiddling around with it. It's genius. I recommend it to friends and families, and also to others who wish to do slideshows, it's user friendly and does not cost much. Thank you capcut for this tool. I hope you'll update more into capcut, I believe this tool could do more‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëè"

Tap to try again"". I tap. It doesn't load. I restart the app. It doesn't load. I restart my phone. It doesn't load. I clear 10gb+ off my phone. Still doesn't load. I eventually decide to uninstall and reinstall the app. I have now lost 3+ hours of unfinished work and the app still doesn't work. Thank you for waisting my time."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was good actually amazing but I logged in one day and all my stuff turned into pro that I use normally for my vides and now I have use the bad effects , this is kind of stupid and that they shouldn't change the stuff into pro and keep it originally to no pro ..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I deleted it a few days back but before I did I saved to the cloud and guess what I re downloaded and logged in to see nothing in the space
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is an amazing video editor app. I say this because i has gained 66k + followers as we speak from editing videos using it. It easy to use & it's beginner friendly, any one can use it. I hope that it's stay for free. I also love the new photo editor section but I hope they fix some of the font. And I will like to Capcut to make a website where we can download their font, cz they are great. I highly recommend anyone to use this app‚ù§Ô∏èüìà."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I lovee this app ! I love it how it has no watermark and it allows you to have its own thumbnail ! But it kinda bug me when i tried to edit a very short clip , It always goes to the transition again and again and it's starting to annoy me a little bit ! Perhaps you could do something about this ?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is easy to use and very user-friendly
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very great app for video editing. It has too many functions
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very convenient and useful apps.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app, easy to use not to mention its free! Great for people that asipire to be youtubers and photogrophers. It does glitch sometimes and the longer the video the longer it takes for you to be able to send it. Which I hate as an impatient person. There are adds but not many. Awesome for tik tik pov's too! Overall a 4 or 4.5 app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,this is disappointing i edited a video i can even export it this app sucks how are we supposed to post our own videos now after this boring update
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This apps is so good, good for your editing video i love this app because this is so good then ang ga ganda ng mga naeedit ko dito promise ang ganda talaga niyang apps kaya kung ako sayo i download mo na rin tong apps nato go go go"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Loved capcut it was easy but after they added the pro it became very difficult to use, I couldn't put photos in without glitch so I had to put all the photos I wanted as an overlay with making the main one photo that was made to be black. Also the text glitched out and would add a bunch on words. Also when I played the edits it wouldn't work the audio would glitch out and be really fast therefore no longer lining up with the video. Used to be easy and fun after the pro I couldn't use it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is great, but please add an option to make your videos with an extremely low frame rate (like 15)! It's a weird request, but I've been looking for something like this in a free app for awhile and I could never find it. Also, please don't change how free this is! This is like the only GOOD and free editing app you can use with androids. Thank you so much for making this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good for editing but it doesn't save your clips in the actual app. I deleted some stuff from my camera role because I would make sense for the clips to be downloaded or something in the app but they're not so now I lost some stuff that I can never get back. What the hell üò°. I still use it often but lately it has been lagging extremely bad whenever I try to do anything with audio clips. Please fix it it is so annoying.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have edited a draft video for school purposes and I just let it be for a while and a few weeks later I opened the capcut app again to finish it but then the text animations that I put into were not working. I tried to delete the text, typed it and add the text animation again but IT WASNT WORKING, idk why it's like this and now I have to redo everything."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its a really great app! i really recommend this app for editor users and more‚ù§ it has a many features in a one app without switching or using other any video editing apps and many social users aroundüòç no need to worry about quality because it has a hd and low without payment (But when exporting it doesn't support my phone on ""Split screen"" MODE because it takes a little short moment exporting so im using it,Last update it supported now but it says its not ""Officially"" supported (its ok üòö)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good tbh..I love using this apps for lyrics but please fix some bugs that's been going on in this app. For example, I do video lyrics and after I finished doing so, I replay the video only to see that the lyrics somehow misplaced from the song like..r u kidding me? It's so frustrated üôÑüôÑ the lyrics was late than the song and I redoing it so many times like I hate this bugs so muchhhh FIXXXX ITTTT"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really useful. Lots of filters and effects, also animation and translations. Best app to edit videos. But sometimes it works really horrible. My phone is an updated Android device and it's not a problem of my phone. Capcut will go back to home screen again and again and many feathers won't get downloaded saying my network is not connected even if it has 4GB internet. Please make it a little faster and also fix the home screen thing, thanks. I gave five stars bcoz I really like this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its very good but it often lags and glitches sounds I listen to the sound on my phone and its fine. Although onceI put it on capcut for a certain amount of times it suddenly has glitches and pauses in the sound. I sometimes have problems with the effects as well it is a great app just way way to many bugs and errors that I would love to see fixed in the near future. I will give this a 5 star rating to get this noticed and run by.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, a little bit complicated but it really helped me with my edits. Way better than other editing apps on mobile. The problem is, though, whenever I use the reverse button which I tend to during edits, it glitches EVERY SINGLE TIME. I hate that. Go fix it ya'll. ü§ßüíÖ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing! A lot of editing tools and really easy to use! Lots of stickers that make my shorts better! But since the new update came, the texting tool broke, I have submitted a report about the problem but haven't received any email or any update about it. I hope this issue gets solved as soon as possible!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All in all its a really good editing app. Its pretty easy to use and has amazing features but i have a few reasons to dislike it. One, im not to sure if its the device im using but everytime i add a lot of clips it freezes. Two, there is no way to recover lost projects. I think we should atleast be able to make accounts to login and a recover button that stores delted projects for 30 days until they are permanetly deleted"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much its super fun to use and also super easy. I love how there is always and option to adjust the effect or whatever is being used. Totally recommend to anybody looking to try editing. There is even an option to change fonts in multiple differant languages like russian and urdu. My only problem is that sometimes it'll lag and that gets annoying especially when it happens really often
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great editing app and it has improved a lot but there's just a problem with the slowmo. Like when I adjust the speed and select the ""Better Quality"", after it processes, the clip glitches and idk why it does that. I'll still keep using this app but I hope you can fix this bug, thank you!! :))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a great and easy app to use for video creation whether it's for tiktoks or other platforms. Even as a free user myself, theres no ads and theres a whole lot of things you can do and you're never really restricted. The only problem I've had with it was theres a few unmarked pro only effects like ""Glitch"" in the text effects. But most likely a glitch (ironic lmao)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,fix the bug. i lost my edit progression because of it. 0 stars. too much things to pay even simple shakes i don't like this app at all please fix it

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this app is easy to manipulate but right now its hard for me to use it because whenever i will add another video the screen will only appear black and i can't see the video that i will be going to edit. this keeps on repeating and its such a waste of time because i keep on exiting the app to be able to see the video that im editing. i hope you can fix this soon.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app for beginners! It's pretty simpler to use and the best part is theres no watermark - I love how everything is completely free and has just as adequate effects, stickers, etc as any other apps that require you to pay! Definitely recommend it. Also one thing I would LOVE to have is a gentle pan/ swaying effect, it would be great if they could add that!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love It!! It's an fantastic app to use for simple and complicated edits. I don't use it very much because I don't edit stuff very often but when I do I have no issues what so ever. Plus the fact that there is so much to do! Most everything is incredibly simple to use. This is great for beginners that are wanting to be a popular content creator. The only issue is the audio is a little annoying to use buy it is an overall great app to use!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good for editing! And its very simple, 10/10"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is great for editing and all of its systems works great. But everytime I import a video it compresses it making any movement in the video look choppy and overall bad. If there's a way to stop video compression please let me know and if not please just remove video compression entirely.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, out of every editing app I try, I have always come back to this one, its basic, easy to use, and one of my favorite apps to use, only thing I would change, is put more modern music in it, using tiktok audio is nice, but I wanna be able to use everyday songs In my edits inside of searching tiktok, other than that, I highly recommend"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,An excellent vedio editing app for mobile. I would just want 2 things in it that would make this editing app a 10/10. 1. 3d Text Animation It would be pretty cool to have a 3d animation for your text as it is useful for people trying to make an ident. 2. Green Screening (Automated) It would make life so much easier if there was an automated green screen. The remove background is a feature but it would be cool if it could focused not on human bodies all the time.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app even tho I just download this. But there is a problem. When I try to edit the music or sound, it playback the front one.

When I try putting text on my edits such as: EMOJICAT edits,Roblox edits, etc the text goes so slow that I accidentally delete the whole sentence! Please try and fix that! Although this is the best app I used for editing! The stickers,the ability to draw ! But maybe add some more stuff! Like being able to add another screenshot or vid into a project you already made! Overall..this is the best app I used so far"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app was doing great for several months, but all of a sudden it is not working as it should. the images are not what I put in and it will keep on showing the same image on the screen even after it has transitioned to the next image. this is very frustrating as it is very inconsistent with what it will and will not do update: if I click on the crop button, it shows the correct image that should be there. however, if I play the video then it shows the image that came two images before it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I still have some difficulties. First : i can't rename the extracted sound effect. Because of this, I'm having a hard time finding the sfx that i need since I have a lot of extracted sfx. Second : When I was about to edit a clip, it keeps previewing until the next clip. This really annoys me because I only need to edit the current clip. Lastly : i can't apply the same subtitles styles to all subtitles automatically and I have to do it manually which takes time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcuts a pretty solid editing app BUT many features require internet access like filters, effects and audio effects too, EVEN after you download the effects you still need internet to use them. Offline editing is not really worth it. I know they are connected to TikTok so that's probably why. But still a solid editing app none the less."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My favourite app to edit and it's the best, super helpful and very easy to use, but recently it updates and I can't open it at ALL, on my phone and when I open it on my computer it closes after like 5 minutes and it repeats it. Very frustrating as I edit a lot and can't do that and I really don't wanna change editing programs as this one is the best so far"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible. I put a vid in the cloud and now I can't edit the video.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'll give this 4 star cause no Shake Effect like alight motion that uses in edits ( I hate that app)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like capcut when I need to edit my video and photos it's because it is so smooth, that's all thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but there was a new bug that I found where wether I speed up the video or keep it at the normal speed, it pauses it no matter what I do. Even when I upload the video it does not stay the same. Not the whole app itself, but like the video that I'm editing. Every video I make doesn't have a pause in it, so this bug is really annoying. Please fix this bug!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a nice app overall and it's good for making edits or whatever but the only problem is that it's laggy and freezes too much. I don't know if it's because of my phone type or what but it makes semi pissed when I make a video with edits and it freezes midvideo or something along the lines of that and whenever you're making a longer video the stuff starts lagging and freezing and after looking over it it just looks dumb afterwards so....I'm only going to give this 3 stars.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, but lags out a lot for an app that requires me to download so much MB for the app, effects, or videos. The lag also affects the videos, occasionally. It has a fair amount of ads, but why can't I watch ads to unlock effects? Most people who use this app don't have the money for Capcut Pro. It's an okay app for people who can't afford AE or don't want to take up tons of storage space with KineMaster or Alight Motion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It takes to long to load and always crops out half the photo their where some points when I didn't have a problem but now it just lags a lot! It won't let you use specific photos and won't even show them in you camera roll theirs only one thing that gets on my nerves the most tho it's that when ever you pick out the photos it takes forever to load at least 15 minutes and if you click off while loading it resets everything!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like this app but I don't like how little there is when it comes to not having premium.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good thing is that it is absolutely free and their are also free templates also it is very easy to use and there are a lot of fun effect and stickers
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every update this app gets worse..I don't think an update should just be adding more features, it's also improving the functionality of the app itself and after the recent updates some stuff have been severely degraded. For eg: the supposed 'smooth' slow motion is not even smooth anymore. I mean, it was actually pretty good before the last 2 or 3 updates and now when I put smt in slow motion nothing changes and it looks botchy. It's so frustrating, pls fix this urgently"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"great apps ! i enjoyed using this for editing video for about a year. but please fix something,.. sometimes if you wanna drag the picture, it'll be lagging and crashing so u need more patience to edit :) . it such a shame- coz i really enjoy using this, but because of that crash and lag whenever im dragging, it'll make me stress out. please fix this oneeee (‡≤•_‡≤•)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall this app is really good especially the 'add beat' function which is so helpful for my editing there are things that need to be fix like the lagging when I play the video/project and the video position the video should stay where i want it to be not at the beginning of the song. I would give you 5 stars if you fix these.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is pretty good I rated it a 4 because it says all aged but when your low to 13+ it says sorry this is for 13+ not for kids :3 like bro the rating says everyone can play this how come this is for 13+ well idk... I'm not acting like a Karen about this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is perfect for tiktok or YouTube because it's free and almost doesn't have ads
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So far the app is great and all. Although, still having same issues with the audio. As for the effects, I noticed most were removed which its makes it harder, since some were what I usually use. I do hope some off the features can be put back. I can't find any app that's easy to use like this one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not all of us are like able to purchase things- and not all of us have Facebook or tiktok- I don't see why you have to be a certain age to be able to edit. I was in the middle of editing and then apparently I couldn't export it because I was using the effects that were now replaced into ""pro"" like seriously-? Edit: Now my video has been freezing at specific times; I've checked if I needed to update, I've uninstalled, reinstalled. Yet its perfectly fine on my ipad. If you could fix it thanks-?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app! I use this app for SOO many things It's also great because there is no ads!! The thing I like most about this app is it has everything I need to edit. For example I want to move the overlay so I use the keyframe so that my overlay can go left and right! It's like an animation type of thing the keyframe can show you moving the overlay next is there are so many video effects you can chose from! I love this app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great for a free editing software but recently I've found a problem. Even though I didn't delete anything multiple of the images I had uploaded were.gone and replaced with the (We could not find this image) screen. Also I don't really like how the snapping works and I would like the option to turn it off but pickers can't be choosers
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nearly everything in the app is nice to use, but the way it handles text is just... why?? it snaps the text away from the one spot im trying to drag it to, when i edit already existing text, the contents just get all messed up, and when i add an image it messes with where the text is on the timeline. i don't see why it hates people editing lyric videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app I just think the exporting could be faster and you should add some more effects plus I can't figure out how to add sounds that I find on the internet and put it on my video but other than that I think it's super easy to use (So many screen shots taken...) I think its about time to update this, Ive changed my rating from 4 starts to 2 stars because my capcut wont work, I'll go on and itll work like normal then the next day I cant edit anything, its really stupid pls fix this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You're doomed fix the problems or the bugs in the app, it's a good editing app, however, my files are getting corrupted because of it, like in my video, it has 33 seconds at first but it became 29 seconds, when I tried to edit the vid so why?? Please Fix it I need to edit my project..... You're really doomed, my edit keeps lagging even though it is not when I edit the videos at first.... I take back what I said earlier, it is a bad app app, for editing don't download it...."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to have this game i long time ago and I downloaded this app again and when I went to the camera the and I pressed the effects I did not see the other effects now because when a long time ago when I had played capcut I always knew the camera thing and there was more effects and now the other effects are gone I really want an update for capcut which is to bring the other effects back so I can use it again and also my sister so thats why I only rate capcut two stars
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good and exciting app! As of learner, it really helps me a lot by editing my performance tasks video. And I hope you guys likes it too, it quite nice. But, i annoyed to the ads of it. So sorry if i would skip it, i just needed it quickly. Don't worry, i still like this. This is really quite nice, and it helps me alot! Keep adding some effects on it"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The apps is great, but there are only 2 things made me really unsatisfied. First, when I put more than 3 overlayss in a row, it suddenly crush and turn into dark screen. Second, I have a good internet but it said you has no internet connection to access the sound effect but others like sticker and effects are fine. I hope developer fix these"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved using capcut and it worked for a while and then one day, it just randomly stopped working. Whenever I tried to add in an effect, it just said ""no internet connection"" even when I was on the internet right next to my router. I really liked using the app, but this issue has been happening for the past month. I hope you can find a way to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is overall amazing. There's slight problems though. One of them being delayed timing. This has only happened once or twice but it's annoying when it does. I'm a Harry Potter TikTok editer. And I make hp edits for TikTok. It's annoying when the video is not on time or even glitchy. My music sometimes doesn't come on to the content on the right time and I have to restart again
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,In my opinion it's a great app and it's fast and easy to learn and to navigate throught it. My only complaint is that I can not sign in to my account. I have tried to delete and reinstall it and and made sure that it was updated to the newest version. I have even looked up videos and tutorials to try and resolve the problem but they were no help. If anyone has any suggestions on how I could resolve my problem I would be glad to hear them.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love Capcut! My #1 app when I'm editing on my phone! Best video editing app üëå
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok I love this app but I noticed how whenever I write something on my video, The video starts glitching when I play it, Also, When I try a template, The video starts glitching too. When I edit a video myself, It's normal, Like I add my own clips to make normal videos, it's fine but if I use a template, the video starts glitching which is annoying me, Please fix this!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really great editing app. This is the second time I've downloaded a editing app and this one blows the other app out of the water. I've been editing clips from my twitch stream and having alot of fun creating these edits! I'm still new to editing and this app but it's been really user friendly and gives me a ton of space to grow. I feel like experienced editors can really get alot out if this app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Be cautious because they keep downgrading the app!!!! This app started off amazing but over the course of time they keep upgrading the app and taking away features!!! Many fonts that I was able to use before have been removed, editing tools removed, and more. They even made it harder to highlight text on the android. Idk if they do this so you can buy the pro version but it's ridiculous to take away festures that you were once able to use with no issue."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,THE BEST free video editing app. Its way better than Filmora GO and it has no watermark and no annoying ending that you cant get rid of. It has a wide variety of tools and resources. I never had any annoying ad experiences and I use it to edit everything for YT. It does bug from time to time but its nothing you cant shrug off. 10/10 app
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Most useful app for video editing.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used a ton of different video editing tools and apps for content creation and ended up deleting them all and unsubbing in favor of Capcut and now it, along with Canva, have become my go to cross platform apps for video editing, creating animations, ads, etc. Totally worth the monthly subscription if you're a content creator of any background. Capcut being open source also makes it an awesome tool for sharing your inspiration."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is turning worse and worse. The first problem is it keeps changing my clips from the audio clip to my video clips and it's swapping it and I have to delete everything just for me to get. Mind you i am using capcut on my chromebook in the website. Another problem is the audio keeps from 0dB to -‚àûdB. There is no settings apparently, and the lag is unbearable. I just do not recommend this app mostly the app online the website for capcut. Very dissatisfied horrible experience.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would rate it higher but there are some major flaws that this app makes. Everytime I don't update the app I always lag and always crashes the app. Everytime I only make a long sentence the app always makes it glitch every time. Sometimes I try to find images from Google to edit but when I come back it says ""Corrupted blah blah blah"" These things are starting to piss me off. Fix it please"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using this app to edit my clips and videos for tiktok or any other social media! Although you need a lot of space and I have to uninstall and reinstall certain apps just to get my editing software. üòÖ On the other hand, I recommend this to many people who want an editing software. And To the people who want videostar but don't have an iPhone or can't pay for the in-app purchases, I recommend using this instead! Capcut is completely free and you can use everything without paying!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a really good editing software. It works perfectly on my computer and my mobile. Zero lags. Really good features, and easy to use. I don't know why people say that it has bugs. The thing is that your device has a bug, not the software. Final conclusion, capcut is really good and it's upgrading day by day."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love capcut. Such a good editing app. I do wish they could fix the bugs on the cropping. I don't know what I'm cropping because it shows me the intro of the video I'm using. It also doesn't allow me to zoom in or out when I use the set cropping for things like Instagram or what not. Please update this and thank you for the wonderful app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Capcut is my ultimate editing companion. Makes my life easier. Thanks to user-freindly tools
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best free video editors I have used in my life. With many video effects, image effects, text effects, filters, music to choose from. The transitions are magnificent and doesn't force you to use a watermark. You can decide to have their CapCut Outro or do nothing or perhaps create your own outro. 5 Stars. Fully recommend everyone to install this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app. The only problem is this one glitch that messed up one of my shortcuts. It would like ""stutter"" the video but the music would keep playing so when the ""stuttering"" would stop the video would keep playing but by that time the music would be over. That's my only critique, and over all this app is really cool.‚ù§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Capcut why when I move the clip to left it doesn't move by itself like last time? Can u pls put it back to move like last time and also pls do not replace the editing buttons like speed, animation, style, delete etc. pls do not replace those buttons from anywhere else cause it's very hard finding other editing buttons. And yeah I love this app it is good/it is used for editing and more ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Words can't describe how incredible this app is, from the transitions to the overlays and filters is just awesome and the fact you can add multiple and still not experience any sort of lag blows my mind. This is app is a banger. Crazy how most apps that cost will get blown out the park by this by a long shot. Keep up the good work and maybe add a donate option in a future update üòâ. 5 STARS üî•üöÄüíØ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app that I use to make all my videos on! The export amazingly with no audio problems or pixelated video. It would be five star, if it didn't continuesly show me that I can't put effects or animations because I'm not connected to the internet. When I have strong Wifi and bars! That needs to be fixed or something."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My 6 year old son downloaded this (AGE 3 RATING!!) and only because I was sat next to him I heard offensive language on his pad.. I asked him to give me his pad, it was this app! CapCut! I've now uninstalled it from his pad! So whoever has small children, this isn't age appropriate even though it says it is! ü§î"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"To be honest,this is one of the best editing apps out there. I can't find any that can compete with it. But I've been having problems with the text not syncing up with the audio,it always lags whenever I play through the video. I hope this problem can be fixed,whether it may just be a problem with my phone or it is a bug within the app,I would like to know what I can do to solve this issue and provide a better feedback because this really is a good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great, although I do get a few certain flaws. One, whenever I add a video the display backs up to another time plot that messes up the video. Next, when I do it over, my YouTube starter keeps shrinking. And third, it doesn't have a Chroma key, so I had to stick to kinemaster for that. All the while though. Great app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really recommend this if you are still a newbie at editing videos like I was, my cousin also had a very easy time getting used to this, but a problem I have been having is that it takes up storage fast. I don't know if that's normal or not or it's just because of my phone, I only downloaded this a few weeks ago because I had to delete this, I had a few lag because I have too many videos saved, and it's already 815MB. I mean, I understand cause of the new update of template and others but still"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"its worked great for me for as long as ive been using it, except recently. ive been working for most of the day on editing a video about the FIFA womens world cup in 2019 and i was almost finished with it and so i exported it to make sure everything lined up correctly before i finished it. when i checked in my gallery ot said it wasnt able to play the video, i went to check to see if it worked on capcut and was really disappointed to see that all the clips were blank."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but theres one thing that's just not working for me. The new update added a slow motion feauture so I tried it but then when I tried the ""best quality"" option it didnt change anything on the video as like the button is not working. I thought it was a glitch that is only happening to me but some people also experienced it. Please fix this as I am really in need of that feature."

I have a strong connection of wi-fi but then this past few days when I need to use tok videos or photos or at least use font of a text it always says no connection. Please fix it as soon as it can be fix because I really need to use it to edit something thats all. ""Feedback"" is no use. It couldn't send because it says that I dont have wifi connection, im getting pissed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good editing app theres not many bugs , glitches and other bad sort of thing happening.You don't need to pay or sign up on this app. But just 4 stars why you ask? Well sometimes the overlay thingy , if you add like maybe 5 or more it just lags and its hard to work with you have to export then continue which wastes my time, but besides that everything is cool in the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing app it help me so much for almost a year now it's been great so far but Recently, I was having problems trying to get capcut pro for my video to export. Everytime I hit the purchase button to get monthly pro it keep saying error and it keep saying I already got it but I really don't. ""Hopefully the system will work for me later on. Capcut I love your app and I want to know why the system keeps saying error and I can't get pro I need your assistance. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut was well back then, but I have many issues in the present. First,they got rid of the popular transition effects like "" white flash "" and the other video effects aswell. I like how they organized it better, but they got rid of a few decent and regulary used effects/transitions :(. 2nd When I edit a video it gets paused by itself. 3rd when I add pictures to my edits , capcut resizes them or changes when they will be there by itself, and it's really annoying anyway, all and all this good üëç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The remove background feature sometimes doesn't work. It just sits at 0% despite saying ""Removing background"" Edit: adding transitions causes glitches on the audio playing in the background Edit: this is buggy as hell. If you tap and hold videos in order to delete them, nothing happens. You select vids but even after passing the delete button at the bottom, nothing happens"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app very much since I am a ytber working hardly uploading every day but sadly my key frames will not work anymore pls tell me why because every time I try to move stuff with the key frames it moves the box not the image, but other than that I would of rated it 5"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall it is a good app and it makes editing easy, however I would like to address that when I made a video that when I download it, through the gallery app it will not play and I am unsure of why. It could be that the video is 6 minutes long however I would need to do some searching around to find a clear answer. But other than that this is an amazing app and I would recommend it to anyone new or a veteran to editing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its great and useful overall. The insert audio is a bit infuriating though because most of the audio I need doesn't show up in the ""in your device"" tab. It doesn't seem to be able to read my files decently, even tho I added the same files in the same folder for those who did show up in the list"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hey developers your editing features are not working at all it says no internet connection although I'm on full internet connection. Please fix it ASAP I need to edit some videos. Thank you
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Capcut works as advertised but I have found many glitches and bugs in the program. The main reason I decided to uninstall the app is because it gave me some nasty notifications about new things with an android icon slapped on top of it PERSISTENTLY. Also more and more features are being locked by a paywall. Works (somewhat), limited by bugs and paywall, stupid notifications, 2 stars, do not recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for almost 2 years now and it's great. It's the best editing app for me because it has a nice feature. But when I edited my videos for school yesterday, It's not responding. When I clicked the audio button it just starts logging and it automatically restarts the app over and over again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything work smoothly except I can't add music to my videos. I tried the audio files built into the app and the tracks that I had downloaded on my phone to no avail. Also, the timestamp below each title is set 0:00. The other day, I couldn't add any of the songs from the audio library because the app said there was no internet connection when I was connected to the Wifi."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice improvement capcut, i used to edit everdayyy until i stopped, and when i take a look back in your app, i see these improvements how you added more effects, transitions and much more, glad you added templates cause sometimes im lazy to edit, capcut is very easy to use, i reccommend it for beginners cause its not complicated like other editing apps. Even though it's simple, if you use it right, you will get good results."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why on earth are they collecting so much of my personal information, and selling it? Along with collecting my location, phone number, device type, and search history, they also collect email and social media contacts, conversations, stickers I use, photos I send, videos I send, and any content I watch. This is nauseating. The app isn't even that good."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why did you add so many adds into Capcut? Don't you want your app to run properly and people use it more and more? Plz remove adds.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far this is the most awesome app for edits. Its very simple to use you don't really need help to use it. I learn using this app on my own. There's a lot of filter and a lot of movement. There's speed for slow motion or fast forward. This app is so good. But it's bother me a little bit that it have watermark. It's not that I really care. It's do need credit for the awesomeness üòâ.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,So many songs I can't edit. Like unless I sing it you won't edit. Crazy shame.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm a loyal user of CapCut but recently I found the app very frustrating. Everytime I exported my projects to 2K/4K, I always get the error message saying ""your picture/video has been deleted, check your system album"". Before, I never find this problem, since my default files are also 2K/4K quality. So, can you explain why does this happen? Please advise."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its the best editor in the playstore I found so far. But one real question if I make a 15 min video with 500 megabytes and I make it into 5 min why does it cost gigabytes? Should the storage of the cut video go down instead of going higher. (Thats my only problem with the app if you make a video shorter than the original with no special effects expect it the edited video to take up more space than the original.) Thats is what is holding it back from a perfect app. Doesn't make sense for me.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's actually a pretty good editing app! It used to not be very good to be honest but it's deinitely improved and it works really well! I just have one thing though. There's the Text-to-speech feature, but right now it only has english. It would be nice to have text to speech in other languages like French or something. Other than that I really like this app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dear Capcut Developers team. You guys made a wonderful app. You know?? Bangladesh has so many users of capcut. But you did not added bangla(language) font in this app. That's why we has to use secondary software. Please please add the bangla language font.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pls stop asking me to link my email!! So annoying to repeatedly have to say no to this, please stop making the app worse by introducing stuff that is not focused on the user experience but prioritising your desire to get email addresses.App used to be good but you keep introducing things that make the experience worse! I also really dislike the flashing videos on the front page, I miss the simple interface. I also don't like the after I've finished the video you force me onto the templates page"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just downloaded this app. For the past few hours I've been toying with some of the features. It's amazing it's everything anyone could ask for! It's all free to use which is just amazing as well seeing as in my experience to have all these features you'd have to pay for a premium subscription to get most of these options on most other platforms.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, I feel like it's really easy to use. I've been using it for years to edit and it has been amazing. It's free yet it gives you so much to use without paying. The only thing is whenever I use to many things it lags so much, so I have to export it just to watch it fully which can take up a lot of space on my phone. Also all the good video filter and text you have to pay for, which I know is just a way for them to make more money but it's still annoying, but I love CAPCUT."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is too good to be true. I can extract sound from other videos, make edits using the templates they offer, record on the app itself with a tiktok like set up, I can edit my videos play out, and I can use voice over. This editing app is the best ever. My only complain is the loading. Takes about 7 minutes to put all my videos in but that problem isnt for evryone though. I definitely reccomend this app 99.999%"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"AMAZING this app is so good for editing there are tons of tutorials for beginners and its very easy to get the hang of, my favourite part its completely free with no in app purchases. This app is great for editing channels who are looking for somwhere to start. Personally, and many others can agree with me, this is the best editing app out there and especially that its on mobile too. You can learn alot , there are no ads its completely free with no catches and that is why i love capcut!!!!!!!!!."

I love this app, it's been great for me to use for a very long time now. Everything I know about CapCut I've taught myself, but even then it has been very helpful and I love using it. But there are so many downsides ro using it. Sometimes it just straight up doesn't work. The text option often doesn't work and will not go where I want it to or let me select a style. Love the app, please fix it!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm gonna be honest here. This was good at first. Until, lag started happening I can't play videos that are 1 minute long without it lagging and crashing. I always put texts in the edits I make and today I tried putting texts in and it was so laggy, I uploaded it only to see a white box in front of my texts. And make it stop lagging it's annoying asf."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sorry to say it like this. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?! CapCut was AMAZING before the update. This is long. 1. Transitions. Okay, so transitions were amazing before the ""uPdaTe."" The update made the transition lag. Hard to explain but going to try. So when I use the transition it does do it but it puts the exact same picture before the transition for 2 seconds. It's REALLY noticeable. Would recommend to not use any effects at all. It lags. 2. DON'T USE THE MAKEUP. Messes up the WHOLE EDIT. Don't get"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was a good editing app at first. But then it started to glitch and kick me out of the app or my projects. Then I left the app alone for a bit, and when I got back in it, it deleted all of my projects. Hours of hard work down the drain. So I don't really recommend getting this if you have a tiktok or youtube channel. But other than that, it was okay."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was really great and easy to use but while I was editing, the animation for the words suddenly went gone. I reinstalled the app but still, I cant seem to find the in and out animations for the words. I hope you'll fix it right away. Thank u!!!"

Now, my friends usually tells me if they want something for me to edit. It really is a nice app. You don't need to be great at editing to make a great video, all you need is your imagination and patience to make a great video. I love everything about this app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing!! It's what I've been looking for all my life lmao. So many unlimited features!!! Edit: a suggestion; there should be an option in effects to change the transparency/opacity of the effects. For example some bling effects are too strong and there are too many belongs, it even makes the video lag. Maybe add like a bar (like the volume bar) where you can change how strong you want the effect to be?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app deserves a 4/5. I would've rated it 5/5 if they added an option for us to get rid of the grid thing to adjust texts/overlays (which almost every capcut user knows/has seen). I also hope to see the graphs improve since the graphs right now aren't that smooth. Overall, in general the app is simple and easy to use/get used to, and I recommend to use this. Again, I hope the creators/devs fix these common complaints and issues us capcut users have been complaining about for the past months."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I first downloaded this app it seemed to work just fine but after I used it for like 2-3 days it started lagging SO MUCH like I had to delete and download this app several times just so I can edit because whenever I tried to export my edit, (which a usual edit takes 30+ minutes)at some point of the edit it just goes black. And you have to delete and download the app once again AND make another edit. Highly frustrated from a 16 year old that likes editing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like and recommend this app, really easy to use and love the free effects...but still has a problem, not sure if this happens to others but when I insert any audio in my project, export it and share it there is not audio at all...so by all means I‚Äôm kindly asking you to fix this problem. Thank you."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is one of the best apps for editing, but one thing has recently been annoying me since I've started using longer clips. Every time I try import a clip over 720p, it tries to compress it. I had to wait 15 minutes to import a 9 minute 1080p videl today, there needs to be an option to turn off compressing."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good editting app but. Sometimes it gets laggy and so laggy to the point my phone just freezes. And I have to turn it off and on again. And then the video I have edited isn't saved. And when I click on the project it says ""project is not found"". I have spent so much time on that specific edit. I wanna throw a fridge at someone right now. I'm very disappointed please fix this thank you"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is great it functions very well and is easy to use/get used to but the reason why I give this a 4 is because of the pro features update. I'm not a fan of it because the pro features thing was kinda unnecessary or unexpected because u have to pay for better features to edit ur video when before it was just easy to pop a effect in and the pro features idea kinda lost the uniqueness of the app because now it's just like other editing apps where u have to pay for better effects.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the app is good for editing all functions are amazing, The feedback is that, the app could also include an Instagram linking account for templates to create the content."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is a good app for anyone who wants to edit. It's easy to use and the vids are fairly good quality but I do have some issues though. Firstly I've always had a problem when I add too many overlays, the video slows down but now on top of that when I add too many pics/vids or spilt them too many times the app/vid glitches making it near impossible to edit. Another problem that I have is w/ removing the background sometimes it'll distort the main subject and keep some parts of the background."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you adjust the sensitivity of the chroma key. I think it is a high sensitivity because Some objects disappear when the chroma sensitivity is higher than 1% only.. Also, I hope you will add an option in spilt menu (from now..untill now)to make cutting easier.. And while applying effects too ..This will make the editing easier..There is an application called VITA.. It has these features. I hope you will add them to your application"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is kinda meh, it's by far the best *phone vids* editor i can find but it just has soo many bugs and glitches. There's a bug where the first few seconds of your video freeze, sometimes when applying transition effects the clip before that would be blurry, the app sometimes resorts to changing certain effects here and there without your concern in order to handle the video like changing the colour of text and the worst part is that these bugs show up in the end result"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"THIS APP IS SO FRUSTRATING!!!!! Literally when im done making a video, i play it, and then noticed a glitch which i thought i could fix easily, but then i spent 15 to almost 20 minutes trying to remove that glitch, but still couldn't remove it. Then i look up on yt on how to remove it, but then after 10 minutes i still couldn't manage to remove it, and it only just made it worse when i tried to fix it. PLS FIX THE GLITCH!!!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Until now, all the android video editor apps I have used were quite difficult, but capcut is very easy, but it lacks one feature. If that feature is also added in capcut, then it can go to the top from all android video editor apps. That feature is Stock Videos, there should be a search option in capcut, on which stock videos will appear on typing and we can use them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: I'm currently updating my capcut because it has so many issues. First, THE LAG. In my experience, When i create a project then adding a clip and adding a music it immediately gets laggy and i hated it the most. Second, My favorite effects can‚Äôt be seen anymore and it just shows no internet connection even though i have a internet connection. Fix it please. Im begging."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE app, I spent over a hour editing a video simply trying to cutout some people on a 40 second video, and I couldn't even do that because no matter how hard I tried the app would take people not in red and put them in red even though I made sure to make it so they are not in red 10 different times, it repeatedly reverses things you do in the cutout feature so you waste hours and can't get a single thing done DO NOT RECOMMEND"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app so much until I always got this one issue. That issue that I am talking about is the issue of ""Internet Connection Please try again"" everytime I would try to do absolutely anything It won't let me. I always have perfect connection, and it still says that. I've used this app since 2020, and it's now saying this. I'm no longer a capcut editor because of this. Once you fix this issue I will put 5 starts."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just to get this out of the way first- everything about this app is really good. It has great editing features, simple... uh... okay, that's really all this is, editing. But one MAJOR thing made me deduct two stars from this review. The audio unsyncs itself while you're playing the video in-app. Now if you don't know what this means, too bad, go Google it because I can't make this a whole lot longer. This is a very annoying feature. I don't know what's happening. No idea how it does it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing editing app but it has become nearly impossible to edit since the audio seems to lag in comparison to the video. When I'm talking, my voice is delayed by 2seconds compared to my video and it makes it editing inaccurate. I tried it in different phones as I thought my phone was not powerful enough but the problem still persists. This is really annoying especially when I'm paying for the pro version."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Amazing for editing and putting videos together but overall i did not have a good experience. I made a video and edited it and it said to download it i needed to free up space and i deleted photos and videos and i thought the video was saved on the app but i went back to download and it was all erased. 2 hours of hard work deleted. Adding a star because it is good for editing. 2 stars in total.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate the functionality of this app, it works well except in one instance which makes it essentially unusable. With over 5000 clips in my files it's virtually impossible to easily find the clips I want. I have to scroll & scroll & scroll until I happen upon the clip. First, there needs to be a fast scrolling button. Then there needs to be a way to alphabetized the clip/album names or group the clips by date so they can efficiently located."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is the best editing apps ever existed. It's easy to use, easy to learn. Even tho everything is premade but it's all free and the quality it's amazing, capcut is my favourite video editing app. been using this since late 2020 and the update are getting better and better. Thank you so much for this amazing app! I love you~ developer doing a great job! can you fixed the bugs? Sometimes it ruined my time stamps and trim time for the beat of the audio. Overall PERFECT EDITING APP!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good editing app would recommend it's a little hard to figure out at first but you get the hang of it. But now there is a new feature that you can just when your editing in a project add a template on it and there are regular templates that take other editors edits without their consent and it's making it take two seconds to make a edit that someone probably spent 5 hours or longer on be better it is also lags after a few effects are applied to mine but it is still a good app

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It would be a five star but there's just SO many updates and it takes up quite alot of storage with the updates I get you need to get the new edits but it can just be annoying I've probably had to delete 5 or more APPS just to keep this one and you can't even now add an update you can't go onto the app if you don't update it, it is quite a good app though it works well and there are bearly any adds. Overall this app is really good if you have lots of storage."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use this app for everything it's amazing but it's been glitching my videos I checked my storage and nothing was wrong with it. I also tried to save a video I made and it didn't work I waited 10mins! But nothing happened it was stuck at 99% it didn't even need updating. I love this app but it gets irritating after a while please fix this.

I didn't wanted to uninstall it immediately but now it have no usage in my mobile. I hope to have a fix in this app cause I still believe that no video editing app is better than Capcut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So I have this very big problem that I'm experiencing. So I was working on my school project in this app that took like 3-4 hours. And that vid has pictures and stuff I have gathered for minutes. And when I'm done with my project I imported it to my gallery. And when i watch it there were no pictures shown in the vid. It is just GONE. although it's easy to use but please fix this problem. So I can give you 5 stars.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate a glitch, ive been editing with this app for 2 years and this isnt the first time this happend, if i import a sound and add another one, i crop the 2nd audio and put it next to the other audio, it would glitch, how? Like when the white thing would go across the 2nd audio it would dissapear, and when i would put it on a specific clip it goes away and deletes itself or puts it far away from where i put it."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is pretty great but there are a various flaws that really bothers me,like the time when I made a film video for our project,when I was about to save the video it says I can't save it cause I don't have premium access (because that was my first time using it),so I had to redo the editing again,back from the start,thank god I was able to pass it on time.but it was worth it,we got the highest score ‚ú®üëÄ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is really amazing and I love it. Since the new update to where I can make my edits come out 60fps I've been hooked even more. My only request and downside of this app is can u make it where when I add a effect I can slow them down or speed them up like the effect [party] [black flash] and cut the part of the effect I want like for glitch I always wanna cut out the last part so I'll be able to make my videos look better. And I also want more [combos] cuz I use them for my transition.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This SO good editing app. I've tried so many apps but this is the only i got used to easily, literally.

No problem in editing, but there is one problem which is totally anoying that at ""Me""page we can sign in to Tiktok, So I sign in and when I press Authorize button and it loading for a while and just go back to the ""Me"" page and did't sign in.

I mean what kind of app is that? It isn‚Äôt clear yet so fix the problem! And also! I saw there is a bug here, whenever i export a video at the first its way to fast!! Please fix these problems!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app to edit with, because you dont have a water mark. You may ask why i give it 3 stars?

Ive tried fixing it adding different filters then taking them off, but it isnt working. Please fix this."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app in my opinion, is one of the best free editing app on the Play Store. I would love to make some suggestions to this app. First, I think it would be great if templates were added more frequently. For the effects, I think it would be nice to use augmented reality, and to include smoke, fire and chromatic effects. For the stickers, I think it would be awesome if Giphy was included, as there would be more choices for stickers. I also think the addition of more audio effects would be nice."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I frequently use this app for editing. The thing that bothers me the most is that when I try to resize a photo, text, etc., it sometimes rotates. It takes me some time to put it back to 0¬∞ so PLEASE. Have a rotate option. I have been suffering. Other than that, I have no complaints. This motion blur update is really good!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really wanted to edit so bad, at the start of one or two images it is good, the video showing is good, but the white line that is the guide that shows the edits is not smooth!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Only four stars. What I hate in this is that aside from frequent lagging, everytime the Capcut got uninstalled all of the data or saved edits/drafts would be deleted as well despite the account being logged out. Cuz turns out it wasnt saved on the account itself which make it basically useless. Its really annoying. Plus its really needed to be uninstalled from time to time as it keeps lagging. PLEASE FIX THIS."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wish this was available on computer or laptop but it is still a really good app even though it may have a few bugs its really easy to use and very helpful for editing purposes, some advice Cap Cut you should add more animations and transitions even though there are a ton you should add more so people have more options but you don't have to. I really recommend getting this app if you want to edit photos or videos. If this app had no bugs it would have a 4 star and if it was on computer or laptop this would be the best free editing app EVER, so Cap Cut release this on computer PLEASE everyone wants it and you will most likely get more downloads so please add this amazing app on computer it would be too good and I would certainly use this at least 2 3 times a day.

It's very lagging i really wasted my time for this. And i can't export my video because it's still loading. Loading everytime!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this. It's better than the other apps the fact that the watermark isn't in the middle or in the corner is just wow. You have my respect and I hope the DEVS of editing apps SEES THIS as to why this app has more DOWNLOADS than theirs. edit: please put an option to turn off video or picture snaps literally cannot place the pic right without it snapping to a different place thats minus 2 stars for me
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great been using it for over a year now, the only thing is that there should be another login options perhaps an email and a search bar for audios coming from the device since I have too many songs stored, it's a hassle to just scroll down all the time. Still giving a 5 stars for the hardwork and be inspired to consider my suggestions. Edit: Update the new version just now, what's with the lag!?"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app, I've used it for many things, But for the past 40 minutes I picked out photos from my gallery of how 2021 went and when I went to edit it, capcut stopped working I exited the app before waiting a few seconds and reopening it to find the video gone. Please fix this problem. Happy new years!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello, this is probably the best app on Galaxy for editing, but the only problem is, the transitions and animations aren't too good. Maybe could you add more Animations like ones on Videostar? Especially how i don't have an IOS and i really want to use an animation, that is really smooth and not just teleports to the side and comes in. Please could you add more animations? Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much. It's easy to use and pretty self explanatory, and unlike a lot of other video making apps it's completely free! I definitely recommend. But just one thing, when u make a video after a day or so when u go back into the app u can't access it. But if u saved it (witch u probably did) U can access it in photos, Youtube or whatever u saved it on so it's not that big of a deal. Hope this helps!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"New version of this app are not good as the old version was,,, the reason is i thought and as much i have seen some features are not available in new version like vocal isolation etc..... all over the app is too good but the developers should Focus on that point, if you are adding some features so please not delete it in new versions..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very impressive role of capcut in social media and other trending options of every field of life. Introduce to see new way of beautiful part of pictures and movies.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It a good editing app for starters. However I don't recomend it if you're a longtime/""pro"" editor-cause after alot of effects it will turn too laggy and unbeat to watch. Theres still a lot of opitions to edit so its good I guess if you arent doing that big of an edit. Also its super annoyning when it forcefully places texts and overlays on the middle..I wish you could turn it off and if you want on."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I rate only 4 stars. We all need some other options in the soundpicking because theres no files option in it. Another problem is when video picking in some moments it is not refreshing and not showing all new downloaded and recorded videos so you need to add some refresh button or something. Also some other phones include mine, the 60 frames option does not work even I choose it in export option. The frames is still laggy even I chose that option, pls fix that."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"90% of the audio in templates shows as ""removed due to copyright"" makes this app utterly WORTHLESS."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good editing app though. However, I rated it 4/5 stars because there is this bug during the transition from one clip to another. This bug involves the very last part of the first clip being repeated one time after the transition. I found this bug when I edit a Tower of Hell montage. This bug looks really bad on montages. Bytedance, please fix this bug."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"dis app is amazing and I appreciate the fact there's no watermark! however there are 3 things I'd kinda wanna see added: 1) disabling the snap to grid- when I'm trying to move small overlays especially near the middle its impossible too, bc it keeps snapping them to the middle. 2) more overlay rows bc id like to use this app for animating and 3) the ability to adjust the ""strength"" of effects, especially in the bling section bc sometimes the sparkles are too bright lol I rlly like this app tho!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great editing, cloud service makes no sense. The cloud service provided doesn't cross-sync with other devices, meaning there is practically no point in buying it. I did hoping I could download my project on another device because my phone doesn't have enough storage for said project. I was greatly disappointed to find out I instead wasted an hour of my time and $2 on a subscription."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. It's really great but there is just one problem, IT KEEPS CORRUPTING MY PICTURES! So yeah I am making a stop motion thing for my little cousins (cuz why not) and sometimes when I finish a part of it, a picture would disappear or not even do the thing I wanted it to do. And it keeps happening ALL THE TIME NOW! But maybe it's because of my REALLY bad space I have on my phone. But yeah other than that capcut is a good app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but after they released the new update for advanced slowmo settings, I've had issues with clips. What I mean by that Is I'll try to shorten a clip and it doubles the time by 3x. So if I have a clip that is 6 seconds it will turn into either 12 seconds or 30. I've done all I could do to fix this myself, but I cannot."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So whenever I make words or stickers or something I can move it will just stop moving then move but when it moved it moved to far so I couldn't get it is the area I wanted it to. It made it like I would want to put it at the top of the scream in the middle, but it would just stop moving and get teleported to inches away from where I wanted it to be. It would be 5 stars, but that ""bug"" (i don't know if it's a bug) makes it 3."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey, developers. I'm here to thank and gladly say that this app is really impressive and, at the same time, a helpful app as it helped me with my academics. You did a great job, and thumbs up for that. I know that on an unexpected day, this app will have an update and I hope that just in case, you add more effects or something else, like the distort effect on the head, where you can place it wherever you want, like you can move it in a specific direction. In any case, however, this app is awesom"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app I've ever tried, I have been a Capcut user for over 2 years. Effects are so good and the graphs are smooth. Smooth Slowmo and HSL is also great, I'm loving it more! Although there is no oscillate or any other effects similar as Alight Motion, But after all it's so easy to use and can help you improve your editing skills."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a decent app but it has a lot of button that you can mess up your editing with which isn't a big problem if you have been using it for a while and got used to the layout, like me.But the biggest thing that brought the stars down was how it did not work.At All. As soon as I went into my cap cut iand I did a new project,everything was blank and I couldn't play the video, agd stuff, do transitions, or export.So,I had to reinstall and losts all of my drafts,some of which were not saved. Fix it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app as it really can make good edits if you know how to use it HOWEVER, with this recent update of ""Capcut Pro"" has really irked me. Capcut was originally made as an editing app specifically to not charge it's users and spare ads. ""Capcut provides users with a wide range of video editing functions, filters, etc. while keeping it free of charge and ads-free"". As a user who downloaded the app because of it's free functions like many others, I plead for Capcut to stay free"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's easy to edit, make videos etc. But I have a few suggestions to improve the app. I think you should add more of those text to speech voices so you could have more audio. You should also add smooth animation and good quality so that the edits turn out better. I think these will make more people want to use the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like capcut, the efects are easy to use and its a simple app that you can get used to very quickly. But i have one issue that bothers me a lot. Since ive got a new phone my slowmotion is not smoth, on my old phone it worked great. I click ""better quality"" but its the same as the ""faster process"". This has been bothering me for a long time and im really sad that i cant have this feauture on my new phone, and i know its probably just my phone because it works fine on my sisters one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't usually rate or comment on apps, but Capcut is worth it. Despite having a lot of pay blocked stuff, it still has so many options. It lets you work with templates, or choose to make your own things. It doesnt matter what type of editor you are, this is the app for you. And one more thing as a recommendation: please make it possible/more obvious on how to remove snapping to the grid on photos."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good editing app, easy to use and such, good for gacha videos, although there is two minor iss-yous. Whenever I put all my screenshots in it glitches out and the screenshots are never as timed as I want it to be. I understand if you can't but if you can please fix this and I will give it a fivestar ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢¬∞ Also can you add an option to like put audio in slowmo for a certain amount of time, and viceversa? That would be really cool with aesthetic editing audios :D"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut's good, but I hate it when capcut automatically compresses my vid clips w/o my permission, that results to the lowering of the quality of the vid that I imported to capcut. Also, just wanna suggest. Please adjust the motion blur of some transitions, especially the zoom trans, and please give a custom selection of the background colors, and I hope that capcut would add the feature of exporting pics/jpg from capcut, like that feature in alight motion. That's allüòÄ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Well hey I like it but if it lags on u just export it it won't lag after that also there is good editing stuff u can make your own things yea I rate it 5 star but yea pick about you I hope u enjoyed
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app! You can export on any app Quality is amazing you can make really good edits and I suggest people that edit like me should use Capcut at first its tricky but once you use it for a while it becomes easy I did do 5 stars but when I make a edit and go to the next clip I usually put a Shake and I did it was Completely right timing but when I check the video when I export it the timing becomes out of time I can't edit if its like this
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app allows you to do a lot of things. By either 1+ pictures/videos! This is great for editing. Let's say you finished recording a video. You can take out sounds, write text that you can make Text - To - Speech, you can add stickers, you can add a overlay/ another video, you can crop it, you can change the opacity on different thinks like stickers or overlays, you can change how long or short the video is, you can change the size of a sticker or text, you can even change the color of text!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing overall, But one thing that gets on my nerves is when you're trying to move a picture that's really small, it's so difficult to move it and place it in the right position because the app automatically moves it at the center. I can't explain it properly but basically I can only move a picture up, down, left and right. And it's really annoying. Please add an option to turn it off."

Thanks/ 19th June. A month later and still no difference, no reply either from Capcut. Still very laggy, and slow. Downgraded stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy app. I can edit stuff very easy and when it's finish, it downloads very fast too. So why am I giving it 4 stars?

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for editing videos! Specially for youtube and tiktok. Capcut is really easy to use + lots of different effects, you can add your own extracted music/voiceovers, etc. People sometimes say capcut is actually a bit laggy, but it depends on your device. It's completely free too! I have been using capcut for 6+ months now, And not a single laggy edit! (Capcut sometimes dosen't support some screen recorders and I use mobizen so try to find one that works with capcut) Rnjoy yourtime"

But, I can make edits with this app easily and I like it. I give it 4 stars because the frame rate on the app would look very horrible if too much is added in an edit. The only way I check if it's good is by sending it to someone on Instagram."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,most amazing editing app ever. i've had it since 2020 and i don't regret a bit. this app replaces ALL editing softwares trust me. u want good quality/transitions on aftereffects? capcut has it. u want motion blur/velocity from videostar? capcut has it. also completely replaces alight motion (+ u dont HAVE to make ur own transitions w keyframes.. capcut has em all prepared).

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly this app is amazing I love it it's my favorite app to make my edits with but lately it's been crashing like crazy and glitching I can't make more than 5 edits before it starts glitching or crashing. It did this once and I tried reaching out to support and also reporting the problem but I never got a response so I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to be able to do my edits again which meant I had to restart my edits 2 times just to get them to export
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Way laggy. I used it quite often until my phone nearly commit...I use other editing apps with no problem...it's a shame too because I truly do like the app...but it's impossible to use. My wifi is fine and my phone can handle other apps, some larger than CapCut, but it still fails to work. If Capcut hadn't become more of a social media platform it would likely be less laggy."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The camera feature is rather annoying to be honest. The clips I record regularly disappear when I save it as a draft.

Can you fix this?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,When having capcut it's easy but when you're doing your edits is sometimes logs you out of your edits so it gets frustrating but either way it's still a good app like I prefer it to anybody who wants to make their edits cool it's easy for beginners but it starts getting harder because you're getting better at it so it's a little bit harder because you got to do a little bit more editing. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I also really like how you can add many pictures and videos! I totally recommend 100%"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay imma be honest, capcut has gotten ALOT laggier after the update. I cant even get a single edit done bc of it. Before this it was fine, it lagged a little but I can still work on it. But now I can't. The lag made the audio off timing making it harder to know where to put beats and stuff. If you can please fix it bc it is a great app and I still wanna use it."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app overall is very good I rate it a 4 beacuse of a few minor things 1. I think there should be more text effects flaming text etc. 2. I think you should be able to favourite animations to speed up the time it takes to find the specific one you need or a search option to reach the animations faster This is the end of my review Thanks
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It works OK when used on its own. However I have no access to templates and the templates don't appear on videos on tiktok so unable to use templates for some reason. I understand this app won't work properly in some countries but I live in the UK which is meant to be a country that it Does work in. Very frustrating but the links just don't appear on tiktok videos as it does for other users üòîüòî

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have used a lot of video editing apps and I find capcut to be the most user-friendly all while giving professional-looking results. I recently edited a video for a university project and the video looked catchy and so good that the department made my video into the official video for the project with a few changes of course. I love this app and will continue to use it. I don't know if capcut has a premium version but I'll surely buy it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It shouldn't be hard to figure out how to import photos or videos. Isn't that the whole point? Make it more obvious, add an import button everywhere."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a cool app but whenever I try to make videos almost every time it won't finish uploading it also takes up alot of space, I deleted it and now I'm trying to reinstall it, now it won't let me download it please fix this and I will rate it higher, it's really good but like I said takes up to much space and it's also laggy, the good things are is that there are no ads and it's simple to use if it works, but I BEG you please fix this glitch."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i've been use Capcut since 2 years ago, but until it update, i can't. I like the updates in this app, but there are some updates I don't like. among others : 1. update to the ""fade in"" text effect, the effect looks the same as the ""Type 2"" text an update to the ""fade out"" text effect. 2. text opacity. Usually I can change the text opacity to 0%, but for some reason now I can only change it to 7%. forgive me if there is a wrong language or word, I hope I get an answer."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This video editing app is a very good app I must say but lately it's been acting up. If I click on a capcut templates from TikTok and attempt to use it. It's doesn't work anymore. This happened after I updated my capcut. Please you guys work on this I really love the app and I don't want to start using another video editing app for my videos.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has more glitches than Pok√©mon Red and Blue. I tried coming back to a video to edit more, and there was just a whole other random video from my camera roll playing on top of it. I couldn't find a way to fix it, so I was just forced to scrap it. And if you try to cut to a different video, if the original video's dimensions are bigger, you'll just see the last two frames of it playing behind the new one. I could sit here all day listing off glitches, but I'll just say this: FIX YOUR APP."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is a very good app for editing videos and stuff, I use it to edit videos for myself or for school, I like how it has a lot of templates for you to choose from which is really good when your not a very good editor or just lazy to make an edit.

The slidings, the filters, and you can even add as much photos and you can add you very own music, or choose a sound.üëå But I do have one problem, everything I download a music, it won't show so I have to erase it and download it again. Can you please fix it..."

FIX THIS THING. then, it lags in a crazy way, like when there are multiple photos to do an animation. it is impossible to use, FIX IT NOW, or i'll definitely disinstall this app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"FUN! EASY! FREE! I've been looking for an app like this forever, and I finally got it! Free with almost no ads! It has everything you'd ever need to make a music video, edit, sideshow, or even just editing a video of your vacation or whatever! It's super easy to use, and it guides you through everything. I will never delete this app."

Bravo!üëç"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can u add the feature like when you cut the video, other than split pls add the trim to right or left of the playhead, plus when i split the video, why the parts that i cut just not on the point. Everytime i wanna resume the project why the ratio on the screen become different rather than before and its smaller, and it just get worst, when i apply the animation nothing happen, pls fix this, i love this app cause all the transition in this app is all included. Pls respond ,dont ignore us"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's been working just fine for me for 2 years, then all of a sudden i go into it today to edit a video and none of the buttons work. it lets me put the first clip in but it wont let me do anything else; add more clips, overlay, i cant even select the clip already there. ive tried closing the app, deleting the project and making a new one, uninstalling the app completely, but nothing works."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love all the features! The app is really great in terms of editing posibilities. The only thing that is absolutely awful is the export quality of the videos. The exported videos are soooo low quality vs the initial video, they look really bad. Can you make a setting to chose the export quality of the videos?!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is app great, it's easy to use and it has many features, including good royalty free sounds which is a complete pain in the butt to find otherwise. My only problem with this app is why if i rename the video does it not save into my phone with the name i give it. That's really annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be such a good app but the new update sucks. I expected so much better from Capcut bc I've been using it to make edits for over three years. Its what got me started and I used to love it but now it's glitchy, the layout is weird, the format that it automatically goes to when you put pictures into it is crazy small and you can't even put text on it if you want it to fit the frame, and it's just overall gone downhill. I'm hoping it gets better again soon."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good editing app and is intuitively made especially for beginners however there is one MAJOR issue that I'm sure alot of other people have experienced. When you make an edit then delete the pics from your phone and you cant ever see that beautiful edit you made ever again! It just breaks my heart to see it all gone in one simple click. So I request you to add a feature where you can either see the edit without that screen or somehow export the edit and everything is back to normal again.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app but I have an issue with exporting. Sometimes it doesn't work (usually this is fixable by clearing space or staying on the capcut window) but when it stops the export, the amount of storage it had taken up to save whatever progress it made is still there. So I'll have 10gb free in my phone, try to export an 8gb file, the export will fail and I'll have only 6gb left with no cache to clear. Please tell me where I can clear these failed exports."

It has so many amazing features and the fact that they are freeüòß--I am literally so so so thankful that all the awesome features which in other app we had to pay for are free here thank you so muchüòÅ. BUT THERE IS A BUGüòê..after i make the whole video and add an EFFECT it just ruins all the timings of clips, the music timing, some of the clips become full black and Glitches just way too muchüò©. Please fix this then 5 stars for sure..annd Thank youu üòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really helpful for editing and it has no annoying watermark compared to other editing apps. But I have 1 problem, recently when I'm exporting it brings me back to the CapCut homescreen when the exporting will almost reach 20% and can the developers add the option to save the exported video to your sd card in future updates? It's still a great editing app in my opinion :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its amazing but the sound from tiktok keep me sign out, i alr sign in, and if it sign out, it wont let me sign in back, plus u should let new user capcut making templates too, maybe they just late or what. This is getting annoying, the more the update, the more bug/glitch/ delay become. Fix that so people can enjoy without getting bug or something."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing app. One thing that doesn't really consider it as a ""reliable"" editing app if your internet connection is slow. Since recently I have been receiving problems in the app that shows when I save a video, the video is no longer available to play in my video player :)."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first, when I open the app and trying to find templates, it say my connection was unstable then suddenly logged out. I tried to logging in again but always ""Couldn't sign in. Try out later"", also i tried to uninstalled the app but nothing change. Please fix this, Capcut is actually a cool app and I would give 5 when this bug fixed, thank you. Edit: bug fixed, thanks!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear capcut, I used to be proud to say that this was my favorite editing app a long time, but it's getting ridiculous. I had to uninstall it when I had about 400 projects, because I had something wrong with my app whenever I open the project and put in a video or a picture, I couldn't touch it or add overlays. it was rather surprising, because all my about 3 years of using this app, it's never done this, and this were just recently happening, so I'd like to get a reply."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,download it now!!! It's the best mobile editing app and the software is free become a capcut creator!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"April 5, 2024 A decent editor overall, but I'm having a lot of issues with dragging overlay pictures and videos. They don't appear to line up properly when I drag them, and sometimes they will disappear from the timelime but not the actual video. And sometimes the overlay I try to trim shows up as the wrong item. It would be nice if they could fix this. 865 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great for beginners like myself. I'm impressed so far and don't have any complains.

There's a lots of effects, beautiful filters, amazing fonts, animations, stickers, No time limits and best of all no Watermark like other apps. I would rate this app 10,000 stars if I could. It's the best I'm just in love with it. If you're reading this comment what you waiting for? Press the install button to get this amazing app now. It's not overwhelming at all."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the hard work that has been put in making this the best app I have used for video and photo editing so far it's really been impressive, and highly commendable but of recent I've noticed some bug's in this videos to be edited have been kinda slow once u upload the video to the edit interface it goes into slow motion, pls I'll love to have your feedback on this"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really good app! I would recommend this to the people who like good transitions. But the reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I would like the app to allow us to do our own transition. And there is this other problem I've been having a lot lately but it seems to be like when I'm doing my edit the video his fast in the beginning and then slow down to it's original speed. But other than that everything else is great! But in anyway I would like the app to let me do my own transitions.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"CapCut is an exceptional app that deserves a 5/5 rating. The app's user interface is simple and easy to navigate, making it user-friendly for all ages. The app's editing features are top-notch, allowing users to create high-quality videos with ease. The app's music library is extensive, providing a variety of options for users to choose from. One of the standout features of CapCut is its ability to edit videos in a variety of formats, including 1080p and 4K. The app's editing tools are amazing"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Best Video Editor For Mobile Right now thats Available! Been using it for 4 months now and its absolutetly the best Editor. The fact that its free makes it the goto video editor. First I thought people were capping that its a good editor but now that it built up my trust on it I will recommend it to literally everyone! I hope that the developers make it even better overtime, not worse (like some other apps). Thanks you :)"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's nice but making tiktoks without pro is so hard and every single thing good for a edit is on the pro version I wish that they could delete pro version and make everything not pro
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Enjoying it so far because it's quite user-friendly!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best app ever. Everything is really clear but if more features were given it would be better. The exporting system is a problem. It takes so much time and top of that I cannot exit the app so it would be good if you can fix anything bout this. And if there is a option to edit pics it would be the worlds best video and pic editing app. All the time If I edit any pic with this app I have to take a screenshot and then I cut the excess in my gallery but over alll itss the best.üíØüíØüíØüíØ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Is this app free? The best editor I've seen without any other strings attached. Only problem have is that text or stickers can't be moved around freely at times which can get very frustrating when trying to position them properly. Another problem would be when adding a sticker or an image over a video, the first frame of the video is skipped and isn't covered by the sticker or whatever you put over it. It can really ruin some videos. Other than that, perfect 5. thanks"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app and I've used it for 1 year now, other editing apps were really hard to use but when I downloaded this one it was really easy. Although it's laggy when I put atleast 2 effects, it kept getting better until it had pro.... I really wanted to use the cool effects for my edits but I can't because I need to have pro, please take the pro of so we can use better effects for better edits."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I liked capcut before but for some reason very recently after it's newest update capcut and ONLY CAPCUT was being so laggy to the point of after 3-5 seconds of playing a project, it would crash the whole app. It's messed up as well because it also crashes a crazy lot more when I undo, redo, add a overlay or use green screen. It's so ridiculous. I also found out they removed most old affects. Please fix this, my phone hasnt been this buggy with capcut before and I'm not the only one saying this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super impressed with this app. Lots of special effects to choose from (with the ability to tweak them to your liking), many layers to apply them to, adjustable filters, and so much more. My only gripe is the inability to position effects anywhere on the screen, but that's really minor."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Waited through updates, deleting broken app. Subtracting 2 stars. SERIOUSLY BROKEN WITH NO DIRECTORY CONTROL. You cannot choose video save or load directories. Loading vids is a selection of thumbnails (no name) on an scrollable wall... Which would work if you only had 8 videos, but if you have 5000 videos and make VidMemes, this broken interface is frustrating UTTERLY UNUSABLE. As for the videos you can edit, the process is easy and quick, with a CAPCUT logo as a watermark at vid end."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really good, but I give it four stars because a very important thing that they need to add, can you guys please add a future where you can take your own mp3 from your files, and then put it into a video, I hate how you can only extract things, or take things out of the database, or use music that's already in there, like all of those things why don't you add the mp3, please add it, I need it Never mind they just added it, thanks Even though you didn't see it üëç"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use to love CapCut! It was so good to make videos and edits with amd stuff but now i can't use it. Whenever i try to put a picture in and a audio that works but when i trim it it glitches me to the end of it and makes the video 31:30 minutes when it's only 10 seconds. I don't wanna use the app anymore and that makes me sad but i have to. Can you please look into it and try to fix it?
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to think highly of this app until a few days ago when I couldn't Access any of the effects,fonts,animations,graphs and so on without internet access. If this is a bug pls fix it because it is getting on my nerves everytime I need to switch on my data just because I can't have access to something just because of the lack of internet. In the past everything was working perfectly when you downloaded them once and it kept on working perfectly fine. Please fix this or I'll complain again"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had a 15 minute edit and i was trying the voice effects and the video won't play anymore after refreshing it many times now, The app itself gets laggier the more clips and captions you export and animate in, The Subtitles and Music scrolls down after typing/moving it, making it look like it had dissappear, And The Blue Line where it automatically centers the imported clips/pics which everyone has a problem with, 'till this day has no option to disable it. pls optimize ur app better"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terible. Litterly EVERYTHING doesnt work and the only reason people use it is because its the only easy editing app there is. Everything is laggy barely anything works and now theres a ""pro"" option for 8$ a month with not much effects. my phone is not the problem, It has the latest technology and every app works Smoothly, But not Trashcut. The most simple things do not work And its a waste of time."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app very much, I use it for the TikTok platform and even YouTube platform. My only dislike for this app is whenever I go back to review my edit/video, it starts glitching horribly and I'm unable to move at all. I've redownloaded it multiple times and after 20 maybe 30 minutes of editing it starts glitching again and it continues to do so each time I refresh it. Please fix this so called ""bug"" because this app is the only app I really enjoy using and know how to use properly. Thank you"

We tried to understand. Keep it up! Quality than quantity!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's such a shame :( This editor is easy to use and free, but my favorite thing about it was it's coloring settings. It was so different from the other editors, only capcut let me use the ""sharpen"" tool, cause it was so smooth and helped me to reach a really good quality in my videos, BUT the last update messed it up. Now the tools are too aggressive, the ""brightness"" tool doesn't make the image darker, it makes it look too orange, and ""sharpen"" is too rough. Everything looks so weird now..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I will give it 5 star because it is too good at video editting but no good for picture editting i will request to make it more good.

It keeps on crashing, delay with the sound, can't handle multiple effects or animation (it will hang if you put too much effect), lagging.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I sucked at video editing until I came across capcut. It helped me improve a lot and make a bunch of edits I wanted to make. It was also easy to do just took a lot of time and sometimes effort. But it all became worth it as I've made high quality videos. I thank the developers of this app for helping me edit my videos way more easier.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is great fo editing videos, it has tons of features. My only reason for a low rating is because there is an issue when adding long sentences or a paragraph on a video, the text is stacked in a 1 long line and you need to bring down individual words or sentences to make it into 3 lines or more. Please make it automatic in the next update to fit a pragraph in a box ore rectangular form making it 3 lines or more."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It seems like a decent app with some really neat features, but it's so confusing, and they don't seemingly explain the cut function anywhere in the tutorials/faqs when that seemed to be what they were using to draw me into the app. (or how to properly remove most of a video overlay to just the part you want appearing over the rest of it) Wow this app is awful. Try to move an overlay around and either the centering bars throw it off it or stops moving smoothly right around the spot I want it"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is one of the Best Editing App I have come across as a Beginner. I always tend to find some new and creative features every single time I use it.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, convenient. But I want complexity to be optional so you can add more details by spending more time ONLY if you wanted to. Some options are just way too easy and also makes the edit less realistic. 4.5 stars Edit:garbage update. Bro why did you remove so many good things like fade out and opacity on text and overlays??? Now I'm just gonna find another editing app unlike this garbage total waste of time. If only I could rate this 0 stars."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how this app has everything you need when editing a video and on top of that you don't have to pay for anything. During editing you may encounter glitch and lags but it all dissappear once you save the raw file. I give this 5 star because I lobe editing videos and I've been through a lot of apps already and I can say that this is the best app that I've encounter so far. Love it.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best free editing software ever (in my opinion) This is so much better than every other free editors i've tried. Other editors would put a watermark on it which generally makes them useless for me. It provides tons of features and even a library that provide most of your needs. A free and good editor that can replace default editors like Windows Video Editor. They don't charge me anything even though I have like 100 projects and the ads are non-obstructive and I want to support the developers.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Hello there! I have used this app for as long as I can remember and it soooooo nice and easy to use. I have never had a problem with it until now.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoyed use most of the time I make my reels.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best. Simple video editing app. I just needed simple editing, with simple effects (basically start and end effects). You would think that would be easy to look for in an app. I've gone through several apps before finding this one. Great job, developers!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I've been using this app for a while and I made all my edits on it. But a few days ago, I tried to export a edit and it wouldn't show the precent it was at, and then it would crash and go back to the main screen...I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it still keeps doing it. Can you please fix this?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The best video editing app I've used Self understandable Easy to use
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"First of all I would like to say this app is really good but I think it needs more fixing. I know you guys are working on it and adding new features and turning it into a better app, so I'd like to give some suggestions. 1st you guys should fix the slowmo it's really laggy and not smooth 2nd you guys should add graphs to help us with the slowmo, motion blur and more, 3rd you guys should let us add our own canvas size 4th you should upgrade the adjust setting for us to make better video quality."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'd say 5 stars but there are some major issues. 1. It crashes so much that I can't use it all the time, like when I make an edit I use specific features and it crashes and bugs out. 2. I use the ""manga"" style a lot, and at first it was ok but now it won't work, and I've even tried on other devices, uninstalling and reinstalling nothing seems to work. 3. Lastly some features arnt as smooth while editing an it really messes up the process. So could you please fix this capcut development team."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, but there's very a bad problem. Capcut is crashing. It makes my capcut had a bad wifi even tho I have wifi, Next, is when I'm editing, It always crashes,kicks me out, when I press play, it always sticks to the beginning. Had a black screen. Please fix this, I don't have any ideas how to fix this. I used VPN and it still says ""No Wifi Connection"" I have no any others to explain, but there's a lot of problems happening to my Capcut. Please feedback me once it's clear. Thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the best mobile video editor. It was free till the latest update. The thing is, free version or not there are no watermarks or any of that cheap stuff. It's got alot of features and honestly this is a game changer if you have a creative mind. Paid version gives you extra effects and stuff like that. But this app is honestly amazing <3."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing. I make lots of amazing edits on it. The only problem with it is that its very laggy with some stuff, takes to long with styles and the for you page of templates... Is Absolutely disgusting. But negatives aside. Its an amazing platform."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the different options, I find some don't change anything, but fun nonetheless"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"love tha app so much! It's super easy to use! <3 but... Theres just one problem for me... The auto lines. Get this, I'm just animating then suddenly it vibrates and put it on the middle üòÄüî´ it's just Ssoooooo annoying, I wish that there was a setting where you could remove the auto lines. But it's a really good editing app!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like capcut it's one of the best editing apps ever
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App won't open. PLEASE tell me how to fix it because I use it for my YouTube channel and I post daily and I don't want to let my viewers down. Please tell me how to fix it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update is absolutely horrible. I have been making films with this app for years now and this ""premium"" thing is the LEAST if the issues. Even with Pro, all of the creativity with effects and text is gone. With only about 7-10 fonts. And from what I've seen, no one has noticed this. Capcut was an amazing app, but now this app is disgusting. Please bring back creativity."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Stunningly amazing ..brings happiness üòä. Don't care bout the ads üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love capcut as a Video Editor and making new edits plus they have their own TikTok like erea that you could use Not even mentioning if you wanted to. You can make an edit for others to use. It is so much fun to use. And I love watching other people's work.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Using this app originally was great, little bugs and crashes. However, lately it's been refusing to work with many bugs, crashes and image deletion, and now it refuses to open in general. While it could be something on my part, I am unable to fix it because whenever I attempt to open it, it closes immediately."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so...it was a very great editing app I admit but I like the old version so I downloaded it‚Äî sooo okay let's get into the point. REASON WHY I RATED THIS APP 3 STARS-- -‚òÖ: very lagi when too much picture,key frames,overlays. -‚òÖ: it doesn't allow to use effect when offline unlike the old version that's why I downloaded it in Google. Please fix this problem..I need the effect when offline."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is easy and clear to use, I really like it. I has all the items you need for a pretty good video, but the reason I gave only four stars is it, that some styles for the video are unable to use. I tried to fix it somehow possible with my phone but nothing seem to work. I only have about three styles available but I'd really like to use the other as well. Please fix this if possible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is arguably the best Mobile editing app. But I have two requests to make... 1. Can you give us more exporting options. When a video is exported, one can't view it in some app. 2. Can you give us the option of saving a project to edit in another phone? Thank you, keep up the great Jon you're doing."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I bought capcut pro and it was working great but out of the blue I git signed out and when I try to sign in, it says something along the lines of ""maximum number of attempts reached. Try again later"" I come back a day later, and it's still saying this. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and it didn't save my drafts. Capcut, fix this. I'm pissed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well, this app is very easy to use for edit the videos. This app is also amazing! But I only have one problem when I editing in this app. There are many bugs when I using it and it is hard to complete the edits. So, I hope the developer or whatever it is... Please repair or clean the bugs in this app:')"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy using capcut it was the first editing app I used, but every since the new update came out it's been really hard adding text and other things, I was going to make an edit today and when I opened capcut and added all the clips I was going to use, I was going to add text and once I finished writing the words they all deleted, and whenever they deleted I clicked the back button and these random words popped up and it keeps doing that no matter how hard I try, please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for a very, very, very long time since (2018) but I've been just not happy for half a year now that you have to pay money for better effects now, I understand that it's for business, but still And this text editing is catastrophic for me just can't edit with it! That's why 2 out of 5 stars. I would be happy if you bring the old capcut back."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i personally love this editor, the app is great but I'm so disappointed capcut FOR REAL everytime I try to edit ang then save it (not export) when I came back to finish the video I edited it always says deleted file black screen even though the video is not deleted from my gallery, I thought it's just a bug but no it keeps happening to me and ITS SO ANNOYING. I have to re edit just to finish it PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very convenient and easy to use. I just wish videos won't delete itself after uninsralling the app. As a student, I only install this app if needed‚Äî bcs of limited storage on my phone‚Äîand delete it after use. But, when I wish to watch/save the video again, the video's not there already. I hope you could make that possible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"15th Nov 2023 Hello editor. I wish you peace. I give 4 stars for this app because it is good and addictive in video editing. Only, the file is too big for my smart phone. cause it often lags. for information, I use trail pro to edit videos in this app. And now I want to cancel it because my smart phone can't handle the files that are too big. thank you."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is such an amazing app! It doesn't waste so much storage! This is like kinemaster but better! But the thing is, when you tween in gacha life, you overlay is locked in a position when in the middle, it would be better if you had a mode to leave it on or off. I would personally prefer this only for memes, as I don't think it would be good for a gacha life mini movie It sometimes lags, whenever I try to edit a project it jumps me back to the homepage of capcut which is annoying."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really easy to use and the new smooth slow motion is awesome! The app could use a little more effects though, totally recommend downloading. The new slowmo is just like vsco but free! Now I can delete vsco, and remove my membership, thanks for making this! Unlike alight motion it's so much easier, and less annoying. Barely any ads aswell!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this all the time. But I had to delete it due to storage issues. When I got downloaded it again, almost all of my videos and pictures weren't available to input into anything. I tried to share some pictures and videos to capcut, but it said that the file wasn't available, which is not true because before the deletion, I could input AND share it to capcut. I first thought that it was because I had too many pictures and videos, but no. I couldn't find a way to fix it. So, FIX IT."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love using this to make my memes and don't rarely even find problems. I recommend it to anyone who likes editing or making memes

Capcut is a great app good for editing and content creation but it can sometimes be quite annoying because everytime I use this app, my phone starts to become laggy...I checked if there are any viruses, I erased all the caches, restarted my phone and did everything but everytime I use this app...my phone gets totally laggy...üòÆ‚Äçüí®"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can no longer share to youtube. Limits your videos that are edited to capcut so it doesn't go to your phone gallery and you are forced to pay and upgrade, leaving your video in Capcut jail. I won't ever use this again."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i enjoy it much eventhough i am that prof of editing pics and vids..
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Application is mostly papular and very good All features supper.make good video good music good looking background.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be my favourite video editing app but not anymore. I deleted it because it doesn't save my videos anymore. i spend hours editing my videos, but when saved in gallery it states "" the video/picture has been moved or deleted "" when i clearly have all the original clips in my gallery, no matter how many times i try there is this same problem, so i had no choice but to switch to another app which is wayyyy better !!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is good. There is this one problem though. When I try to put an effect on to the video, it freezes and it makes me exit the app and repeat over and over until the effect finally goes on the video. Please fix it. The transitions and everything is amazing too."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The pro Icon won't go away!!!!!,even if I removed the effect that was causing the pro Icon to pop up at the top right , but the app still considers it using any pro effect that contains the premium, and even tho I undo just that one effect it's not enough to remove that pro Icon, and this just forces me to re edit the video that took me hours to make!!!!, Just this once can the developers fix this!!! ,Bcuz this just wasted my time!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this editing app. This probably the best editing for mobile/iphones. But this app has a big problem that makes editibh preview experience super bad. That is if we use animations and 1 or 3 overlays it makes the preview at thr top super laggy like it doesnt match the music and that messes up the beat animations. So Capcut Please fix this Issue
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing! The app itself is fantastic. Great features and VERY user friendly. Since it is linked with TikTok it is very easy to use nice sounds you found on TikTok! I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for some of the bugs but I'm sure they will get fixed soon. Either way it is a fantastic app! Well done üëç (Edit:After the big template update the bugs were fixed very quick! Templates are so cool!)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, but I may have some issues about it to talk. Well, my problem is adding music. We can't add our own music, the music that we want to add. I would love if this app will make a way, in which we only have to search for the song we need and we get it even if we need it edited. Because, recording song videos is a tough task for me as the screen recording I do only records the screen not the audio. Please make a feature of adding our own songs, else the app is great!‚ù§"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great editing app but not as good as it used to be. Now since I've redownloaded it the app had completed changed. My phone literally shut down for 2 hours and wouldn't power on due to the lag. So I'd say if your phone is a little older do not get this app.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,now more ads come out to exposte videos and most items have been
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, but there's one thing it desperately needs. A way to cut certain parts of the video. You can only shorten the video, you can't for example, take out a section of the video in the middle of the video, to make a smooth transition. Its really annoying that it doesn't have this, everything else is great but thats the only thing making it 3 star and not 5."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really easy to use if you're looking for an app to edit. I use it most of the time for my youtube channel (Kaissy @Kijonu) and it helped me get lots of views, and get stuff done easier and faster. I lag a lot when I try to tween and add lots of effects, maybe it's just my phone, but overall the apps nice."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to give a 5 star but there is a kinda big problem that I hope you can fix. Whenever I putted another video overlay on the other one that I was using, after a transition the video dosent play correctly, it stutter stopping very quickly for the rest of the video. I hope you can fix this little error, because for the rest the app is amazing!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent use on both photos and videos content
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works fine but recently out of nowhere I keep getting these error messages that say ""security risk"" and tell me to update but I'm on the latest version. I don't want to uninstall and reinstall incase I lose any of my data so for now I'm completely locked out of the app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Unorganized Sound Library taken from my Device's Library really is the most frustrating thing in this app as I have to find every single music name that I have from my device one by one and it's a very tedious process. If only it wasn't jumbled and organized based from its folders from my Internal/External Storage will make everything so easy.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really good! I can make good edits with it, rarely crashes and has no lag! If I could change one things it's to make more effects and transitions free since I can't get pro. Overall, solid app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't really like it anymore last time I downloaded it it was perfectly fine and then soon after I downloaded it again it always crashes like, i wanna make or edit a video but whenever I press overlay or other buttons for editing it it always come back to templates please fix it I wanna make content so bad or soon I might jump off a building"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm unsure about capcut anymore, I used this app for almost 4 years but I think I might start finding alternatives. Recently there has been a problem that the extra layers don't work with chroma key anymore. Stop updating AI and start worrying about THE PEOPLE that use this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Been using this since 2 years hehe, but uhm the thing is.. I don't want to say but if the template error about no connection error, I wanted to fix that, because my connection is open and sometimes it errors in any way especially the search was not showing either."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cap cut is a good app and normally I would put like a 4/5 or even a 5/5. But lately there has been problems with the text. And I personally use that a lot. And if I were to try to delete a letter ""enter text"" pops up. I dont know if this is due to the new update from the draw feature. But it would be great if this problem was fixed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used different video editing apps but found capcut very useful! Few suggestions When we use text template it comes in video with animation but it eventually removed without any animation effect, similarly for images if use both in and out animation effect it works only one either in or out animation and most importantly 4k Smooth editing and export should be added! Thanks in advance!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Best editing app, BUT, the videos lag so bad or the sound is delayed, and when you're editing and watch it, it glitches and skips short clips"

Kind of confused plz fix this glitch up and i will give it a higher ranking and my honest reviews about it. Thank you

I choose the clip I want for the template, but it gets stuck on the loading screen at 50% and doesn't work. I've tried installing and reinstalling it, but it still didn't help.But overall, it's a pretty good editor app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with ""CAPCUT"" is an excellent one. It gives me the opportunity to developed, explore and share some great contents with people. I also learned a lot using CAPCUT. I have tried other editing app/software, and CAPCUT has come out ahead. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good editing software. It deserves 5-star plus."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the application often crashes and suddenly goes blank even though the size of the video im editing is small. i can't add an overlay because every time i try to add an overlay the application goes blank and it's just a black page. please fix this.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is great till you want to sign in with an account you created through their website and used a mail address instead a TikTok account. To sign in the app you need to have a TikTok account. You're unable to sign in with your account created on their website. If you're paying for a subscription, good luck with that because they are not responding on any mails! I would have chosen 0 stars if that was a option."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this app was great at first, I made around 6 edits or more before it started it get extremely laggy, and now it sends me back to the home page when I try to add a video or audio. I've uninstalled it to see if that would fix it and I've even deleted old videos or apps to try and stop the lag but nothing works. I hope this gets fixed soon because this is my favourite app to make edits in and I don't wanna try to find a new app to use :P"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"there are issues with the app, when I open it, it just shows a blank screen with 'projects' and I can't scroll and do nothing. i had to reinstall the app a couple times to fix it, and after like 2 to 3 uses, it does it again."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't reccomend it when you try to edit and see the process one last time it lags so much and then whenever i need to use a template I update it to the latest version and go to use a template but it continues telling me unstable network while my network is completely fine, all the good filters and texts are for money so you neeccessrily need to have cap cut pro to make a edit it's a horrible app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Giving thus 2 stars only because of the bugs and it's still not fixed, whenever I try to add some overlays It keeps going back to the main home, so I tried clicking back the video I was editing and still try add some overlays but it kept bugging. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Fix this ‚ÄúSecurity Notice‚Äù a lot of people had experience this problem recently. I'm also one of them. How could i use this app and probably spend on it. If i cannot click a single button on it. The only button i click is sending me here. And there's no latest update or whatsoever. Please. This is really critical bug

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, I've been making summer vlogs recently with my friends but a big problem is the sound, I will import my video into the editing software and it will sound horrible. It sounds super glitchy and just weird I tried to uninstall and reinstall but nothing worked I had to get a better editing app that work 10x better than capcut could ever, do not recommend this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I finally learned how to edit when i learned the basics!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app but sometimes it crashes and won't let you back into your projects so you have to delete them and start from scratch which is FRUSTRATING but otherwise good
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Seriously,I have a great experience with capcut.I have been using it for 3 years.Its super adorable and I love it.As it is a video editing app so I think it would be more good if it has the photo editing allowance too! Overall it is up to the mark!!üíñ"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I appreciate this app ‚Äì it's a perfect app with all the features I need. What's even better is that it's free! Unlike many other apps loaded with ads by greedy developers. CapCut doesn't interrupt my experience and I'm grateful for that.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app ever! I've been using this for 2 years. I love it so much, and I look forward to supporting it. It helped my channel reach 136 subscribers. It has no watermarks too, so I can post any videos using it without a floating thing on my screen. So, I highly recommend this app to everyone!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This application was working very well but ever since its update it is very annoying it hangs again and again it freezes the mobile and editing is a torture please fix it because I don't like any other app for editing except capcut.. I'll be very thankful to you
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I could've rate this 5 stars but the problem is when i'm using ""capcut template"" thing i try it but then there's this saying that i have to update it so i can use the template but when i update i can't it keeps saying try again i updated it twice but still nothing. Then this other one when i'm editing my editing keeps lagging like the video doesn't fit the sound anymore the video is late. Bad grammar."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very amazing app been using it a while now but imma give it a 2star review cause of the lag. And the fact that i can't start a project and leave it and come back to it without any complications after exporting and even when editing cause of that i had to start all over no matter how far I've gone. Apart from that it's a great app and I'd still recommend it but i hope this problem gets fixed
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good cutting app for free but ther are my reaction: Good: easy simple clean Bad: Sometimes just crashed or not working and sometimes it's delet my video. This is so frustrating üòû. Although it's a not bad app but if you can download Premier Pro or other computer apps you should download them not this. I like it but sometimes it's not the best.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to CapCut now? When I'm trying to export a video using a template, it says 'Watch ads to continue export.' However, when I try to watch ads, it takes too long to load, and my internet isn't working properly."

I have filed a complaint on Google play store and tried to follow the directions on how to fix it yet it doesn't work."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Its a good editor but i just hate it when i downloaded it around 120+ mb then suddenly it turns into a 1+gb app when u opened like seriously isn't there any other way to lower it? My phone is seriously about to get full and i need this app because i need to edit some important videos but its just hard with a phone that is about to get full
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love using this app!! It helps make my YouTube videos but just today when I got on my volume isn't working when I import the sound!! I have my phone up all the way my audio on YouTube works and with other apps as well but not CAPCUT!! But overall I'll give this a 4/5!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good for those who are experts at editing. I have been using it for a year now and let's just say, it's Great. When I first started editing, my friends send me this app. They told me it was good for beginners. And I got pretty excited!!! Now I have been using it. It's so good! And you may be thinking. ""Oh well there's ads, so I bet it's gonna fill you up with ads all the time."" No, your wrong. It actually let's you edit. Not like other games. There may be 1-5 ads when your editing. But its good!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I started highschool last week. They wanted us to do a project so that everyone could get to know each other, they said we could use any editing app to do it, CapCut, ae, etc. I picked CapCut because I used it a lot before school ended, so I'm used to using it. When I tried using it, it immediately crash, I had to reset my phone for it to actually work, 5-10 minutes later it froze for about 3 minutes, then crashed. Because of it not working, I got an F. Wouldn't recommend using this app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is overall useful but the only problem is that capcut changed halo blur to be a pro feature and since then I've had to cut back on the quality of my edits, the only thing stopping it from being a 5 star is that problem. My only request is that halo blur becomes free again"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Yall this is good wdym?? Dont listen to the bad reviews. Capcut is so easy to usee, And its very safe to use. This is very very good.

It would always just let me leave a feedback or ""See common ways to solve the problem"", but as it seems, nothing would solve it. I used to love this app because it is truly amazing, but now I can't even download it anymore. Please fix this problem, it's a huge difference between other video editor applications. This is a great app overall."

I made a jujutsu kaisen edit with the characters yuji itadori and ryomen sukuna and an oc of mine and the audio showed up. But this morning when I tried to create a nightcore video the audio wouldn't show up. I've been resetting my phone, closing the app, turning my phone on and off, deleting the app then reinstalling it and the audio is still not showing up"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've had Capcut for well over 6 months and it's an amazing app I love it! But it could it be possible to have an option to turn of snapping? Or snap grid. It would make editing a whole lot easier if snap grid was an option you can turn off. Please add it if possible!! Thank you for the new transitions as well!!

"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the recent update this app has gotten worse? One of the things I used to love about this app was that it was accessible to people who don't want to/can't pay for pro versions of the app, but now that just isn't the case. Also, smooth slowmotion just doesn't work and isn't smooth anymore, reverse straight up does not work anymore either, and it's gotten laggier. This app used to be so accesible and the only editing app I could use on my phone, but now it just kinda sucks."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The Best editing app of all time.Tons of awesome feature that reduces ones editing work and therefore i highly recommend it.But i will say one thing to developers of capcut that they should implement a feature to access editing interface in horizontal but it is only in vertical size
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut is a really great editing app I always use. There are plenty of effects and transitions to choose from and many text styles.

To the person who sees this kindly click ""Yes"" on ""Was this review helpful"". I want capcut to see this. Every Capcut Editors has this problem."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love how this app doesn't have a watermark on it and the transitions as well. My only problem (idk if it's just me or what) is that after i place transitions and effects, when i played the edit, it gets offbeat and lags. I hope it gets fixed or something since I really love to continue editing without the preview lagging."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My go-to software edit, easy to use and very good. Until an error happened, couldn't open the app so I had to reinstall it and I lost all my editing progress and now every time I edit I want to look at the previews but it's just full of lag and I can't see my edit. I hope you can fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was hella amazing but now it just keeps crashing and i have to try multiple times, close out the app multiple times, ect and even made a app complaint and was told it kept crashing and to put it in deep sleep. That worked once or twice then started crashing again. Im glad im still able to open it and use it but its a bit annoying when it non-stop crashes."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate the app for being almost free but if you want to work with a bigger project like a very big video this thing gets so laggy that you can't do anything without having bugs and lags, every time I try to edit a long or very detailed video,it lags and I have to wait for some minutes until it is usable."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this app sm. But this app also crashes A LOT. I spent 3 days editing an intro for my business and all of a sudden crashed and it wont load. This has also happened to a lot of my other edits but luckily i had already saved them. Other than the constant crashes this app is phenomenal .This app has so much potential and if they fixed this one little/really kinda big bug this app would be able to compete with filmora and youcut because you get way more premium free features
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If your thinking of starting a YouTube channel, this should be your go to app. to start with, there are literally NO WATERMARKS, you can remove them as you please. Secondly, you can make a video in a snap, it is that easy. Lastly, there are so many customization options for your video! I can hardly decide on one."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good to use and all of the stuffs are free! Also it don't have water marks! I give it 5 stars but the problem is that when i try to add the affacts it didn't have the affacts! Some other do work but some don't! So, that is the only problem! So,if you can fix that i'm really thankful for that! This is a good app! And this works amazing! Pls fix the problem! Thank you so much!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Worked for a bit, now it's just glitching all the time. I cleared the cache, cleared the tab and opened it again and it's still not working right. It was great before this. Now, whenever I split a clip at a specific place, it splits it way off. Plus, I can't drag to where I need to stop an effect. I am using a Motorola G Stylus 5G, on Android 11. Please fix this."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome features ! Great experience. I love Capcut!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I can't search templates and I can't add any sound or I can't text it sucks üëé
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Capcut app is very essay and video editing is very essay
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Capcut is actually a good editing app with good potential
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good. But it sometimes has bugs which is kind of frustrating due to the fact I play Zepeto and I need this app. But everything else perfect! I love the templates, and I love the overlay button, and it's just so much more easier than having to do all that work on other apps."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Why I rate this 5 stars: 1. The transitions and the styles of text are great! 2. It helps out YouTubers who do not have computers or have money to hire someone to edit their videos 3. It is perfect for people that are new for this app 4. You can add text to speech if your house is noisy but you want to add a bit of commentary into your videos 5. You can add the music that is in the app without downloading music from the internet. This feature saves a lot of my time
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Can make a separate folder like meme sound phonk sound etc. And also the same videos are same separate folder.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This editing app is so amazing I don't need to do so much work on my editing sessions and all that I'm glad there's templates there of videos/tik toks and more! And I have one small issue that I can't get over it is the lagging the loading is so slow I'm not sure if it's the app that's slowing the loading or its just my McDonald's wifi not sure.This app I recommend downloading it's amazing and awesome!!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its perfect! As an anime editor for a year now, I have mastered almost every effect within a week of installing! Capcut is completely free on the app store and you don't even need a Gmail to get in! You just download and use! You can get it on PC aswell. But you do need a Gmail for that and if you need the better version (You only need Gmail for PC) If you want to edit your videos perfessionaly but also easy to start with. I can't think of anything better then capcut!üôÇ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is such a good editing app. I use it to edit my animations for YouTube and it works so well!!! Sometimes lags when you play it back but when you export it, it's all smooth :D it's also very good because there is no premium and you don't need to pay to get rid of the watermark. Definitely recommend :)))"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app. It has no watermark and it's the best. But the reason I gave it four stars is that when I type my text really quickly or slowly it glitches and sometimes put the exact same word more than once. And I have not a lot of space in my phone and this app takes a lot of space. If the text glitch and less space would make this the perfect app for me.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an excellent app! Though, there is a few things that bug me these things r it won't let me generate for the new style effect which is auto velocity and then it takes like half an hour to export a video that is only 10-15 minutes long! But yeah, overall I would give this a 4 star I recommend you try it out!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whenever I try adding something like a picture or audio it takes me off the edit I'm trying to make and sends me to the templates I don't know why this is happening I've tried installing and uninstalling but it won't work still a good app but just bummed [edit] app won't even open and when it does it goes black and shuts off my phone
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learned about CapCut via TikTok and I love it. So easy and fun to edit videos. I like the options available more than YouTube and TikTok combined. So easy to use, with plenty of tutorials and ideas. Lovelovelovelovelove it. So glad I found it!! The ONLY issue I found is that I can't import my own videos from YouTube for editing. But that's minor."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best app for editing/there are many features for editing and many filters and effects we can write text here and costumized it very easily/my recommendation is to use this app. Thank you:)
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The must-download app if you want a free video editor that does all what you want and more. It's amazing how many functions it has, how easy to use it is, and how creative it can let you be with your editing. I'm only giving it a one-star temporarily to bring attention of the team that the app doesn't support Arabic text except if you reverse each line and paste it. I will give it a five star happily after the issue is addressed. Please fix the issue as soon as possible."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I first got it, there was no complaints, making edits was easy and I even recommended. Now it's virtually impossible to edit on the app! Clips I add in don't stay where I left them in the video, but appear where I did on the editing bar. This means I can't adjust, zoom, add texts... please fix it!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really great, you can almost edit everything on various styles. And I really love this app and ive always been using it. But theres this problem that has been happening recently. When I make a text, the fonts/colors/animations etc just wont show up, no matter how much I click it, its not opening. As if its stuck. I did everything I could, re-install, re-open, and some extra things. Still does not opens. Please tell me how do I fix this problem. Except that, this app is a 5 star app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It says it is no secure and force me to download from app store but i downloaded it from here, why?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,China provides the best that they have to offer. This is a feature rich video editor that doesn't force you to buy anything. It is fast and easier to use than any video editor I have used before (besides Samsung Gallery). I was scared to move from PC to mobile for video editing but this software has made my life easy. Thank you for making such a good product.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is so good and very beginner friendly. If you just wanna edit a YouTube video, you should use this! In terms of editing, it's very easy to use. BUT I do think that you should be able to add your own fonts,use two animations on one clip and make your own transitions. Those are the only thing that I hope to be added in the near future."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I could rate the app four stars but I'll stick with three. A great app. I'm glad I discovered it. One thing is that I don't have a lot of options for the closing effect. I think there's 2 or 3 closing effect for the video? I'm not satisfied with that because there's a lot of choices for the opening effects. Yes, it really takes a huge amount of space in my storage but it's worth it. Wish I could see a lot of new things."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not going to give this app a whole entire five stars because whenever I use Auto velocity and it saves it to my clip it just like freezes the clip into one frame so like I could be editing and they could be like a video with a bunch of like different frames on it and then I use Audible ocity and then it just freezes the clip and there's nothing I can do about it and I've tried so much but there's nothing I can do about it and it sucks. So yeah, 3 stars"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At this point it's no use in editing because the good effects are pros now and reached unreasonable prices.. 399 is only 1 month in use?.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Filters are great and easy.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love capcut. This app really finessed us! Capcut has literally everything u can imagine without really having to pay for anything . Everyone is so creative with their templates. Definitely a 5 star!!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The songs were trash üóëÔ∏è I couldn't find any song that I searched
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app it is so easy to use and I love the amazing transitions, but the only thing I have a problem with is useing the audio. Sure it's fine but in a song I have to use the intro and not the chorus unless their is some way to do that. But I can't choose what part of the audio I want to use."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using capcut for a little over a year, and it's a pretty great app. However in the newest update the text is completely ruined and it is 1000x harder to use. Please go back to how the text worked before the 7.2 update. Otherwise it can sometimes be glitchy and difficult to import media. Please fix these issues."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this... Until I didn't. It worked amazingly, until yesterday when text randomly stopped working for me. I can't backspace anything without it adding random code to my text, and it won't save anything with Capital letters. This was the only app I used for editing but now it is unusable. I've updated it, uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my device, yet it doesn't work. Leaving the 1 star review until this is fixed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is best video software app on android I have ever seen. What I love about this app is the freedom to do anything you like with any video also there is no in-app purchases and it is free of ads. The only disadvantage about this software is that it is not compatible with all android phones yet it remains the best in video editing. I will gladly recommend this video to anyone looking for video editor on playstore.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Before, it's actually my favorite app. This app is so easy to use compare to other editing apps. I actually recommended this app to my frnds. I've been using this app for almost 2 yrs. I like this app! Not until, whenever I go to templates it always say ""unstable network"" even tho my net is stable. But I didn't care about it. It's been 3 months but it still says ""unstable network"" so I restarted my phone. But it still says ""unstable network"". I alr deleted this, and download, but nothing changed"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut is a great editing software before but now a lot of the tools that can help you is blocked behind a pay-wall and you would have to buy the pro version just to use it. Not to mention that everytime it does its regular update it doesnt let you do anything anymore. Try and make a video, it will crash and not let you do it. I lost many progress on a video just because of the regular update. Overall, Capcut has many issues with it but it still is decent"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Here's why it's a 3 1: evertime I move a picture, video, or overlay it has a trail and I can't do anything 2: there needs to be better options for the text 3: for a good edit u have to have good shakes and stuff not tryna compare but alight motion all u have to do is press 2 buttons 4: very laggy when I do my shakes they keep on not registering 5: it's getting kind of boring to 6: there should be a option where you can type in a effect instead of searching for it 7: import takes a bit if short"

They are unable to fix it because they require you to report it in the feedback section, but the whole app is completely frozen & doesn't allow you to report it. It won't get fixed. If your whole app is frozen, uninstall it. It's not worth it. Don't try to factory reset your phone it doesn't fix it. Clear cache doesn't work either I'd still recommend the app if you don't have this frozen issue."

The video requires a lot of pics after each other. And usually I would just add it there, edit lenght, and go do another. But.. the photos I add.. suddnely became small. Not as usuall being at the whole place.. but just a small thing in the middle. I can make it bigger into desired size manually.. but when you do that to 20 pics after each other.. it has that shaky effect"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is incredible. It's been so helpful with so many things. I just went from an S21 to an s23 Ultras. The different apps available within cap cut are different depending on the device. Text to image head went away on the S21 but it was available on the s23 however the mock-ups model is not available on the s23 but is still available on the S21. So many uses so much value.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hilarious. Unbelievable. An actual free-to-use Video Editor with intuitive features and no ads or insane payment structures (looking at you Splice and InShot). If you miss the capabilities of Adobe Clip for Android, but want a more modern workflow as well, this is the one for you. Simply because they offer all that they do without obnoxious watermarks, ads or unrealistic pricing structures, I would happily pay for a premium version with additional features since the default stack is so good"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What lack of potential. It auto generates captions - amazing feature but for only some the video. Speech and volume were exactly the same as the rest of the generated video. Capcut refuses to show the last letter of each portion of captions. I noticed a way around this is to add a comma or fullstop at the end of those portions. Only to realise the comma or full stop was placed randomly into the sentence, meaning I have to go back and edit the placement of comma / full-time everytime. Waste."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of if not the easiest editing softwares for mobile if not overall. Very nice to use and endless possibilities. I know that sounded like an npc review but it is true. The ability to use templates is also so nice but I wish there were easy to follow structures/guides to build certain types of videos like versus battles without being restricted by a template.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There's many pro and how about the other that can't provided to register to the pro it's annoyingüôÑ
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great for small fanpages or things as such. I love the app completely and it isn't too hard to learn how to use! The only reason i didn't give it 5 out of 5 stars is because the remove background function gives you a black background instead and I was attempting to cut somebody out and put them in a different place but it just didn't work out? Great app overall though!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app at first for an aspiring video creator and editor and it was great. Until you made camera tracking part of the pro feature? Which is the dumbest thing ever, I understand you're trying to make a profit but camera tracking is one of the most sought after features for movement creators and it just doesn't make sense when it's been free this whole time. Really disappointed."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but uh, finding stuff from your phone is hard. I literally have 100+ audio stuff and it's so hard finding them in capcut. It'd be better if you actually show them in file format because I've been organizing my audio on what's a sound effect and what's music on f i l e f o r m a t. By the way, the search method is just not doing it for me because why would I remember my 100+ audio names."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like edting in this app it works well it's pretty well all the filters effects work well but I hate the ads. And even exporting an 3-1 minutes video you need to purchase premium or you need to watch an ads. I hope yall remove the ads. I missd the old capcut where exporting an 1 minute video doesn't need ads or purchasing things. I hope my review help. And hope that capcut can update into the old one.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"as one who has worked with video editing software at a TV station, we use landscape for interface .. we need to stop view these devices as phones and start seeing then as Mini Computers. we need editors that use land scape in both editing as well as production. the only reason portrait is used is because people think a phone is only portrait based system. maybe Manu captures need to start eliminating portrait momode and force landscape."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Some very sketchy 'updates' were happening called security updates. Especially with all the controversy around ByteDance being linked with the Chinese government I have uninstalled. Also when you search the update on Google play it doesn't come up. On the capcut app it takes you to a weird version of Google play. Very sketchy...

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an above-average editing app, it supports 1080p which is the highest it can go and it can also support 60fps, as long as your video has the right bitrate. My only problem is that the video preview while editing tend to be super laggy when your video's high detailed. Other than that, it's very good!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all but my problem is the new auto velocity feature, is there any possible way you could make the velocity on beat with the song playing? If so pls update it. Also some parts of the app keep lagging but luckily i managed to fix those certain lags, overall, great app. And lastly, how come the clip is off beat with the song i imported in"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app for editing, It's amazing but there is a few bugs like when I go to cut out it says ""Can't remove background try again later"" I think it's spotty reception so I get better reception but it still says it. Finally I force stopped the app but guess what it's says the same thing and bugs like that are annoying please fix them."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"An amazing app for any who don't know any thing about Montage and editing videos, actually it can make you get a very professional results But I have a small complain that the app is only working in the portrait mode which is slightly hard to add a lot of layers and make a big video on this mode, so if you can make the app support the landscape mode it will be perfect Thanks, and I hope you answer me ..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is such a professional editing app, I just downloaded it today and I made a super professional edited YouTube video out of it. It is watermark free with lots of professional transitions, effects, and so many types of text bubbles. I highly suggest you downloading this app. This is the best editing app I've ever used in my life. It also has its own stock videos with loading screens and bad tv screens. Lots of stickers and lots of text animations to use! A professional editing app!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I loved it because you can do what do you want to edit and it's not hard that's why 5 for me

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the best editing app to use, it has everything you'll need for editing and its also free, but the bad part about it is everytime I use more than 2 effects for my video, it starts to lag and its hard for me to edit when it lags, it causes my video to be out of sync, I don't know if its because I have an android, but I really hope you can fix this issue because if this keeps going on then I might have to delete this and use an app that isn't free sadly."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Quite good but you should add a feature where you can manually change the video canvas/portrait, like 5:1, etc... And color boards, you can select them in pictures, it's a album, so you can add videos as colors, like for a intro, etc... And not have to spend hours trying to find the color board, ok so please add these, I'm thinking of switching but this might change my mind"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for 3 years, it's a good app for editing and other stuff. I've also improved alot in capcut since I've been practicing.

That's all the issues I have been experiencing.Thank you."

And she tried it to do her edits and she LOVES it! Thanks and there is one problem, it always lags while I'm trying to edit and I always have to re-installing over and over again so sometimes I can't do good edits because its really laggy and sometimes it shows a black screen in my pictures, I hope you can fix that and I'll rate it a 5 star!üòä"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It was good at first then the songs would play for 2 seconds and the videos would stay quiet
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly it's amazing. Sometimes certain effects or filters don't work and just turn into red cubes. And I'm only a beginner but I'm already doing amazing. And there's no ads and you don't have to pay for anything. I'm glad to use this app. Of course I delete it when I'm not into making edits cause it frees up space.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,for a few days it's been really bad with reverse and auto velocity(these are my 2 MAIN things I use when editing) reverse will take honestly forever to load and then probably around 75% (which it would take probably 5 minutes to get to there) it literally says It won't let me do it. and with velocity it basically takes 20mins to get to 99 then it just stays at 99%. this wasnt just with on edit it's been like this on MULTIPLE EDITS.I've tried reinstalling and updating. it didn't work. please fix
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Is capcut messing up for anyone else! It keeps blacking out certain areas of my footage, not letting me use the fonts and all kind of chaos can someone please please help its stressing me the freak out! Because what is going on with it?"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is very good but now on 27 October I had a problem. When I open project it seems to freeze at 11-12 seconds. It happens to all projects and I can't edit them. Please fix this problem and I will give 5 starts if you do! Also when I export the project it's longer than 11-12 seconds and the music is playing like there is no bugs.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Alright so every time I use this god forsaken app I have a problem. It lags whenever I add text, freeze my clip whenever I try reversing, mess up my files, hiding the not pro filters, effects, and animation. Ive been using this app for over three years but this is just getting more and more annoying. Please fix this or im going back to funimate and alight motion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This editor app is one of my favorite, but! When I use the slow mo feature with better quality, the video will so glitchy specialy when there's lot of light in the background, thats why I give you 2 stars, the feature ""slow mo with better quality"" is the most important for a cinematic video creators like me, so please fix it üôèüôè, I will change it to 5 stars if you done fixing üòå"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app its self is great, lots of things to add and many transitions and effects and its very easy to use and export. But here's the problem.The app can get laggy, and also it one day stopped letting me add an audio unless its from a video. Even with getting the app again.I also have security concerns for this app.I don't feel safe while using this app, especially because I did some research and I found results that this app can take data and spread it around. Please make this app safer."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 1 year. I had no complain. But after the last update when I go to import a video it keeps compressing the video and it's so frustrating to wait 5 min for a 2min clip to import. Before I have added a whole movie in just one click, no compressing, no waiting. Feels like this app isn't going forward but backwards."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Best Mobile app Video Editor I have ever come across. Very easy to use...just take your time to understand the functionality and how use the functions to achieve desired results. I edit videos and get desired result, including adding songs to videos in different scenes...no ads...this app is just amazing...don't waste your money...use CapCut Video Editor for all your Videos...it also allows you remove watermark...what an app!!!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally , capcut is quite a great application. I use them mostly for YouTube and TikTok videos and they come out nicely doneüòäü§ó"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut, my primary editing app but with every update passing by i am starting to have doubts about capcut being my favorite. In 2021 everything inside this app was working fine, no bugs, no glitches that was until sometime later new updates started lagging the app, glitching out texts, placing effects and videos irrelevant to where i want them to be and etc. Adding Capcut ""premium"" in my opinion was so awful, it looks like capcut is slowly becoming into Alight motion."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Thanks for fixing the tracking button. I have complete five star
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app sucks, I am 100% uninstalling this it works on my other device but not this one. Every click every single click I do it takes me out of the app or goes somewhere completely different and I have to click it 1000 time to do something which makes me leave the app"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great effect, filters, editing, and etc. However, it would be even more great if it didn't delete clips and stop glitching while I'm editing my video. Could you please fix that? It would help me alot for future videos and for the sake of others who are facing the same problem. Maybe more..."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't use any effects and transitions....
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's an amazing, free, easy to use editing app with no watermark or anything. it has a lot of features but not to a professional degree. it can be glitchy at times but I think that's just my device. overall it's a good way to make videos, edits, and even edit audios. 9/10 would recommend."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for editing. The only thing is you can't edit with transitions, effects and filters if you don't have data. I hope it would be updated and I suggest just to download the transition once and you can already use it for free but all in all app is good, I love the quality of the video"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Help me a lot to make an aesthetic video, lots of template choices, and easy to use....Love it!"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really easy to use and I really like it, the only problem is the magnetic guidelines or the thing that is auto fixing the postions, its annoying and no way to turn off, so I hope u add a setting where u could turn it off, its just hard and can't put pictures freely anymore. Edit: The new corner radius thing is so good but the problem is that it doesn't keep the height same to other, so what happens is that the other texts don't have same backround heights"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love your app so much but can you make text to video it is so cool and best other app cannot make properly but I am sure you can.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Absolutely amazing app. I love constantly learning and getting better to make videos to the best I can. But the only issue I have is there's no vibration setting. It gets annoying when you have so many effects to copy and paste and my phone is just an earthquake when lining them up.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, but sometimes it glitches af and it's so annoying. Like, I'm editing and in the middle of it I can't even watch the video. Sometimes it can edit really good, but I can't add enough overley on my edit, it's not allowed or it will glitch so bad. It can be good too, I edit in capcut science 2020, it is getting worse, only 2 new effect is good, 2021 capcut is better. I would give it 5 stars if it won't glitch like this. But it's still OK. Yall should add better animations on text. 3 star."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Too many effects have been turned into pro. Now you have to pay to use them.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,So I have been editing on capcut for about a year now and enjoy the simplicity and how easy it is to get around and learn how to use it. But the really deal breaker for me is the constant lagging. One of the main things that really demotivates me from editing is that because some times I will open capcut to continue my work but I glitches me out of the app so often that sometimes u have to completely start over.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Capcut was really helpful and a useful app for me. But, It has a few problems. When I edit something from this app and I upload to YouTube, It doesn't uploads. But, every other editing apps doesn't have this issue. Another issue is that, when I edit something, it hangs. When I edit something, it automaticly saves without even touching the save button. 10 minutes ago, I was editing a video but it saved without touching the save button. How can I edit then?And I wish there was more trending songs."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cap cut is very simple once you get used to it, and It's easy to use for beginners!"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It is a good app I love it it has awesome features but it need to have more new features but all is perfect and I love it keep it upüíï
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Um so basically I'm a big fan of capcut since I've used it for a years now, and the problems became more difficult on this year, the effects that I choose make the whole app glitching. And i don't know why, every template that I wanna use couldn't get to download?? It's not data problem for sure cuz my internet speed is just fine. Please fix it. Or at least tell me what to do to go away from these problems? Yes, thank you.."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The problem is cannot export your project to device, its sucks"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Wish I could say this app was easy to use. It's like going back to college but it's better to watch all the tutorials before using this app unlike YouCut where you can essentially start editing immediately. It's also much easier to use and has the same editing options. I might try this for a few more days but more than likely, I'll stick with YouCut. Sorry CapCut."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It has various stickers and texts. I can apply various templates in just a click. It has an easy to use overlay function, high quality effects, proffesional animation, cinematic filters and a key frame. Everything that I need to edit is just right here. I'm so glad I found this app."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Havent tested it much bit it seems amazing, the only feature its missing is a very simple one, please allow us to edit videos in landscape mode because holding your phone in portrait for a long time is painful and uncomfortable, if there was an option for landscape editing this would easily be the best video editor currently available for phones. Now i get that making it wont be easy because the UI would have to completely be reworked, but just that one feature would make it incredible"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good for editing, but they really need to fix the cropping feature. If you want a certain size, it will crop it too small and won't let you zoom out. Or if you're cropping freely, it will freeze and make you start over.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i've been using this for a while now... i love what the videos are turning out after exporting. but i'd give it just 3 stars (i would've give 2 stars but i'm generous) but anyways, I rated three stars because when I'n editing the video, glitches were going on (green-colored glitch, pixelated glitches, etc.) and it's really frustrating me so much. I hope you can fix this ASAP. Thank you so much."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The reason why I give it two stars a big big big reason but I feel like it's a small little issue at the same time that could be fixed, so far while you're editing is going good and you learn a lot of stuff! And it's good filters and side effects and so on. But when you try to upload it you click the arrow and it brings you to a premium which I don't want a premium I just want to upload my video üò° so if you do fix that I will give this five stars but until then I'll keep it at 2"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used to have capcut. Now that I have it again, I'd love to believe that the app has more to give now. The problem is that it takes a while to function when you're online but after that it's smooth sailing. The number of animations given to us even feels illegal at some point. That's how good the app Is! I definitely recommend. This gets better... NO WATERMARK!!! ‚ù§üíÉ"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of the best apps out there! Has a lot of features that a lot of mobile editors don't and is suitable for projects and fandom edits - this comes from someone who edits a lot on PC. The only downside is the large file size after it exports. Anything other than that runs smooth as ever! Thanks!
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but I have a problem, please read, sometimes I always get a ""Some files are corrupted"" and I can't open the edit I made anymore! I have to repeat the entire thing whole over again! Please fix it, it's annoying that when you work hard for a video and it won't let you open and fix it the ""broken"" on your video."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,AMAZING APP! It's very easy to use honestly I use this app all the time it's amazing so I recommend you should download it tons of effects and I love the videos I'm making when I first got this it had NO adds it still doesn't have any The only thing I'm having a problem with is it won't let me put to many pictures at a time it gets really hard and laggy to do everything when the photos are over 50 it's kinda annoying so if you could fix that thank you but other than that it's great!.

The bars at the start and shop and too big that smaller clips are impossible to select. And while selecting it says clip too small to apply transition.. which i am not trying to do.. i just want to extend the clip.. but its not letting me.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its a good editing app but i cant get capcut pro?
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app, its really cool, and after you get the hang of it easy:) My only thing is that to have whatever music you want, you have to have tik tok- i am not allowed to have tik tok (I am a youtuber) so I personally record all my songs, which can be hard cause I live in a house where theres usually children around, and it is usually loud. But there are some songs provided:) But all over this is a really amazing app and I definitely would recommend it (especially if you have tik tok)"

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great video editing app for all it can do but why does there always have to be one little bug or the other occasionally for an already exported video? It's not a good thing when you've worked on a video for hours and then it comes out with a glitch or something in some clips. Fix all of that up permanently please.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very laggy but it works very well for videos, one of the issues I've been getting lately is that when I add 2 more overlays to 4 existing overlays, those 2 overlays aren't seen in the video, another is when the chroma key leaves pixels of the color I picked behind and the shadow doesn't cover those. Overall has a lot of room to improve but good enough for Gacha Videos"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"After using this for a few days there were a few annoyences, firstly the crop tool needs to allow user to save presets and/or ability to adjust position by coordinates. The VLLO app is better at this. The video import tool needs a search bar, adding audio was problematic with certain mp3s reading 00:00 or not appearing in the list after the audio file had been added to the file system, the built in file picker either needs a refresh button or option to use third party file manager to pick files"
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is my main editing app on mobile because I've always found it convinient over other apps, but over the past few weeks, I've not been able to even open the app and edit. I think deleting the app and re-installing works, but I'm afraid that it'll delete all my projects üò≠. So please allow capcut to save my data so I can delete and re-install tension free."
"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good and easy app. I really recommend when making edits. The transitions are great and everything, but the thing is, the trim thing.

"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give it 3/5 it's a good editing app and like there's no like water marks or anything but like you have keyframes and i definitely think that there should be graphs either custom or not, And like more combo,in,out transition and you can actually double it/put more that one transition cause i think it would be cool and like sizes too either square, rectangle etc.. but great app."

"May 4, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app so much!! But recently it has been very laggy and keeps crashing I have tried it with other devices and other networks and it still was crashing. I would give this a 5/5 but the crashing gets very annoying after you take a very long time to make an edit just for it to crash.

If you could please fix this I would really appreciate it"

It's as if you have premium the moment you enter, whereas other apps give you the most limited amount of edits features it can and makes you spend way too much for premium. You can choose to remove the logo at the end, as well as re-add the logo if you want to change it to any/your creator name. If I could only take away half a star I would, but I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of how laggy the app gets. BUT this only happens sometimes.a"

So can you fix it please because I've had this for like three months and recently it just started doing it again the app is really good it's just it's not showing me my photos that is the issue and it is still not working... I need someone to fix it.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is great and easy to use but if I have to be honest I feel like some of the animations are lazy or cheap. I think they should also add more variety of animations like rotos and more. They should rework the feature were when your moving a photo or video it locks on back to the middle which is really anoying. A way that they can rework this is if they add a button that can lock on back to the middle without automatically doing it. Overall good app but a bit anoying at times.
"May 4, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was a great app.. Before.. Now its all Subscription Based. and though you paid for pro version it doesn't work the same way before. Sorry, but we may have to say Bye2x to this App. I no longer recommend this."
