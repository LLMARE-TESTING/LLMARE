"At the start, it's a wonderful editing app to use, but as im going on. It's not been great, there are a few problems I've been experiencing alot. 1) Whenever I try to miniscreen capcut on my device, it doesn't work and my device gets frozen and I have to restart the device. 2) There has been way too much lag, it's so hard to edit when it's takes so long to recover the lag issues. 3) Whenever using a textbox, sometimes the previous textbox I wrote, it's writing is on the text im using.",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't really like the video quality function. HD and especially UHD makes faces look ugly. Everything else looks brilliant, but faces are mostly ugly, especially in video. However, to be fair, sometimes faces also look well. It seems a small detail, which can be neglected. But in my opinion, human faces are the most important detail. If they look ugly, the whole picture or video is just a piece of junk for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏?
Could be amazing if it didn't freeze up to a point of not being able to use the editing features. Every time I cut a video",,,,,,,,,,
" it has problems lagging while playing back the video. Pausing in between transitions even if there is no transition. It's impossible to edit anything with unless you just keep the video as it is and use the other features but.. good luck if you need to trim anything. I have a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra. None of my other apps do this :0""",,,,,,,,,,
I love capcut and always have but just today I was editing a video for YouTube when randomly the audio got corrupted. the voices and sounds sound like they were put through a robot voice filter. I wasn't editing anything yet just reviewing the footage. I tried hitting the undo button but because I didn't touch anything it didn't have anything to undo. I looked back at the videos in my camera roll and they're completely fine. it's capcut. pls fix this I love this app very disappointed rn,,,,,,,,,,
"love this app! I use this for editing. However, one time i re-installed capcut because the app is so glitchy to the point its crashing. So i reinstalled it. And once its done installing it always keeps saying ‚ÄúApp not Installed‚Ä?i tried many times it just wont install and i have to wait for 24 FREAKING hours to install it back. And the fact that almost half of the effects, things and functions in capcut are all pro. Not trying to be ‚Äúunfair‚Ä?its just the editors need cooperation too.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app helped me with editing heavily, I don't mind about it not being accessible to the premium options without premium and tiny bugs. But there is this small issue, every time I make a video edited, it saves. But when I delete it for more space on my phone, the bytes stay for some reason. If you could fix this, may you please do so?",,,,,,,,,,
Just uninstalled. It became so buggy unusable hence time wasting. Reverse and smooth slow are not working together. They keep cancelling eachother. Reverse takes forever no matter what the size of the clip. Consumes a lot of battery. If the app is left open it won't allow phone to go to sleep mode hence resulting the runout of the battery. Another thing is search function in audio finder is case sensitive which is no practical and difficult to find exact track if you have its different versions,,,,,,,,,,
"Love this app for certain things but it has some big problems, like sometimes l' be editing a video and the whole track turns dark? What's up with that? And whenever that happens I have to restart. It's not nice when that happens. Theres also to constant freezes when I put effects it makes it offbeat and ruins it. But, without all that? It's a great app with amazing and outstanding templates created by talented people and capcut makes it all come to life and it's great on that note",,,,,,,,,,
"CapCut is a great app! Though it does have some flaws, it's a great alternative to using Alight Motion, Video Star, etc.. I do have quite a complaint, the reverse button. Before, (2021-mid 2022) the reverse button worked and did an awesome job, but when the big update/when you created capCut pro, the reverse button now glitches/stays stuck in frames. As an editor, this really annoys me, Ive searched the web, but I can't find a solution to fix it. Please fix this glitch!!",,,,,,,,,,
"When I go to inspect a clip, the app starts controlling itself. When I do velocity, it freezes the entire video. When I do reverse, it starts glitching. And these are just some things broken in my app. I've honestly been using capcut for years, so I don't know why it's randomly broken. But I'm honestly tired of these errors all the time. I always check for updates, clear my cache, etc. But nothing works.",,,,,,,,,,
"I mean, it's a pretty good moble editing app. Like don't get me wrong, I really like it. Buuuut; ‚Ä¢its laggy ‚Ä¢all the pro stuff is reeeally pushed ‚Ä¢when you input an overlay with a transparent background, you might lose it. The apps background is black and the overlay is shown black as well, so it sucks. I wish there was a light mode or something to fix that issue. ‚Ä?+ more annoying issues (but I can't include them all bc of the reviews character limit) Good editing app, but it can be annoying :/",,,,,,,,,,
"Lately, I have been having trouble while editing a few videos of mine. Once you import the video and start editing the app straight up, it delays the videos, making it almost impossible to keep track of what is first or last. It also affects the sound, making it very delayed. I overall love the app it's actually amazing and has a lot more potential to explode, but this, issue sure can be fixed.",,,,,,,,,,
"A decent editor overall, but I'm having a lot of issues with dragging overlay pictures and videos. They don't appear to line up properly when I drag them, and sometimes they will disappear from the timelime but not the actual video. And sometimes the overlay I try to trim shows up as the wrong item. It would be nice if they could fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"ugh, it keeps bugging. everytime I try to use a effect I can't click on it and my capcut crashes, or even a text animation. also, when I try to reverse one of my clips it takes so long literally I sit and wait for almost 25 minutes just so the clip can reverse. and oh my god, also when I split one of the clips on the beat it doesn't go in place, even if I close the app and go back to the project, it still won't split the clip properly. the app also keeps freezing and it is so raging. fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"I have two video editing programs on my laptop but Capcut on my phone does just about everything they do and a few key things they don't. In some ways, the mobil version is superior in my opinion or at the very least, much easier to use with much more intuitive functionality. Yes there are a few inevitable drawbacks (like features only on the mobil version that aren't on the PC(?!) and the mobil and PC versions not being connected at all say like Google Docs is, but overall, I still give it a 5",,,,,,,,,,
"App is great..but am having an issue with video Freeze don't save on device gallery. Sometimes i freeze clip just to edit the image on other apps, then come back to CapCut and finish my edit. But its not possible, then i have to export the unfinished edit, go to my gallery and take a screenshot of the image in the clip i need, editing on another app, then come back to CapCut...so stressful. Other editing apps have this feature. Please make it available on your app.",,,,,,,,,,
"Theres alot of problems with this app, Ive been using it for maybe 2 or more years but I'm not gonna lie its getting more and more buggier. For example: it freezes for me from time to time, And also the text animations stop working even when i try to click it sometimes the text is rlly annoying because sometimes it shows that its in the place that you want it to be but when you click on it, it goes back to where you first put it. Not to mention the ""pro"" system.. I really hope they can fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
App is easy to use and its always my go to but oh my lord does it lag in editing if your video starts getting long. And this might just be a me problem but sometimes text just goes completely forward or backwards depending I try to place it happens with images and sound too Also they decided to remove the thing to let you drag an imagine length and if you reach the edge of your phone screen it would keep going now I have to pause every time I get to the edge and extend and keep doing that,,,,,,,,,,
"This app has bugs such as freeze actually freezing when playing and hit to the end of the freeze effect. Moving images/audios and having them to look like they're stuck in the same position before moving. Once tapping on it, it will gain the current movement and once unselecting it will go back at the same previous position before moving like said.",,,,,,,,,,
"The editor is so good but has it's flaws. If you decide to edit a 10 minute video with for example your screen recording + avatar + camera at the same time being in the video, it will die. It has done weird flickering for me everytime I do a 20 minute-ish video. It's super frustrating and I wish I didn't have to consider saving up for a PC.",,,,,,,,,,
"I'd give it more starts but I can't. There's a glitch in capcut that annoys me so much. For example, I'm trying to put velocity to my video and it freezes. I tried to fix the problem but it doesn't work. I got this problem pretty recently, I don't know for how long has it been because I haven't use it in a while, but that doesn't matter. So this thing, with the frozen screen, pisses me off. Please try to fix it, the app has potential but the glitches ruins it.",,,,,,,,,,
Love the app. Could use some tweaking when it comes to the search function but I am very happy with it overall. I would like to see more music with lyrics available for posting in more than just TikTok. I use YouTube more and find it aggravating that there are not enough choices available in the sounds library for that use.,,,,,,,,,,
Ok so I love capcut. It is a life saver but when I click on the create button to make a video it works fine until maybe like 10 to 15 minutes later where it crashes. the whole app entirely. It's still happening it's actually gotten worse the amount of times when I'm making ONE video and it crashes out is absolutely crazy PLEASE FIX,,,,,,,,,,
"I love using capcut but everytime I try to edit a video, it just Feezzes. Or when I try to pause it but it just freezes and I can't unpause or pause. Then sometimes I hear audio. I'm very disappointed because I love editing but I'm not able to. Please fix the lag!",,,,,,,,,,
"Don't Waste Your Money on PRO!! I've been using it a little over a month now. When it works, it's great. But the numerous times that it crashes or gives you a ""no internet connection"" error when you try to use the paid-for features, you'll wonder what you paid for. My phone browser works fine which means the no internet error is bs. I requested a refund and support told me to ask Google. Then Google said to ask the developer since it's been more than 48 hrs. I really feel robbed of $54.99.",,,,,,,,,,
"The app is alright, works smoothly. But the problem is...for an unknown cause. When I try to input a text, it doesn't seem to appear and I tried to figure out the cause, there was no problem. I tried swiping my screen because it was probably hidden in the corners, it didn't appear as well. Please fix this bug, it stopped me from continuing to edit.",,,,,,,,,,
"genuinely loved this app! but I can't update the app anymore! and even after I try to update, a security note keeps popping up! I uninstalled and installed again and I'm not even able to open the app anymore! at first I thought I was unable to update the app because of my phone storage, but even after clearin up storage I'm unable to fix this issue! please help",,,,,,,,,,
"It's an incredible app! I use this all the time for all sorts of shenanigans, and it does not fail to impress me. If I were to change something, though, it would be a feature where the video clips can snap onto overlays. Makes it easier to perfectly time green screen overlays with video clips.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app too much, even my videos on YouTube get many views due to the editing but there are some really serious issues with this app, for example whenever I try to type a text the keyboard doesn't appears sometimes the video doesn't exports, sometimes this app shuts automatically, I don't know what's the problems but I think so that the creators should focus on these problems. I request üòá",,,,,,,,,,
"I like the app. However, there's only one issue. and if the update fixes it I'll rate this 5/5, Ok! my issue is when I just trying to export a song it just keeps backing it goes to the home page and when I try to repeat the situation it is just keep forcing to go to the home page, Please Fix (Thank You!)",,,,,,,,,,
Really great app for editing. Edit:I'm facing lots of bugs after i switched to SAMSUNG A70 with a good processor smooth slomotion takes age's to apply in templates and during editing please fix this issue cause I'm an editor and o post templates but this bug is annoying me it slows down my whole phone. Anything i open during smooth slomotion my phone lags alot,,,,,,,,,,
"IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WOULD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS APP. Every single time I try to watch one of my projects it always freezes EVERY MINUTE and I have to restart the app. Also I can't even search for stickers, it only has the ones that they put in it. Oh yeah, and also all of my projects that I worked so hard on are gone because I I deleted some scenes or moved them, it doesn't make any sense. What an excuse for an editing app. Please fix this garbage AND GIVE ME MY PROJECTS BACK!",,,,,,,,,,
"Hands down the best, most intuitive, and easy to use video editor ever invented for the Android platform. It also renders lightning fast! And thank you for not making me register just to edit a video on my phone (you can just hit the ""x"" At the top of the login screen). Perfect!",,,,,,,,,,
This is the best video editing app I have ever used but I wish it'd actually work. The app crashes often when I overlay images or try to export a video. I've been trying to export a thirty second video for weeks now.,,,,,,,,,,
"The old version was best. In update version I have found so many problems but the most annoying problem is template search option. When I tap the search button in template it shows ""couldn't loud please try again"" and I can't fix it. In the next update please fix it.",,,,,,,,,,
I have used this app since 2022 and it has started to be a pain. It keeps on crashing on my long edits with multiple (10-30) clips. It also has been taking a long time for my video to post. Please fix this. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,
"It was all fun when it was free and all but I didn't use to edit much but i only used the templates many time. Few months ago I tried to search for templates and the search bar just goes blank and I can't type anything on it and now I tried uninstall and reinstall it and it goes ""there was some issue installing""",,,,,,,,,,
Want a refund this is horrible. What is wrong with the app. I'm about cancel my subscription and go to another app. Can't do anything. Everytime I try to save my project it crashes and sends me back to main screen. That's trash. I'm paying pro version.,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, to be honest , this WAS very useful but not now! Idk why , I'm trying to edit a video and that's done but it isn't saving .. all it has to say "" EXPORTING... please don't close the app or lock your screen"" it has been a hours and it's not saving and it's getting me annoyed even tho it's my frvt app :< this app is very useful but I prefer ""was"" . Pls caput Community team Fix this matter and I would love to give it a 5 stars hopefully ‚ú?Thank you for your effects",,,,,,,,,,
"Love the editing skills I've learned from here, and I got quite a few likes on tt because of the templates here. The only reason I rate it 4 stars is because they don't have all my favorite songs that I would love to edit with. But overall, this is great üëç",,,,,,,,,,
"crashes down, takes forever to do simple things. ive been waiting for hour and a half just for it to reverse 6 secomd video. trash. its been forever and crashing down only gets worse. probably the worst app you can use for editing.",,,,,,,,,,
"The app performs well but has issues with chroma key and auto-captioning features. Lack of popular transition effects also affects user experience. Despite drawbacks, the app showcases impressive capabilities for a mobile platform. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëè",,,,,,,,,,
"On low Chipset Mobiles Capcut don't work smooth and I face many problems, Can't apply smooth slowmo which is the biggest issue. In old version it work good, slowmotion was applied easily but now it don't work, so kindly solve this issue.",,,,,,,,,,
Wonderful app that i use frequently HOWEVER there is currently a bug where auto velocity doesn't function properly and it glitches on a frame from the clip for the entire duration of said clip :/// really frustrating and i cannot figure out a solution,,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is very best app , but I faced all time a big problem in editing time . When I edit video so I don't match video audio voices because of app crashing and lagging. Please Capcut team fix it on time . Thank you",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a good editting app, but please remove the invisible bar for showing timeline near the pause/play button, it's so frustrating sometimes i accidentally click it and then i need to search or scroll again to where the timeline i was doing. Please remove or atleast make it visible so i can see without accidentally touch it.",,,,,,,,,,
When I logged in I did all the basics but then it asked what I want to post on. I misclicked and chose tictok not youtube. I uninstalled the app thinking I could just log in again and click the right button this time but I couldn't and it just wanted me to log into tictok I looked up what to do but couldn't do anything. Please make it so that you can change what app you create on.,,,,,,,,,,
"Why why why do you keep breaking important features in the app. This time it's the teleprompter, where the edit button doesn't allow you to edit the text box. How do you expect me want to pay for pro when I can't trust you to keep the free features working?",,,,,,,,,,
"It would be a nice editing app if it wasn't so laggy and glitchy, it also doesn't let me update it and it's really frustrating I think I'm just going to go back to kinemaster, capcut has got some serious issues to fix.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's good most times but when you open it wanting to use it nothing displays for a long time. Today it's been more than 5hours. Other days it's been longer. When I try to update to newer version, there is no update required. Why does it do this? It's annoying. Can you please rectify the issue for the app so it does not freeze and if it does, for whatever reason - allow the user to update to newer version. Thanks",,,,,,,,,,
It's ok but there's a bug example I'm going to use Animation but I don't want to press the animation I'm going to use and then I freeze the resolution is good but when I extract it it lags So I'll rate it 2 because the cupcut is bugging,,,,,,,,,,
We are not satisfied with the new updates. It is not allowing us to open old projects while I've saved all the data in my gallery. We need this issues resolved or we don't need any updates give us the older version please ü•∫,,,,,,,,,,
Lag! It's impossible to edit now. The lag is horrendous. It was great when I first started using it. But now it's impossible to edit videos to suit music. Please fix this.,,,,,,,,,,
"Great app for editing videos. Very simple, I do have one complaint though. Can you please remove the feature where you can skip to parts of the video by clicking near the pause button. I keep missing it and get sent 25 minutes into the video when i'm editing at one minute.",,,,,,,,,,
"keeps making previously not pro features pro, and shoves it in your face, making it hard to find the things you want, because simple things get buried under an onslaught of new pro features. i frequently get issues when using the text feature as well. i get why they wouldnt let you just hide the pro features, but its so annoying when you just want in and out, and not have to scroll up and down 4x trying to find something that used to be on the first row",,,,,,,,,,
"So this app has alot of freaking glitches that always pisses me off, just like the text, when i type something and i want to replace a phrase, the new phrase that i changed loses 1 of its letters, like when i change ""just"" it'll became ""jst"" its totally pissing me off like capcut was better than this before... there's no app better than capcut however i wanna change my editing app... Also i have issues with the text-to-speech feature, it glitches like crazy! From 3 stars before, going down to 1",,,,,,,,,,
Its a great app. Makes things simple and perfect for editing. But alot of users would like if there was dark mode on CapCut. I edit mostly at night and its not ideal to get flashbanged with such a bright screen.,,,,,,,,,,
"I love CapCut but y'all really need to fix the glitches with the velocity effects I can't finish my edit because it just freezes up every I try using it. I can't even uninstall and reinstall the app because it will delete all my edits. upset: I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app and the problem is still the same, I can't use a single velocity effects without it freezing.",,,,,,,,,,
"this app is literally stressing me out, i keep reinstalling it bcs it's always saying ‚ÄòSecurity Notice‚Ä?saying that the version of the app is not stable and not safe when it's literally the latest version like capcut is getting worse and worser day by day, please fix this issue it's literally annoying.",,,,,,,,,,
"I recently just discover about CapCut, and I really love and appreciate the things about you can do in Capcut, whatever you want. But, now that the new update came. Everything is laggy like even when I only put some like one effect and will all be laggy and everything is not free anymore like all of the things need to be brought by Pro. (Which, I understand) the only thing is bothering is that it's really laggy and sometimes it freezes my phone.",,,,,,,,,,
"Updating my review... Please, actually fix these bugs. 1. everytime when I use auto velocity, the video stops or turns into a black screen. 2. everytime when I reverse, it almost crashes my phone, and it literally crashes capcut. 3 everytime when I undo auto velocity, it goes STRAIGHT to the beginning of the video. im gonna be using other apps. You guys STILL didn't fix those mistakes. Please do",,,,,,,,,,
"Would be actually good if the mobile version would bloody function. It just crashes when you try to put the slightest effort into editing, or when you try to deal with audio",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for 4 years, but the last year, it's been super laggy to the point I can't even edit properly half the time cause I can't see what I'm doing. Playback freezes & lags, especially with the transition to the point I have to export the video constantly just so I can see if it's lined up with the audio. Another recent issue the last couple months is that the audio won't export at all or it cuts off at the end. Sometimes, I have to export it 3 or 4 times before it works.",,,,,,,,,,
"Dunno about anyone else, but I'm able to make 10 minute long videos with this, it all falls along one simple strategy : 1. Start video, export around halfway. 2. Take the exported video now, continue until done, if it doesn't crash, then no need to export twice, only problem is the fact that it lags quickly after around 10 effects / clips if not put back to back.",,,,,,,,,,
"I would rate it 5 stars but... I searched for Dynamic blur but it doesnt appear for me. I have updated the app, restarted it, cleared cache, but it still doesnt work. It used to appear but now it disappeared. I know its there because my friends sent me some screenshots of it being there. So please just fix this glitch, never make it happen again. PLEASE. I just want to do an edit :(",,,,,,,,,,
"This used to be my favorite editing app, but it's gone downhill ever since the Pro membership. Most basic functions I used often have now become for members only, I can't use most effects or animations without paying for it, which defeats the whole purpose of getting this app in the first place. That isn't even mentioning the terrible lag whenever a video is more than 100MB of data, or that the sound is most often not aligned with the video. Please, bring back old CapCut for everyone's sake.",,,,,,,,,,
It's great for editing at the start and the templates are super useful! Althought there will be some lags and it my be slow as the storage space is quite high,,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely loved this app it's easy to edit on and easy to make videos for Tictok!. Anytime I try to save the video I will click export and it will crash the server and kick me out of cap cut I restarted my phone and everything but it keeps crashing. üôÇ,,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this app for years with no problem, but suddenly there is ALOT of glitches. Firstly whenever you start editing a video it suddenly speeds up the video at the start, causing the edit to be 'not on the beat'. Secondly when I try to reverse a video it crashes the whole entire app. Please fix this!",,,,,,,,,,
Text randomly starts gliching out. U can barely edut with good effects. Sometimes just ruins your quality The problem is that every good effect is locked behind a paywall All the free ones are okay at best but the pro ones are just some of the best things are seen which is kinda ridiculous since not everyone can pay for pro. Not to mention how some of the best free effects have been moved to pro so you cannot use some of the old free ones. I understand they need to make money that just too much.,,,,,,,,,,
I am a beginner when it comes to the field of editing but I am a fast learner. Learning to use Capcut app was great however when I finish editing the whole video I can't export it. And when I try the capcut pro features always pop up like I just want to save my edited video for the first time. And this app is ruining my mood.,,,,,,,,,,
I am so done with this app. It's decent at first other than some unnecessarily difficult bits. But when I save my edit/video it screws up the timing on the whole video and ruins it. Some of the stuff that happens when I save I don't even understand how they get so screwed up. Fix you're d@nm app.,,,,,,,,,,
"I am a Capcut creator and all of a sudden I am having constant problems with the app not acting right , keeps crashing and messing up, and even though I pay for Capcut pro it still doesn't work right. And I definitely can't get all the features to work, features I'm paying for.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been experiencing issues with lag, issues exporting in which the app crashes every time I attempt to export a video. I have reached out to capcut 3 times and received no help. This is really disappointing especially considering I pay for pro and I can't even export videos.",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is easy to use but there are some glitches to be resolved like app close automatically ,when I import new file it close and reverse to the home screen.It took 10 hours to edit 7 minutes of duration.because app close automatically ,after 2 to 3 attempt it doesn't work.And make it use in offline sometimes we have no internet and editing affect due to internet",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, I do. But lately, it's just been running so slow for me, I know it's not my internet or my phone. It's the app. It's also been crashing more. I have no problem with the sound lineup or anything. It's how slow it is, and it crashing constantly. I hope this issue can be resolved.",,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty good for editing. I wanted to reverse a clip that was a couple seconds long and it crashed the app. Retried it multiple times, even created a whole new project but it would always crash.",,,,,,,,,,
"Idk why but this app has issues now I can't even use the search bar anymore, I thought it was probably my connection but no it's not be it signal or wifi it doesn't work and now I can't even log in Edit: after I uninstalled it and install again i can't edit anymore like it shows no internet connection but my wifi connection is excellent and this app can't even run properly Take note: only this app has problem could you fix this asap",,,,,,,,,,
This app was really good I've been using it for about 2 or 3 years now but I'm coming to my breaking point where I'm about to quit using it because they keep putting every thing on capcut pro and I'm not gonna spend my money on that. Every thing I used to make my videos look good have turned into capcut pro and I'm not happy with that so I'll give this rating a 3. 1 point taken off for the fact that everything is capcut pro and another for the fact that it kind of works slow.,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing app really good! But there's one issue with this app, sometimes when I go on it the song is on yk from the template and then when I get off the sound is still playing? Capcut, please fix this issue but overall this app, its very fantasticü§ó",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for years, and it's been incredibly helpful. However, I have an issue with the way it compresses videos, especially when they're long. It takes a lot of time, which can be frustrating. I'm really hoping this problem gets fixed soon, and I'm eagerly awaiting the update.",,,,,,,,,,
"So good, I do all my editing on it. But for some reason it now goes really laggy and would freeze when I watch me edit. I have to export it so I cab watch it without this issue. I don't know how to fix it",,,,,,,,,,
"It's good and all but there's just days where I'll edit and it will literally lag on me, It's either I can't type anything, I can't click anything, it will freeze or it will literally just crash on me, wether it'll be for text animation or generally just video effects,Please fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"I was just trying to make a thumbnail and every. Single. time. It crashed and said ""Sorry something went wrong do you want to continue?"" And I say yes and it still crashes and doesn't resume! And when I try making a video. It says ""Not enough storage!' WHEN I HAVE 76% FREE STORAGE!!! overall one of the worst editors ever.",,,,,,,,,,
"Its really good! Although i do wish they would make it free, i don't like the pro system. Its also really buggy and freezes while im editing. I really hope they fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"Because of CAPCUT, I've been able to make some very impressive videos and without a SEO. It's an Amazing AI Intuitive APP... IT DOES ALL OF THE WORK AND I JUST USE MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES, MUSIC, TEXT TRYING TO PROMOTE MY BRAND",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a good editing app, sure, but there are WAY too many bugs... The frames freeze at certain times and sometimes when I go to a video in it, the video doesn't play and I can't do anything in the video editor after going into the templates. Sometimes, when I use a template, the audio doesn't play. Sometimes I have to click on a video twice to enter it where you edit videos. Besides that, there's quite a lot to do but that's my only positive thought about this app..",,,,,,,,,,
"By far my fav video editing app for mobile (and the expanded options on desktop(. Once you figure out what everything does, it's super user friendly. Really love the expanse of feature included, and I moved to pro pretty quick. Took a star off because it tends to crash more on mobile, e.g. Randomly closes during editing, not saving a particular effect (doesn't matter what kind but usually to do w/importing a photo or video clip), out of sync audio to the actual clip when in editor mode etc.",,,,,,,,,,
"Love this app for certain things but it has some big problems, like sometimes I'll be editing a video and the whole track turns dark? What's up with that? And whenever that happens I have to restart. It's not nice when that happens. Theres also to constant freezes when I put effects it makes it offbeat and ruins it. But, without all that? It's a great app with amazing and outstanding templates created by talented people and capcut makes it all come to life and it's great on that note<3",,,,,,,,,,
"Over all its a great app! the features are great, and it's easy to use! the only problem is that recently, I have been having this glitch where after about 20 screenshots on the editing screen goes all black and I can't edit anything. I tried updating it but that didn't help, hopefully this will be fixed because I promised my followers a mini movie.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app but there are way too many bugs. Once these issues are fixed I'd be more than happy to up my rating. 1. Keyframes don't work 9/10. 2. The lagging is horrible, especially while working on a long project and losing progress because of it. Something that would also be appreciated is more availability to premium items; Making them free in return for watching (a) video(s) per use.",,,,,,,,,,
"Really good app for a beginner but has a lot of issues - will often glitch out, especially when using text - will sometimes look completely different after exporting - will have playback issues, and various other problems. The app is often slow and I find that whenever I'm making a video with a lot of short clips, it struggles to play them in time. Another small issue I have is that you don't have the option to select multiple clips at the same time, this is a minor issue but is still annoying.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is good for editing. Many new features are introduced which are amazing for editing. The only problem is with the sound option. I want to use the sounds which are installed in my device but the app starts to lag when I open the ""sound"" option and after some minutes, it starts to work normally. Please fix this issue because it's very annoying.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a simple and good editing app, but there are a lot of glitches and errors. Yesterday, I was working on a video that took me over 10 hours (with breaks) then capcut crashed, and when I opened capcut and tried opening the video I was working on, it says ""some footages are corrupted"" for no reason at all, and I couldn't open it. Many other people also experienced this. Capcut please fix it",,,,,,,,,,
"I'm an editor, and use two different apps to do so, CapCut is the one I use for clips to make sure I have better quality, sometimes I'll even use it for a velocity from time to time. Though, recently, they've started making ridiculous things for PRO, for example, 'Fps Lag'. Which is ridiculous and is just a simple, quick way to earn money. Many other effects have been victim to this, too. Not everyone wants to pay for an app that's original motto was ""free and easy"", that's gone out the window.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a very great app. Has so many features. I use it for a lot of things. I have a couple problems with it though. For one I use it for my YouTube videos and when I edit a video, it always freezes in the beginning of a clip for 2 seconds and it gets so annoying. I hope this gets fixed because Idk what other apps I could use for my YouTube videos",,,,,,,,,,
"The app is pretty good and easy to use, but honestly all the things you have to pay for are just annoying. I've been using this app to make edits recently, but all the really good options like effects and animations for videos are all locked behind a pay wall. It's really dissappointing to find an effect that really matches what I'm looking for just to see that only 'pro' users can use it. But besides all the things that require you to pay for Pro, it's still good to edit with in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,
Needs an audio waveform like YT create. Capcut definitely has the most features and it is quite useful except for the fact that there's no or of the box audio wave form. Yes we can separate the audio from the video to see it but that's not the same as just having it. The editing process is so much harder without being able to see where to cut the audio,,,,,,,,,,
"Works, kinda. It's... an OK app, to say the least. It DOES have editing features, but that's just all editing software. Although, I'm not sure if this is just me or not, effects make animated text break. Also, if you have a lot on screen, it lags a lot. (this could be due to poor optimization, but it's not that big of a problem.) Otherwise, it works like a video editing app.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a fun app. Lots of good filters. My problem is their lack of control on your personal settings, blocked users still being able to send notifications and customer support being stupid and giving blanket responses that don't actually help anything when trying to reach out to them. Making it sound like it's user error that a blocked person is still sending me messages",,,,,,,,,,
"Editing is all good and it's a great app but lately the app doesn't want me to create new videos, the previous projects that I did covers the create button and I can't make edits it's frustrating fix jt",,,,,,,,,,
This app is great it has great editing features like pull in and out and zoom which are great aswell as animations but the only reasoning for 4 stars is cuz iot get the shake it requires so many steps while if in on another app it is much simpler.,,,,,,,,,,
"capcut, i'm sincerely asking u to fix the issue i am facing rn: when i pick a music from a local library, it starts to log and then go back to effing start, like from the start start of the capcut likeee what !??? broo i'm editing a vid that's due in an hour and the only editor i trust is testing my patience! pls fix this cos my heart is beating so fast while typing this. edit. IT'S NOT FIXED. DAMN U CAPCUT update: April 13, 2024. still not fixed. i hate this app sm",,,,,,,,,,
I love how many effects and uses this app has for video making it can be used for effects in videos or if you are just editing characters it is super fun to use but why won't velocity work for me anymore it just freezes the video?,,,,,,,,,,
"even when i re-install this app, it keeps saying that i don't have any internet connection but i am really connected on wifi with an excellent signal strength, i can't even edit anything on this app. fix this issue",,,,,,,,,,
The speed has a bug. It doesn't stay on the speed screen and keeps exiting when you click one option. I'll change my review once that us fixed,,,,,,,,,,
Good on the apps but when I was on the browser version for Mac the screen keept zooming in durng the diting process making it impossible to see what happening so I cant really edit that well... Please fix,,,,,,,,,,
"I can't even use the app or create an account. Every time I try to pick one of the options like ""sign in with Google"" or ""sign in with TikTok"" it says I must be over 13, making the app unusable. Note that I am above the age of 13 and will be getting my learners permit soon, this app needs to fix it's issues.",,,,,,,,,,
"This used to be one of the best editing apps.. But now I can't say that anymore. While editing or trying to use the audio function, it just freezes.. Don't know if I am the only one experiencing this.",,,,,,,,,,
Very useful and once you know how to get the hang of it then your edited video will turn our great; although it is quit hard for bigginers and pretty hard to improve (just my opinion).,,,,,,,,,,
"It's quite a good app for beginner - intermediate editing, and I see a lot of people use it on YouTube with extremely good end results ( I'll never be as good as them though ) The only annoying thing is how recently, a bunch of the free animations, effects, whatever you want to call them - have become paid, which is really disappointing because they were free before, and it makes editing feel more limited and unnecessarily paid :/",,,,,,,,,,
"I loved using this app until i found out that clicking ""speed"" isn't pretty much working, cause I cannot click just because of the phone storage. That's why I don't pretty much prefer this app. If you turn your edits like pictures longer, the faster the video goes. I'd really love it if the 'speed' button can be pressed without anything with the phone storage",,,,,,,,,,
"All in all, I think it's a really good app. Everything works smoothly and there's quite a lot of option for editing. The reason it's not getting the full five star is because of the removal of the makeup filters. There used to be some really fun ones, but now I can't find them. Also, this might just be my inexperience, but I can't find the option to actually cut parts ot of videos. You can trim the ends, but in the middle as far as I'm aware, there's no way to cut parts out.",,,,,,,,,,
CapCut is a great editing app! There's lots of effects to use and it isn't at all confusing but there are some issues. There's CapCut Pro which limits the resources you can use for edits.,,,,,,,,,,
"I like the app, it's fairly easy to use and convinent. However it is way too glitchy, it crashes and freezes and doesn't properly play the video. This makes editing extremely difficult. Recently with the new update I can't even run a simple edit without it glitching and destroying the quality",,,,,,,,,,
"Actual editing and UI, good, better than Alight Motion for my device. The only issue is the lag. I make timing sensitive edits, and the preview freezes everytime I scroll beyond a snails pace, or go backward... at all. Clearing cache, opening up storage, even clearing data didn't help. The reason I chose CapCut over Alight Motion was that Alight Motion lagged.",,,,,,,,,,
"too much glitches, getting back to homescreen after choosing a picture, and please, fix video flickering problem after exporting, ive been sending reports and got no replies, also no solution, 0 user service, 0 solution, absolute 0 for everything."," I am a small gachatuber who's new to animating. I've seen a lot of animating tuts on YouTube so I gave it a go. I wanted to use a sound that's trending I won't tell you. The problem is; I couldn't find the sound. No other popular sounds on YouTube are NOT on Capcut (some are some aren't) which Is a big problem. If this issue has copyright issues I understand. It's just so tiring that I have to extract a sound from a video to have that soundüò´ but good app. üëçüëç""",,,,,,,,,
"pretty good app, easy to use, but one thing that puts me off is the lag. it just stops the entire app. so i expect this issue to be fixed soon. but then it could just be my phone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏?
Personally this app is cool for quick easy edits. But somethings are annoying like not being able to change the music on certain templates or having to have an account to access certain things. What I disappoints me is the fact that I can't see templates when in different countries. Only certain countries allow for templates to be viewed.
Hello",,,,,,,,,,
Love the app its actually better than ppl say it is however the reverse button doesn't work which is really annoying as an editor and when i smooth it or whatever its called and smooth the slowed videos it changes the quality so please fix that,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay, so it's an amazing app! You're able to use templates, save videos for sound, and even be a creator and get paid! Though the problem is, I just applied to be a capcut creator today, and for some reason, it got accepted immediately, but it said it'd take 1-3 business days. As much as I was confused, I was also kinda happy. Although I keep making templates, and for some reason, it's not letting me post any of them. The button isn't there. I've tried relogging in, nothing. Fix this, please! üôè",,,,,,,,,,
"alright, the pro features are quite irritating, especially since just a year or two ago, everything was free. but if you try hard enough and do some things with slight work arounds, you can recreate any pro effect. Still annoying as hell tho. But one thing I cannot stand is all the new updates! There seems to be a new update every week, and it's just over small things, like changing icons, or even making more things pro. Atp, eventually I have a feeling everything is gonna be payed.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app would be better if there's no bugs,It's just weird like the sounds are just moving away every single time I just tap them,I need to Make this video quickly bc my school project is happening.So if I didn't Finish this,I'll give this 0 stars (if possible),pls finish the box quickly",,,,,,,,,,
It's a good app but I was working on a edit and I went to templates really quick and used one of those ones for a different one and now I can't find the other one I was working really hard on,,,,,,,,,,
"It could've been 5 stars but lately I can't export vids, it keeps crashing when it reaches 27% and idk why. I tried clearing cache, no prob with storage, clearing tabs, rebooting phone and updating the app itself but it didn't even change the outcome. I still can't export videos. I paid for subscripition so I can't have any problems and there's this. FIX THIS. please",,,,,,,,,,
"It's definitely meant for basic video editing. It allows for these cool editing stuff, but don't even think about it cause Capcut will NOT create that video for you. I tried to use the remove background feature to make a donation video, but capcut couldn't even play the video. It was just a blank screen video with the capcuts logo at the end. Even cutecut works faster than this",,,,,,,,,,
"the app wont even let me open it. i've updated the app but it's still stuck in the same screen. i've tried reinstalling this app but it's still stuck in the same screen again. please, fix this problem then i will give 4 more stars",,,,,,,,,,
Paying for templates then error and they still charge !! twice i have been charged and twice the Ai has failed sayin no connection which is false as i have full wifi and data no issues this happened before i ignored it assumed one off but its not and you dont get 2nd chance not happy,,,,,,,,,,
It's a coo and unique way to edit/meme things from your phone! Just wish we didn't have to pay for filters on the app. I just hope I don't have to pay for the other features that didn't require payment before üôèüèΩ,,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love this app, used it for quite a few years, lately its been laggy and horrible to work with, text is glitched and every good feature is becoming pro and its an extremely expensive price for just a few features that i will actually use. find a better editing app before you use this one, yes it is simple and easy to understand but there are plenty more with a lot more variety of effects and text transitions.",,,,,,,,,,
"Needs to fix some bugs. Sometimes, it'll freeze a frame for a few seconds of the video, and there's no way to fix it. It now doesn't let me edit without an update that doesn't exist. Also, it isn't an app that should need the internet to work.",,,,,,,,,,
"Well, my experience has been decent. And I like the app. But it won't post my remakes. Says they'll be under review. It's been a week, 4 remakes haven't posted. Like someone help me. And it won't let me send screenshots on the agent chat for someone to help me. What the heck?",,,,,,,,,,
"I used a template called: what would I look like in the 80s... And I have to say I was amazed at the transformation the app produced. It seems like that the software is really sophisticated, it was able to produce a real likeness of myself. I have to say it's a picture that I'm going to use to inspire myself to recreate in reality for myself. I rate this app five stars no question! What took capcut 1 minute of computer magic to achieve is going to take me 9 months in the gym and a ¬£1,000 suit !",,,,,,,,,,
"there is a bug where you can't put your pict, it's horrible and annoying. when you put the pict you'll crash from the app. fix. it.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's okay but sometimes it glitches and doesn't save my projects or refuses to even function at all, really laggy too. And it got worse as the app would crash a lot and my project is unsaved",,,,,,,,,,
"I am now experiencing a problem where the app constantly crashes. Whenever I apply a smooth motion to slowed clips, try to export, or anything that requires some sort of process. I have tried multiple things to stop it (e.g, clearing cache, freeing up my storage, deleting other drafts, restarting my phone), but nothing has worked.",,,,,,,,,,
"the app is wonderful but my notifications for messages are coming back around 10-20 minutes after theyre sent by a follower on my posts, and my other friends on here also agree that theyve been having the same problem, so can you please try to fix that ? other than that, i have no issues with the app really, other than that whenever i go to post a video with the camera function, it takes a really long time for it to be verified, which is very annoying to me, as i post a lot !",,,,,,,,,,
Everything was perfect! But this restore thing annoyed me it couldn't install..? Also the green screen was so easy to use! Please fix the restore thing From Zana.. (don't show my name on public please),,,,,,,,,,
"AS A LONG TIME PAYING MEMBER (over 2.5 years) every video I post, above every description, there's capcut. It takes away from the posting, which is for our business. It's very frustrating for one, shouldn't have that issue as a paying member, and two, never get customer service. They always seem to be ""closed."" If there was another platform, I'd switch like yesterday.",,,,,,,,,,
"Tried the 7 day trail and and up paying 9.99¬£ I accepted the 7 day trail, tried to edit a 6 min video with the PRO features but it freezed at selecting a cover for the video and then at exporting the clip. So i cancelled the trail and then noticed that i've been charged almost 10¬£ for it üò≥. Other then that, the app is really simple to use and has some good features even on the mobile free version",,,,,,,,,,
"the tweening feature carries this app but apart from that theres a lot of issues. half the time theres some kind of export problem where the result is discoloured, blur and other effects are weaker than intended and the audio (if extracting from another video) is off timing and you have to correct it manually. the only reason i still use this is because im too lazy to learn how to tween on other apps",,,,,,,,,,
"fix your app please, its too buggy and laggy, the sounds dont go to where i want them to be, and it sometimes freezes for me, i almost didnt pass my output on time üòí so please fix it, hope everything will be fixed, thankyou.",,,,,,,,,,
"Majority of the good filters require payments - not to mention the app constantly crashes and freezes, losing your progress. It's not worth anything",,,,,,,,,,
whom ever did not check over if the app would work and then randomly go back to the title screen and losing Your progress. But under than that the app is great ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚ò?I like this app very much but the problem is that whenever i try to use template it takes too much time even my network is good but still it takes more time can you fix this issue? Otherway its a very good app thats why i am rating 4 starsüíï,,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut, tell me why you're forcing me to buy Pro. I spend a lot of time on an edit just for it to say I'm using Pro features when I'm literally not. I have double checked everything and tried everything, but it will not let me export. It could so easily be a five-star review if this issue didn't exist.",,,,,,,,,,
"I been using this editing softwarefor a few years now. And it's been quite good, but now it's not, because of the lag when I make my videos I won't use this editing software until it's fixed!!!",,,,,,,,,,
"I love the features of this app, but it keeps crashing whenever I make videos longer than 2 minutes. Please fix this problem.",,,,,,,,,,
"what the heck happened to capcut? like it gets buggier each year. this time, the smooth slo-mo function doesn't work AT ALL. even tho i set it to ""better quality"" the slo-mo is still laggy. pls fix this",,,,,,,,,,
"Ive been using capcut for about 2 years now but I don't know if we're going to 3. Recently capcut has been logging me out randomly and it now refuses to let me log in on any platform. I used to love making videos but now every time I turn around theres another issue. Like now, with templates the audio doesn't catch up with the video.",,,,,,,,,,
"Oftenly crashes, Harsh lags, 30 minutes to export. What else? This is just a horrible app for low end devices. I feel like today every app expects us to have an iPhone. Get Alight Motion, it's simply better. Dont bother getting this app, would honestly rate it 0 stars. Even how much I try to use the feedback option it just doesn't help me. Even here, it's just a bot saying ""use the feedback option"" really capcut?",,,,,,,,,,
App has incredibly annoying snapping you can't disable that makes putting things where you want on the screen incredible frustrating.,,,,,,,,,,
I used to love this app but now on mobile the velocity doesn't even work anymore it just freezes the video and the reverse is worst please fix it I don't have any other editing app,,,,,,,,,,
It keeps on crashing everytime I open it. I've uninstalled and installed several times but still keeps on crashing.,,,,,,,,,,
Why is editing on capcut now a chore? You try editing audio and the entire video freezes. Taking days to edit a 10 min video. I take back my 5 stars initial review.,,,,,,,,,,
"I tried to create a 16 minute long video recently, and right when the exporting was 99% done, Capcut crashed. Every time I try to export the video, it crashes before it can export. Fix this",,,,,,,,,,
"Everything is okay but funny voice pack is Not working jessie, trickster, and bestie voice pack is Not working my mobile is connect with internet but capcut say no internet connection please solve this issue as soon as possible. Thankyou",,,,,,,,,,
it's a good editing app for beginners but when I try to put a file I can't find it I put it in every section and cannot be seen pls fix this issue,,,,,,,,,,
This app is in a completely unacceptable state (at least on mobile) its super laggy and crashes all the time. Fix this absolute dumpsterfire.,,,,,,,,,,
"Once again, an editing app that just does what it should do, quite a bit of the features are locked behind paywalls but all the essentials are still free",,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely love it! Very intuitive & easy to use. Produces great quality videos easily.,,,,,,,,,,
"It attentionally best app but I have a issues, my phone is Poco m3 Im using is done repair and the issues is about why the image is rotating even when I need to move my image in capcut, I'm sorry if this app was not clear app for me.",,,,,,,,,,
"Great app but sometimes problem with some function like spot blur, enhance voice, isolate vocal, reduce noise and sometime working slow",,,,,,,,,,
"While i was exporting a 2 hour video, and waited for a long time. when it was at 99% the game crashed.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's giving me internet issues and I can't search any catalog this app may have :( I will update this review when it is fixed, but I did try re-installing.",,,,,,,,,,
COOL when I screen record some videos to have fun is blurry but still capcut is much better than my screen recorder but I still use my screen recorder and cap cut to make duets!,,,,,,,,,,
good app! but takes away lots of storage but a nice app to help you edit theres bugs sometimes and capcut keeps crashing so a 3,,,,,,,,,,
"It keeps showing me a security notice on my screen, giving me the details about the version that needs to be updated and so even if I update the app, the bag carries on!!",,,,,,,,,,
"Perfect for little, or huge edits. However, lots of options require pro.",,,,,,,,,,
"Simply put, wasn't expecting all the extras. Super fun, creative juices will be triggered. Get both the mobile & desktop version. Enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,
This is good for editing but my phone keeps lagging when I use to many effects and it doesn't let me click new project pls fix this error thank you,,,,,,,,,,
Since new update everything is worse when I'm editing the audio .. Always having issue when i wanna drag the audio part it always run or missing üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª,,,,,,,,,,
This app is so laggy and capcut you have to have better settings cuz your delete button is always there I keep deleting my clips so fix that man! And btw your lagging fix that too,,,,,,,,,,
"Brilliant fun, especially how easy some of the green screens are without needing all the tools",,,,,,,,,,
"What's the point, mine as well make me pay for the app, evrthing is pro and it's not even worth buying pro because how laggy it is. I can't even make simple edits, only good for YouTube editing but besides that, doing anything else with it like TikTok edits it's useless because it would freeze",,,,,,,,,,
"Nice application, I really like it. Unfortunately, I have an issue which edited video is not able to export. How to solve it?",,,,,,,,,,
"crash for no reason in the middle of editing,effect and sound placement bug.",,,,,,,,,,
"I use Capcut to edit my gacha videos and it's an amazing tool, when it comes to effects, cropping, editing and much more. But the only flaws that the app has are some cool tripping effects are ONLY for paying users, and at first the app was for everyone not needing to pay. My other issue is the templates, they are nice for new commers to try there best but in my opinion the only reason why people have the app is only to use templates without trying. But overall I enjoy using the app! - 2/12/24",,,,,,,,,,
"I like the app a lot BUT... This is my 2nd week using the paid version. After a phone OS update, I get the ""can't share video"" error when exporting to TikTok. I now have to choose ""Other"" to find TikTok way deep in the list of apps. How to fix this to get it back to his easy it was at first? As of Jan 4, the app is very useful but still have the same minor problem above.",,,,,,,,,,
"This is usually a great app, but for the last 2 weeks, there's been countless bugs, and it's impossible to edit videos now. Example: I tried to batch the auto captions, and after, I can't unpause, undo, or full screen without leaving the edit. It's super annoying, plz fix asap",,,,,,,,,,
Frequently freezes and makes you start over. It's very frustrating.,,,,,,,,,,
"This is probably the best app to use if you are a beginner because it's simpler than other video editing apps. Sometimes when duplicating audio, overlay, or parts of the main vid you have to click the button several times for it to work. There is a slight delay sometimes between audio and images.",,,,,,,,,,
"I like this app, the reason it got a 4 is beacause sometimes it's very glitchy when I edit, also when I decide to watch back the video sometimes it speeds up and ruins the sound, also could you make it so you can name extracted audios? Cause I have a hard time finding some of my extracted audios. Otherwise this is a good app.",,,,,,,,,,
"After the update i try to edit some video and export but I can't share to TikTok because I can't see button sharing after export I only can see is ""done"" no watermark just video top can you check please",,,,,,,,,,
"good for very simple edits but utterly impossible to use for anything more. if you want to make a video with short clips in a quick succession? nope, it lags. clips will freeze in the final product for no reason, the audio will lag and delay. for such a popular app its incredibly surprising how utterly broken it is",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut app is great for editing and has great templates however the latest app update, I'm unable to access anything. Even after clearing background, cache and restarting my Samsung Flip 5, Android 14 phone. It's frozen either on edit or templates tabs screen and none of the button options works. Please fix this!!! I paid for the Pro version to EDIT and not to stare at a frozen screen and do nothing. 1 star because I'm frustated at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a good app for editing and all but it keeps saying no internet connection or unstable internet connection, it takes a lot of storage and internet plus it always suddenly crashes in the middle of editing, seriously they gotta fix those because it's a very good and useful app but I can't work with it anymore no matter what I do, I tried clearing my phone and making my internet better or using a strong vpn and all but none of them worked",,,,,,,,,,
I can't sign in on my account and I can't access any of the templates anymore this has been my issue ever since the update. My connection and wifi is fine.,,,,,,,,,,
Clearing the cache deleted ALL my voiceovers in ALL my projects for no reason. Frankly screw this app. I've written hundreds of emails to capcut support and sent feedback messages where I provided them with the projects as well as screenshots AND screenrecordings to show how clearing the cache makes the voiceovers gray and silent with no other opt than the delete button. Every response (if I got any) was the same bs automatic message telling me to update the app. UTTER garbage. NO communication.,,,,,,,,,,
App is creating bugs and working too slow and some template is stop. Resolve the issue at pri.,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a great app but I can only use the templates because when creating my own edit it lags alot and then when I export it, it ends up way faster and the text doesn't line up correctly. This has started happing in the past month and I would really appreciate it if this issue was resolved.",,,,,,,,,,
"I use this app a lot and even though I'd like if all the things were free my complaint rn is how many times its crashed. Not just on my phone but other people's phone. Whenever I'm editing for a certain amount of time, it stops playing the video and I have to edit the app or restart the phone. plz fix this",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is quite great for editing, both template and self edits :)) But 1 star is missing bcz sometimes when I enter the app, nothing comes infront of the screen. All the icons are vanished. So, I hope this will be repaired. :))",,,,,,,,,,

"[Update] Ok, again, why with random updates we aren't asking for? I'm just tryna make videos and it keeps messing up the audio causing it to sound the cut off towards the halfway point. I would like to get my videos done but it's impossible with the whole audio issue. Please fix this issue Immediately.",,,,,,,,,,
"this app used to be so cool until they started to make all the good effects ""pro"", lots of lags when you import a clip or multiple clips, especially when i make my own velocity. this kinda ruins the experience of the app, please fix the lags immediately.",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is Good for editing, but I gotta tell you, y'know? Most of the Features are literally pro, example: Shake, shake is now pro? But wasn't it Not pro? So ig they changed it to pro. But there's no new Smooth Graphs? Almost everything is like, pro. And also, when I export a 1 - 2 minutes video, it literally crashes?? There are many bugs in capcut. Could you please capcut, Fix those bugs? I'll just give it a 3 rate star. I don't have anything to write here, so, Yea, that's all I wanna write.",,,,,,,,,,
"I can never log in to use the branded music option. Its always giving me issues and I can never edit whenever I want too. Its doesnt seem to matter what platform i use to log in to. It always says ""maximum numbers of attempts reached. Try a different time"" which seems sketchy as hell to me, so you definitely lost me a costumer.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is a disaster. When i try to get a effect, it freeze me and i have to force disable the app or restart it. And, it contain LAG. It is now expensive, when u need a effect, u need to pay money! This sucks. Old capcut better, thats why now i moved to alight motion and now i can make alot of cool/slay edits with alight motion bc IT DOESNT LAG and its perferct for my phone. Dear creators, Remove capcut pro and bring back old capcut, please... it was better...",,,,,,,,,,

"New year and same old issues. They optimise many good things yet didn't fix the same issues. Sometimes now, capcut just shut down randomly, and afterward you can't use it at all for a couple hour unless you clear all data",,,,,,,,,,
"UGH. Everytime I make a lyric video it always crashes, or responds too late. Please Bytedance, fix this. My lyric video is literally messing up I can't even handle the pressure üò≠",,,,,,,,,,
It is not working properly it will crash sometimes. Or it won't let me sign in saying ur connection is poor when its perfectly fine,,,,,,,,,,
"Glitches sometimes but overall pretty good Edit: You can't do anything near complex without it lagging or taking forever. I tried to reverse a 0.6 second video and it took me 15 minutes for it to finally complete, then it'll just randomly crash. Updating didn't even help. This app just keeps going downhill after every update.",,,,,,,,,,
The best app for editing. I'm using it from 2 months. I got experienced very quickly and now I'm one of the best editor on Tik Tok... This is my account tariq.khan3382...let's check it out üï∂,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a great app I've been using it for years. it can get laggy if you use to many layers in one section, but it makes up for the amazing quality and it doesn't have a watermark to ruin the video.",,,,,,,,,,
Been using for about a year with little to no issues but all of a sudden I try to edit a video and it tries to compress it and the bar won't move...,,,,,,,,,,
"Great app! Been using this for good while but past few days, the text part is quite glitchy and text animation aswell, everything else works fine",,,,,,,,,,
"It's really good, but it's quite hard to edit, so you will need to watch a lot of tuts, but if you're doing a simple edit with only pictures, you'll be fine over all the best editing app ever.",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know why but i cannot log into this app using mt facebook nor my tiktok account (which are the options for logging in). I would really want ro use the templates but I just cannot and it keeps on saying unstable connection even though my connection is fine.

"I have never faced an issue really except for the fact that today, when I opened my phone, there was a cloud on it, I clicked it and it said to reset, so I did and now it isn't happening. Please fix this issue",,,,,,,,,,
Terrible support experience. Pro subscription kept requiring age verification. Age verification broken and instructions in Chinese. Support was not helpful. Requested refund. Took 1 1/2 months to get refund. Beware.,,,,,,,,,,
"some issues need to be resolved. Pashto language isn't there so it should be included. Another issue is that when writing Urdu , one has to change the language of the app, this too is very irritating.",,,,,,,,,,

"Would love to use this app, but every template I try to use gets frozen at 50%. Can't use it at all. So disappointed, it seems like a common issue but I really hope they fix it.",,,,,,,,,,
"It was good at first because the only problem I was having was that there was no template button so i could not get templates but then i updated it and now i cant do anything it just says ""no internet connection""",,,,,,,,,,
it's so great for editing but my only issues is that if you don't want the watermark to show you have to use tiktok please fix this :(,,,,,,,,,,
App crashes and lags. I can't even export a video anymore because the app crashes. Totally worthless now,,,,,,,,,,

"At first it worked well, but as time passed by the quality dropped and dropped until it can't even function properly anymore.",,,,,,,,,,

"It is good, but there are drawbacks to it, such as the difficult designs that require a lot of time. I wish they could be simplified",,,,,,,,,,
It's good overall but don't know why the background remover feature is not working in my device. I request capcut to help me with the issue.,,,,,,,,,,
Could be better Theres alot of bugs that get me extremely annoyed like when i cut an video and it suddenly and randomly sends it back too the beginning of the video and i cant fix it. Also when i reversed an video it turned the whole video into a black screen and it only went back too normal after unreversing it. some features dont work with other features that i just wanna use together like when i apply an style too an video after slowing it down it completely undoes it,,,,,,,,,,
I've been trying to import an audio (wav) file but can't find it. I've used wav files in my projects before without any issues.,,,,,,,,,,
It's nice and I actually loved using it but one issue when I chose audio and go on sounds it said capcut isn't responding and needs to be fixed,,,,,,,,,,
Capcut isn't working in my phone. I reinstall couple times. Templates are not showing. Please resolve my issue.,,,,,,,,,,
I try and save my videos and once it gets up to 50-60% it stops and kicks me off please fix this I've seen my friends with this issue too,,,,,,,,,,
They are always updating the app with amazing new features and templates!! It's user friendly with lots of how to guides. I'm getting the pro membership soon because it's affordable and worth it!,,,,,,,,,,
It's a very good app .I am happy with video editing with this app . I have been using this app for years Haven't found any errors so far .,,,,,,,,,,
Capcut is good editing app but recently It says it have some Security issues & I can't use it at all. Please fix it ASAP!,,,,,,,,,,
I keep getting the security notice error even tho i used the official one from google play. It's annoying...help,,,,,,,,,,
I really love that app everything is good but I have one issue is that whenever I try to open the project ut opens then again closes automatically it don't run,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is really cool! üî• The templates make it even better but my issue with this app is with my photos üì∏ When I look through the templates and start finding photos, I have only resent photos that I've taken. Please fix this it would help a lot and also for me to update this comment üí¨ Thank you üôèüåπ",,,,,,,,,,
This is app is amazing... When it works. Most of the time whenever I'm editing the video will freeze and lag. The editing features are cool and all but what is the point of that if the software itself doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,
It's a very good video editing app with lots of editing options. It doesn't have a watermark. Though the reason why I am giving it a 3 stars is because it crashes everytime I export the video. Please fix this bug,,,,,,,,,,
What have you done? ‚òπÔ∏è I can't export any videos now because it freezes on the export screen. It will get to a certain percentage and just... stop. It worked once after the recent update and now it's broken again. Been like this for a week.,,,,,,,,,,
Cap cut is an amazing editing app it's really good but it's not anymore it's the only editing app that I actually know how to use but the templates have ruined everything now everything revolves around the templates everywhere I go it's the only thing I can find there are no more original edits not to mention people are stealing other edits from people and posting them on the cap cut templates people are claiming that's their own edit we need to put an end to these the ruining everything.,,,,,,,,,,
If I wanna do a trending edit that someone posted. It always slow and the sounds never match up with the pics. It's good but I wish they would fix that issue. It happend with my old phone too so I don't think it's my phone issue.,,,,,,,,,,
"The app is okay, and I love it, I really do, but there were some problems where it tends to get glitchy A lot When I play the video to view, it skips and then plays And when it gets to one of the things I edited on overlay, it freezes and then skips everything",,,,,,,,,,
"When I edit a video example if I export a photo or video in a edit, it crashes. And it is so disappointed for me because i don't know how could i say that if I export some photos or videos It crashes!!! Even though the storage and others are all fine!! FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!",,,,,,,,,,
Ever since yall started to put the new updates there it's all ruined and there are lot of bugs you can't even Fix by closing and opening the app + the stupid new pro thing it has to be EVERYWHERE and it's really getting on nerves most of the time when you're trying to find one effect. Lost all my motivation for editing becouse of this so 1 star.,,,,,,,,,,
I really like the app however since last couple of months there is issue with projects exporting! app just got stuck in the middle of exporting and its not because of high resolution or unsufficient phone memory. Hope to be fixed soon!,,,,,,,,,,
"I do like this app but I have some problems, 1. It freezes the video when I reverse it, 2. It brightens up when I export it and reverse and it's annoying, 3. SINCE WHEN FPS FLAG BECAME PRO LIKE WHY(please remove the pro in capcut and the fps flag effect with the pro on it, please and thank you.", few very very frustrating bugs and glitches but it is quite easy to use, one huge issue I'm having is I can't seem to log in with anything?? Tiktok, email, Facebook," nothing works. It just says """"Try again in 24 hours"""" And then it still doesn't work?? Please fix.""",,,,,
"I really like it, yes it's annoying when you need to use pro features but you can screen record it and still have it so it's not THAT big of a deal. I personally really love this app and I find it very easy to use and it's really good for me since I use it to edit gacha life. =) 5/5‚ò?
it's definitely a good app to start editing if your a beginner I use it all the time it's just the problem is when I edit a video and I go and delete the unedited version of that video thats in my gallery it also deletes the edit version on caput so I have to edit the video first save it to my gallery then delete the unedited version which can be quite stressful because that can take so much space up on my phone when ever I'm editing a long video I hope that this gets sorted out
Great app",,,,,,,,,,
"would be flawless if 1. they'd stop making everything a pro feature (what happened to ""free and easy to use""???) and 2. if it would stop crashing everything I try to export a 12 second clip with good framerate.",,,,,,,,,,
"I am using this app for 4 years but never any problem but from last two three months this app is having problem templates are not working and more so this app is acting weird I have updated this app not once, updated repeatedly, uninstalled and reinstalled but this app is still not working Capcut team requests you to fix any issues in Capcut app as soon as possible so that old Capcut users don't uninstall Capcut.üåö",,,,,,,,,,
Wasted a lot of my time. Keeps crashing and failing to apply the changes. Every time it crashes it starts from the beginning applyong the changes. And so on. Regretted buying it. And I paid for the pro version!,,,,,,,,,,
"Good, but it's been laging these days... I try to use the template option for new ideas, and it shows ""no Internet connection try again with connection "" even when I'm fully connected to the internet... please do fix this error as soon as possible. It's getting frustrating now",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love this app, but when I exported, the audio was either cut off completely or out of sync while I spent a day editing. Fix this now. This app is getting trashy, and they refuse to fix any issues.",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know whats different errors occurs there after recent update. Now i am facing wasting my time to write captions, its auto writes dublicates and other side suddenly audio option disappeared . and it takes tooooooo much time to select videos from gallery kindly solved it and fixed it",,,,,,,,,,
"Its a good app, I use it for like 1 year and a half. Its a very good one for beginners because there you can do greenscreens and other things, I tried to do greenscreenfor my gacha videos and it doesn't work, in kinemaster and other it works so please fix this, well btw you should really use it, and fix the greenscreen please, :)",,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE THIS EDITING APP! This is one of the few free editing apps and the quality is AMAZING! Let's me edit whatever I want and there are even templates I can use through tiktok on this app! Super cool! I use this whenever I want to make an edit and it NEVER crashes. Keep up the good work!,,,,,,,,,,
Love it so much it is SO easy to make and edit it has been helping me with youtube and tiktok it is the best edit software and it's free. But there are some problems. My quality easily gets ruined with it and when I make a little more than one minute thing it lags horribly.,,,,,,,,,,
"Wow, the lag has gotten worse. It now lags when it reaches 2+ mins. And it's even worse than before. And you are not even fixing it üò°. Why are the developers being so lazy to fix this lag? Literally half or even every user is facing this issue. So why can't you just fix the lag? It literally lags even if you tap on something. If there were negative numbers to rate on play store I don't know which negative number I would choose. Do you literally expect us to export a video 10 times?",,,,,,,,,,
It's really good but lately I've been having issues I've been trying to import videos to edit and I've imported videos longer than 1 hour before. But this was 30 minutes and it blocked it for me and I was trying to edit for my youtube channel,,,,,,,,,,
i have found a lot of mysterious features within this app and very interesting in the way they work. Am really privileged for that and very humbled. At first i didn't know how to use some of them though I wanted them but after a while i started catching up and now I can at least use many of them. Capcut is now becoming an incredible software to my side. i thank all the custodians of it's building your really doing a great work. Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,
"It's great but if they could let the arabic texts better and not like separated ""ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß"" and not ""ÿß ÿ® ÿ≠ ÿ± ŸÖ"" Not even in order just reversed??? And also it keeps laying even tho I do nothing much just splitting the video and then al of a sudden I can see my phone's logo on the screen (it's restarting by itself)???",,,,,,,,,,
"Ive been using capcut, but ive been facing technical difficulties.. whenever i would save my video it would freeze all of a sudden, even when im editing a long video. It freezes alot. I have to restart every time, please fix this bug..",,,,,,,,,,
"Genuine question, why tf would I buy pro, when the free version doesn't even work? I've tried exporting an 18 second video 5 times now just to have it turn out glitchy. (Update on the 18 second video, it took 12 tries before I finally figured out that all the available canvases cause the video to glitch out so I just settled for the void of black for the canvas and that worked) really disappointing though cause I was thinking about getting pro üò°üò°üò°",,,,,,,,,,
It's my all time favorite editing free app. But the issue is it keeps freezing and it's really annoying and im so irritated rn. I put alot of effort on that one project and when i play it it always froze like what. I hope y'all fix this soon im hoping..,,,,,,,,,,
"It's 3 stars at its very best, you can do alot of things with it, but as an editor is very frustrating because they keep changing the filters constantly and it's full of technical issues.",,,,,,,,,,
So I'm paying for PRO. Every time I go to use a PRO feature it tells me I need to pay for PRO. Yet it's active in my subscription and I'm being charged for it. This will be the second time I'm charged without someone solving the issue. Not even a mention of money back for services I'm paying for and not recieving.,,,,,,,,,,
The app is so laggy and unoptimized. Good luck trying to edit only to loose your work in 10 minutes when the app crashes and the project is corrupted! There's no way to recover the project after so convenient!,,,,,,,,,,
Its a good editing app but I have one massive hate with this is that next to the full screen and play button is a invisible bar that if u put your finger on it it will drag u to the very beginning of other points of the video they need to remove this feature cause its so distracting.,,,,,,,,,,
"Was a good app I used to edit thousands of videos but since they now make it impossible to edit anything without having premium, I'm deleting the app and trying some other editing softwares, took all the good settings like ""shake"" and smart sharpen and ruined it, completely unacceptable",,,,,,,,,,
I would say it's good for making edits but the templates are another level they are awesome but it kinda ruined the app just a bit it dose the editing for you so u can't edit ur self because most people use templates and lie that they did it but other than that the app is perfect as it is.,,,,,,,,,,
"This is a good app, but a meh to me. Whenever i try to use this app, it doesn't let me enter and crash everytime. No matter how many times i enter, it'll continue to crash and crash. Good but annoying app.",,,,,,,,,,
I'm kind of Annoyed at capcut for this one. I used some of the effects FOR FREE for the longest time and now all of a sudden some of the basic functions like Fps lag are pro. Dont get it it's not worth it it jut feels like they are trying take yor money at this point,,,,,,,,,,
"In the last version, it was actually okay but this latest version of it is killing me üò≠ It's hard to edit the pictures and vid, when I cut / split the picture and delete it, it is not deleted really, there was it still but what was just shown is a black screen, tf",,,,,,,,,,
I have a message for you all capcat fans there's a problem with this capcut app when you trying to remove background on your photos it couldn't remove is there error messages they said couldn't remove background try again this is the problem i'm facing using this capcut app i i am very upset that i can't remove the background of my video üò¢,,,,,,,,,,
"This app came from a 4.5star to a 1star. I'm aorry but it's functionality over features. It has many feature's but too many bugs. When I'm editing something for example, i press play and the timeline is not moving at all. I have 0 ways to use it. It literally is good only for TikTok templates and not even for that cause even there the clip si moving in 3fps.",,,,,,,,,,
Really good but when screen recording it takes the sound away do it's just silent also it doesn't give you a choice to keep it private,,,,,,,,,,
Hello this app is amazing but my videos export in very low quality 4k export option not showing in my Capcut please fix this issue,,,,,,,,,,
Almost 95% of CapCut now requires Pro subscription and CapCut Pro is so expensive like almost 200 Turkish Liras per month. This is almost NOT the original CapCut. And I do NOT use Pro features and CapCut says me that I AM using Pro features but there is no Pro feature that O use is displayed. FIX IT!,,,,,,,,,,
"before this when i use template everything is fine but lately my capcut have been crashing üò¢ when i edit a video , in the middle of the video , the picture became pitch black . please fix this üòû",,,,,,,,,,
"I enjoy using the app, it just so, please enhance the green screen more and put more vfx effects so that we can enjoy it more üëå",,,,,,,,,,
"I get black screen every time I try to edit any video, really poor performance.",,,,,,,,,,
This app is one of the worst editing apps bugs crashes I've lost 3 full edits to bugs and almost every useful feature is locked behind a paywall i get it you need to make money somehow but at least fix the god dam bugs. Im gonna learn alright motion now goodbye.,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything requires money. even a simple blur in effect, and you need to pay money to access it.",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to use this app a lot, but I don't really now. This was a pretty good app to create videos and templates with and it was just plain out fun to use. The problem is, when I tried to make edits or something, it would kick me out and not save. And I'd have to start all over, making myself irritated. Also, when I'm exporting a video, my screen would randomly turn grey. Other than those problems and other similar problems this app is great. And I would love you to please fix these issues.",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a useful app for you to make videos,it has awesome filter's and cool editing features, but there are some type of problems. First one it freezes what your doing and in just a few minutes and goes back working again but eventually it goes to freezing the screen, second it lags everytime we click on some of tools . But this is an awesome app if your learning to edit and easy learn",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a great editing app to make high quality videos on. However, the only problem is exporting long videos and what happens. At a certain point of exporting (for example at 64%) the app crashes and sends me back to the projects menu. The only way to stop it from happening for a while is to uninstall the app and reinstall it. Please fix this to make this rating even higher üòª",,,,,,,,,,
"Installed but keeps showing the security issue blabla, repeatedly installing and uninstalling this app, nothing works.",,,,,,,,,,
"Some features on this app are completely free, while they are sold on some other software like inshot. Plus, it does not have an annoying water mark at the bottom of the video. Besides the fact that it crashes a lot on my phone, a techno pop 2f, it works perfectly fine. I blame the crashing on my phone, not the app. The PC version is also very good. 10 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,
really nice effects and all but the screen always glitches and goes black.,,,,,,,,,,
DONT BUY THIS PRO APPS. KEEP LAGGING WHEN EDITING HD VIDEO. GARBAGE APPS. KEEP CRASHING. U WANT TO EDIT BLUR 480P VIDEO ONLY? FAK U. DON'T WASTE U MONEY HERE. IS NOT EVEN WORTH IT. HOW TO EDIT WHEN THE APPS KEEP FREEZING LAG AND CRASH?,,,,,,,,,,
"as Capcut creator, while posting own templates use this template option not showing with my created videos.. plzzzz fix this issue üòî",,,,,,,,,,
I really can't understand why the video doesn't play . It is happening only to me or its app error according to phone model...???,,,,,,,,,,
cool editor I would like to suggest a idea make a effect or a editor that allows you to squish/widen a image/video so I can make funny memes and animations,,,,,,,,,,
Its template search bar not working continuously before a 3 week its show error when I try to used search engine.,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is very good but 1 issue I am facing that when I am enhancing voice,it takes a lot of time please fix it.I am very greatful to you",,,,,,,,,,
"Once upon a time this was the best editting software but in recent months I've notice quite some drastic changes, the app is not only freezing up but most of everything is pro wherein u have to pay to use most of the features .I did pay however the pro feature are still blocked therfore I'm still not able to export my vides. This is such a rip off. I'm extremely disappointed and I need to get reimbursed for the money I paid.",,,,,,,,,,
"this is a great app I have been using it for a long time but the problem about it is that there is this error message I get, when I try to edit my videos it says some footage has been corrupt And I tried everything to get it back but I can't AND I WOULD HAVE TO START ALL THE WAY BACK OVER on my progress and it took days for me to complete and it was annoying So please fix that issue And hopefully when it updates it can be fixed...",,,,,,,,,,
This is a great app! It is useful for multiple purposes and works efficiently...Although sometimes it starts to get laggy and I can't type properly.All in all it is an amazing app and fulfilled it's function.,,,,,,,,,,
"its a good app it helps me work on videos , picture editing i have been working with cupcat for 1month now just littel issues sometimes but thank you cupcat",,,,,,,,,,
Very good best of best never crashes it's a close second to Lightroom but it works very well,,,,,,,,,,
"Importing multiple videos is issue, plz include option inwhich we can import multiple videos at once, i mean 1 complete folder",,,,,,,,,,
Are you aware that CapCut users are experiencing issues with the image quality enhancement feature? There are multiple users sharing their experience on Reddit posts. The image quality process is stationary and idle at 30%. I just bought the pro version and it worked with no issue the first time but then all of a sudden it doesn't work. I looked up solutions and multiple pro users are experiencing this issue.,,,,,,,,,,
"DONT LET THE GOOD COMMENTS FOOL YOU, the app is a pain to edit with, it lags and freezes, it crashes,.and it keeps corrupting my footage so I have to restart over and over again, it's horrible.",,,,,,,,,,
Its a good app ive really enjoyed it but for the last week its been lagging and freezing. Not letting me export any videos which is very annoying especially when i pay for the app. Capcut please fix the errors.,,,,,,,,,,
"It's good if you're just starting out with video editing, but after a while I noticed that whenever I cut out a section of the video, the audio in will be delayed. It is possible to fix, but it is really annoying, and requires extracting, cutting, and moving all the audio to make it in sync. Also whenever I export the video, the actual video is delayed so the audio sometimes happens before it is shown.",,,,,,,,,,
"Everything is fine, everything is perfect but there is a issue which is a lot of glitch in the effect of slow motion. Update your new version after removing all these rugs.",,,,,,,,,,
"Best editing app of all I totally like it.. It's very good for editing, but I don't know y they have to give money to make a template. Iam very good at editing but the template is not good cause I need money to make it, thats y I just gave 4 star cause the other star is for the template, please capcut CEO please see onthis issue",,,,,,,,,,
"Your app was amazing, but now its trashy because of the pro features and the sudden crashes and lag because of templates. I'm not sure why it went from being a completely free, amazing app, to being the stuff that other people's video editing app need. Like pro features, templates, and tiktok?? I used to enjoy this, but now I think I should switch video editors.",,,,,,,,,,
"The best video editor I've used but one fatal flaw, the audio when you process the video becomes desynced. I'll tell you how upset I got when I edited a 10 minute video i worked on for over 2 hrs, just to find out, the audio is delayed by 1 second please fix this issue, it's the only thing I've found that can make or break my want to continue using this app.",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using it for a while but when I import a video and I zoom it in it looks clear and good at first, but suddenly everything becomes pixelated, and it also needs to be updated constantly if you want it to work properly, because if you don't update it, it will lag, freeze and things won't show up when you try to. And I have noticed that some things get changed every now and then. Like their picture or positons, and it gets a bit annoying when you suddenly cant tell where some things are.",,,,,,,,,,
This app has been great for me except there is one major issue. You cannot crop or rotate videos. Those are literally some of the most basic functions that a video editor should have and it doesn't have them. Technically you can crop or rotate the videos but it will just fill in all the cropped out space with black or put a tiny frame inside a big black box when you rotate it. Please fix this.,,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty good app! Have been using it since August 2022 to make my Roblox and Gacha edits, which I quit doing, I'm gonna make them again in January, on my yt channel. I also use it for other things such as editing photos and clips, also to make pfp's for ppl. There's just one problem with this app on my end, though. Whenever I try to import videos that are longer than 3-ish minutes long, it lags and freezes, and takes like 8+ minutes to import fully, sometimes it doesn't import at all. Please fix.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a very good app to use for video editing and tiktok trends. But, why does every time I try to use a template, it always says ""Unknown error"" and ""No internet connection"" despite me having strong connection with our Wi-Fi? I tried to recreate tiktok trends but I can't because of this. EDIT: Your app only works on Mobile Data. But with Wi-Fi, it doesn't work. Please fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
Your app keeps claiming I'm using pro features when I'm not I've even taken screenshots and video evidence that I've deselected said features and it's still claims that I am and it won't let me export,,,,,,,,,,
This used to be a good app untill it suddenly started crashing and wouldn't let me export my videos I've tried everything and still. Capcut please fix this and maybe I will rate it a 5..,,,,,,,,,,
Could have been 5 stars but this is a very good editing app but the problem is my video sometimes freezes and then it takes only to 42% when exporting and it takes a long time to restore so please fix this.thank you,,,,,,,,,,
It's good and very easy to learn how to use but for long videos like after 6 minutes it will crash every time you try to work on the video or export it...I do wish they would fix that,,,,,,,,,,
"App crashes while opening existing project but it doesn't when opening a new project, it crashes, even duplicating the project worsens it, i can't even see the video before crashing. Please fix stupid this bug!!!",,,,,,,,,,
"I really love this app. It is very easy to edit or creat videos. But, i hope you guys develope more and make sure that new users are happy with it. Bcuz, some times it has issues. And make it more easy to edit or creat videos.

"The app recently, keeps lagging, my edits won't play it's just stuck on pause and the screen is blank. Please fix this quickly cause I need that file asap",,,,,,,,,,
It's such a great editing app . But few weeks ago I find some issues in it like videos didn't save after editing. I hope the owner check this issue.,,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love using this app, it used to be functional and easy PLUS fully free. Now i have to screen record my edits JUST to keep using the effects i usually use. Practically everything in the damn app requires capcut pro and its annoying. Do better.",,,,,,,,,,
Capcut is trying it is well done and we created it makes your edition easier and quick but e dey chop data,,,,,,,,,,
"This is probably the easiest editing application for someone like me. But it faces multiple errors. I encountered it lagging and randomly deleting the clip I worked hard for. And also, there's an error I encountered while exporting something. It randomly crashed. Capcut, please fix it. Overall, capcut is a good editing app and the only problem here is the multiple errors.",,,,,,,,,,
"Good apps for editing video or crop photo. But why after i update the new system on my phone, suddenly my capcut can't make a search for any template? Please take an action on this issue~ Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
"CapCut used to be better. WHY DID YOU PUT PRO?! IT IS MAKING PEOPLE SPEND MONEY FOR MORE STUFF THATS BEEN OUT SINCE IT WAS FREE! And it will not let me crop videos! Whenever I try to crop videos, it just exits the edit and goes to the Templates screen! Make it free and I'll reconsider using it again.",,,,,,,,,,
"The best editor app! The only app I trust for my edits for my YouTube channel @MAZE4ever. But there are some issues in this app after latest updates. It crashes alot what usually doesn‚Äôt happens with other apps. For example, yesterday I was editing a video but suddenly it crashed. And capcut takes TOO MUCH storage than before. I really hope you will fix this soon!",,,,,,,,,,
Auto Captions is not working again. I thought it was an issue with my audio or video but i used cleaber audios and all and it was still the same. Please fix this,,,,,,,,,,
"""I really like CapCut, it's my favorite editing app and I always edit with it. I also love it because it doesn't require much effort, just choose the clips and export, it's a great app""",,,,,,,,,,
4 stars but this app is great but the problem isss... It keeps crashing and lagging,,,,,,,,,,
"Now it crashes, it's buggy, and when I export the video the result is blurry",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using CapCut for over 2 years, and I LOVE it! It's much more easier than Computer Editing Software like Premiere Pro. I often edit my PC Videos and Screenshots ON mobile.",,,,,,,,,,
"Please help me, capcut was going well and I was making an edit. Then all of a sudden I couldn't extract vocals from songs again. I couldn't separate the vocals from the instrumentals any longer. The option was just gone. The button for it just disappeared, I've tried updating but to no avail. I ended up delete capcut. I need assistance on this please. When this is done I'll come and give a five start üôè",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, but the play button is so tiny, everytime I press it during the edit, I accidentally click the blank space which fast forwars 10 seconds. Please fix this issue",,,,,,,,,,
I am disappointed because I have seen very good experiences but on my phone it won't let me scroll through templates. Usually on the bottom of your screen it says templates but mine says nothing. Any ideas??,,,,,,,,,,
The app keeps telling me that there's a security issue as I am unable to edit my video anymore,,,,,,,,,,
"Honestly, it was better before the update. The mobile version is alright (or mid). My only problem is that ever since everyone started using capcut, it went from fully free to now having to pay for the ACUALLY good editing tools. I would rather use something else or learn how to make good edits than to waste money on something I can do myself. But, the free items are still pretty good and the only problem is that the templates kind of ruined many editing communities.",,,,,,,,,,
Capcut has been my go to for a while now and I think capcut users can collectively agree that exporting things is very simple and quick. The template feature is great as well leaving many people with ideas for maybe a snap story or TikTok post. Editing is very easy for itself and most buttons are simple to find. If there are any glitches I myself have not experienced them but I can say that it is very helpful to have features that make the app very simple and pleasing to it's users. 10/10,,,,,,,,,,
When i first used capcut i thought it was gonna be like the others but i was suprised with how good it was and iv'e been using it for almost 2 years and it's been good the only issue i have and have been suffering from is when i try to start editing a video that is in really good quality like 4k it kicks me out of the app. Edit: This issue is still happening and has not been fixed(could be a phone problem),,,,,,,,,,
"This app is great although there's alot of glitches going on, like the whole screen is black, freezes or even lag spike like... We know Capcut is great, but please fix this and thx <3",,,,,,,,,,
"The reason why I rated the app two stars is because the app always freeze or lag when you what to go in it or zoom in on your photos or Even try to pick a effect. Sometime I what to edit a video or photo it freeze and even crash and when you apply a lot of animations,track, effects it always lags. So please can you guys fix this issues and make it work properly so that in your next update we will rate you guys a full five star. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,
There is a error in this when i click sign in then it said sign in failed correct this error imediately okiee there is still problem you cannot solve the issue,,,,,,,,,,
"Everytime i export something it lags and freezes , i put a lot of effort on editing but when i export its trash ! This is the worst editing app I ever used",,,,,,,,,,
This is good app so usefully to all numbers quickly and viral on tiktok Star win chance any time and come on CapCut app and editing you're videos. thanks youü•∞,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a decent app, it's just I have a few problems, I was doing some Ai Videos like a Roleplay of me and my friends in School, Prison, and smth like that, but everytime I pressed a button, sometimes it kicks me out and I have to go back in again, it's starting to annoy me. The most annoying part is either that or how you keep on moving the characters on Text-To-Speech Characters, CAN YOU STOP MOVING THEM?? Anyways have a good day.",,,,,,,,,,
Very fun and useful but it loses a star cause pro limits a LOT and uses quite a lot of storage,,,,,,,,,,
"It's great and easy to use! I've been using it many times now and it has been helpful! Especially to school presentation,although i do wish they have a system were you can switch it a rectangular box,you know it's in horizontal position, because when i use capcut the screen is always at a vertical position box",,,,,,,,,,
This app is so amazing. Especially when I want to make a quick funny video or meme. It's super easy to use and I never pay for anything because most of the stuff that you would have to pay for isn't something I'm interested in. I still get cool edits out of this app.,,,,,,,,,,
It was good until the recent update using velocity ruins the whole video and it freezes up,,,,,,,,,,
"app works great, some crashes( most likely because my phone is 2016) so many users, easy and fun!üòé",,,,,,,,,,
"This is very good app, I've been using this since 2020. but, it's just this one thing i hate. because when i exported something, it's super laggy. i barely don't know if it's done exporting or not. and then, there's this thing again. because when i open it, it would back. i hate it when it's like that, i used to love this App before. but then, it doesn't want to export photos anymore. hope you guys can fix my issues, thankyou.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's terrible simply because I have to delete the app then reinstall it, and it still doesn't work on my mobile. It's says I don't have internet connection when I want to use filters or templates or any other feature. On my desktop, I will not run as it says there are compatibility issues. I troubleshoot the app, save the settings, and I works... Until the next day when I open the app and receive the same messages. And to make it worse, I am asked to answer these stupid questions below? Why?",,,,,,,,,,
"This was my favorite editing app, until I updated my android and one UI version. I am on a Samsung s22 and capcut keeps crashing everytime I do specific things, like exporting videos, reversing clips and even doing smooth slow motion. I updated to the latest capcut version and its still not working. I contacted customer support and they kept saying the same thing over and over again. Please fix your app.",,,,,,,,,,
I'mma still use the app but capcut ruined my edit because first some of the it not even on beat and they put my favorite transition and filter on pro like that's no cool please make my favorite filter and transition go on free again I'm so done with your app because something is wrong with animation,,,,,,,,,,
"i like this app, its easy to edit but if i put 178 screenshot it doesnt work. I use the app in a wrong way?",,,,,,,,,,
Video compress when you emwant to quick edit is annoying and time wasting.,,,,,,,,,,
There is this secure thing keep popping on my screen whenever I open capcut I DO NOT like it.. pls fix this,,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is the best. Thanks to the app creator but I regret updating bcos after I updated it, it is hard to import audio. If I click on 'audio' it should take me to sound but it doesn't work well again and KEYFRAME is not functioning again",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know why capcut in my phone (Samsung S23 FE) can't export templated video. Every time I try to export, it always crash for no reason. Please find the bug and fix it immediately, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry but this is so f^^^ing frustrating whenever o try to export an project and its at 99% my screen freezes and it turns gray fix this because this is time wasting, even f""""""ing updating doesn't work",,,,,,,,,,
"Very buggy and almost unusable. The issue's that plague this app won't be fixed by purchasing pro either. If you're gonna spend money on a monthly editor, there are 50 better ones out there. Good enough for a quick and (very) simple mobile edit, but don't spend money on this kids.",,,,,,,,,,
This is the worst editing application that I have experience in my entire life. FR I just waste my time for 3 hrs because the technical issues of the application like ??? [ When I'm start using Premiere Pro for the first time still didn't drain my sanity that much compare to this app -.- ],,,,,,,,,,
"Malware. App crashes, they keep charging my card, and when I try to delete my account, I get an SSL authentication error. If they don't fix it I'll have to cancel my card. I regret ever using this app. Again, pure malware.",,,,,,,,,,
"I'm an old user of this app and recently I've been facing some issues; one of theme and the most critical one for me is when i try to change the thumbnail ""from album"", it crashs. Hopefully you can fix that in the future.",,,,,,,,,,
I love this app this is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è but there is an issue whenever I apply any effect it makes the video slow and suddenly it becomes faster and gets back to normal but where I have applied the effects it becomes slow please fix it üòï,,,,,,,,,,
It's really good I use it to make videos everyday but the problem is when I do a green screen the other one moves by itself. But overall it's a good app with good quality,,,,,,,,,,
Ok so when I first got the app it was super fun and I loved to edit but then after a couple months it glitched and would not let me access my photos. But it would still let me but like only my screen shot photos would be there.,,,,,,,,,,
"The worst editing app, it keeps crashing everytime I'm editing a vid that have 3 minutes duration, it will only export successfully if the video is only less than 1 minute",,,,,,,,,,
"Whenever I try to import a sound from a saved video it doesn't put it in, it also sometimes takes me back to templates even though I didn't touch the button while editing, not happy..",,,,,,,,,,
"app used to work amazingly. Replacing and editing clips completely crashes the app. I've cleared the cache, deleted some videos, nothing is working.",,,,,,,,,,
"As much as i love capcut and the templates but my capcut keeps saying no internet connection but when i log into other apps the internet connection is just fine and my wifi is usually pretty strong, please fix this issue capcut, its been really hard for me edit videos",,,,,,,,,,
Every time I try to use the effects or other functions it shows the bug that no internet connection... it was a remarkable app but that bug spoils the party for me....,,,,,,,,,,
"It's great! Sure some effects are pro but you can just use them without sharing screen record it then crop it in again, capcut so yeah it's a great app! Overall no problems",,,,,,,,,,
"The apo is great to edit, the transitions are greats but I'll need pro to unlock some new transitions for my edits, one problem to me is that it's laggy and buggy, random music playing and screen freezing",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut needs to fix their issues with long videos. Like whenever I try to edit a long video it'll glitch and pause without me pressing a button. Clearly, capcut isn't the best app to edit long videos",,,,,,,,,,
This app is poo it keeps crashing and almost everything cost money don't waste time it used to be so good before all these annoying updates and everything costed money. Every time I try to edit it kicks me out. There are way better editing apps then this 0 stars,,,,,,,,,,
App keeps lagging ang crashing even though I have an iPhone 13 and I've updated it to the latest version of the app. Been having this problem for a week and it's starting to get on my nerves.,,,,,,,,,,
I am facing Exporting issue after last update. I couldn't export more than 1 GB please solve the issue. After all app is good and easy to use,,,,,,,,,,
My capcut is not working every time I open and edit a video it says app not responding please close. please fix this issue . I uninstall and again installed the app but they don't edit 20 mints plus video app close during editing ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ I save 20 mint video it can take 3 hours plus and my all time waste Please fix this issue . 20 mint video taking time 3 hours plus +,,,,,,,,,,
This App is Great you Can Easily Edit by your Self But there's One think The Text Got bug when it Turns into New Text is Just Crashes and Deleted and Another Bug Is Video When I Deleted the Photos It says Deleted Images So I Recover the Photo is Just Still Deleted Image Is Gotten bug But Is Actually Really Good But Fix the Bugs and Crashes It may be Continue Are Stuff Aren't Working anymore BC Identify my Wifi is Ok but is Feels like There's no Wifi he says Well Kinda Reworked Fix the Bugs,,,,,,,,,,
5 stars rating given on August 2023 as this App works perfectly. But unfortunately only 3 stars rating given now November 2023 as this App custom speed (Speed Ramp function) DOESN'T follow my beats setting at all since last few updates and Capcut still unable to identify this issue. Vivo X90,,,,,,,,,,
"Experience was going great until I couldn't export my projects. The app crashes everytime I try. Also, why does this site not sync between app and laptop?",,,,,,,,,,
"I cant login because I keep getting thr error that capcut is for users 13 and older when I'm very much 31. HAHAHA. ive tried logging in through multiple different ways (tiktok, Google, facebook) and it still doesn't work.",,,,,,,,,,
So basically you need capcut pro for most of the editing stuff and it's quite expensive üòî AND you need capcut pro just to save your edit if you don't have capcut pro and use pro editing stuff. And there's almost no non capcut pro stuff so basically it's a waste of your own time. I hope this makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,
The app was working fine but some few days now I'm trying to edit my video it works fine but suddenly it stucks in one frame and does not works I use to edit so many edits on this app but plzz fix this issue I'm having many problems,,,,,,,,,,
I found and issue. Whenever I record with the camera feature and I delete some text. The sound stays but it doesn't appear. It's really annoying and ruins a bit of my video.,,,,,,,,,,
It was good until it came really laggy to the point that it kicks me off the app and every time i Just try to export my edit it Just freezes and kicks me off again so if you can please fix it it's pretty annoying,,,,,,,,,,
"I dont know why my capcut is not running on internet connection after tiktok banned in my country nepal. And how it is related to tiktok, if tiktok was banned in my country why this app isn't working using internet connection it says only no internet connection even my connection is ok. Its a video editing app why it is not working please fix this issue..",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is so damn frustrating.. for the whole day now I've tried making new projects and stuff, Everytime I insert an audio or photo the whole app crashes. This is bs.",,,,,,,,,,
Its nice and quickly to make the videos i want...keep more making templates for us...,,,,,,,,,,
"Very intuitive, easy to use, with great options",,,,,,,,,,
The freeze and lagging needs to be fixed. I can't edit,,,,,,,,,,

worst experience I am unable to export video to TikTok or mobile device kindly fix the issue,,,,,,,,,,
"i cant access to anything because of no internet connection error in this app,not good at all",,,,,,,,,,

"its crashin after seconds, and its really irritating,,",,,,,,,,,,
"I WANT TO GIVE THIS 1 STAR BC ITS HAVE MANY PEOBLEMS FOR FRAME VID,ITS KEEP LAGGING WHEN I WANT TO EDIT THE FRAME AND LIKE ITS CRASH!!!PLSS FIX IT!!!",,,,,,,,,,
I love it but every time I want get sound from YouTube my phone always black screen,,,,,,,,,,
"It crashes way too much, it even does it on my PC so it's not my device",,,,,,,,,,
Slowmo on my video struck on 33% i install this app 3 time in a day but issues is not solving,,,,,,,,,,
Capcut is a fabulous app it is provide many functional tools and filters,,,,,,,,,,
"I LOVE IT SO MUCH! I got so used to this and then I tried alight motion and I was like 'uhhh nope. Capcut is easier :3' just one thing.. Recently when I've been putting the style 'Velocity: flash' it doesn't work! The video is just stuck on one part like, it shows one part of the vid and it freezes :(",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know why the rating is so low, I personally love this app! I haven't found a better video editor than this one. It is easy to use, has intuitive navigation, and works well. There is enough of free functions. The recent captions and auto lyrics functions are a blessing to me. Thanks to the developers!",,,,,,,,,,
"Easy to use, easy to learn, easy to create, and obliterated my expectations. Edit: The new updates are kind of ruining the app new rating 3 stars. I can't even open up the app",,,,,,,,,,
"It would be better if you guys fix the video playback issues, particularly the issue causing fast-forward motion before actual playback during editing would greatly enhance the experience. üòä",,,,,,,,,,
It doesn't function well when I open it it's start to display a white screen.,,,,,,,,,,
"MOST USELESS APP!! Ive been editin in this app for long... But recently not recently i have been suffering for too long.whenever i edit a video whether its 1min or 5 min while editing suddenly it stops working and turns black. i used to refresh my feed and then again do my editings and it used to work but now it turns black and after i complete my edit and export it, i can watch only few seconds of the video then the screen turns black! Uninstalling this app rn!!ü§¨ü§¨",,,,,,,,,,
Poor app. There is an error in search feature. I'm looking for a template but not work !,,,,,,,,,,
So many free functions. Perfect for anyone thats wanting to edit videos,,,,,,,,,,
Lol the update is not good! I can't find fonts originally use. The functions are not it,,,,,,,,,,
"Nice app! But it needs to improve it's slow motion and background removing system! I hope it's developers will solve this issue. Ohh, there is a big problem also, when I take a slow-motion video to capcut for editing the slow-motion video, then I found that video normal, not slo-mo! But when I see that video out from capcut, then I found that video in slo-mo! I think it is a mega problem of capcut! Please fix this problem!üòí",,,,,,,,,,
Since the Samsung update for android 14 (OneUi 6) the app is constantly crashing when exporting or reversing video. I even tried factory reset to no avail. Device is s22 Ultra (exynos).,,,,,,,,,,
"Really solid editor with a lot of features for free and possibilities in editing. Very useful and easy to use. I only have a couple complaints about the UI: Sometimes the grid snap when moving things around (like audio or text) can be quite frustrating and hard to deal with when you're trying to get it just right. Also, on some occasions the preview will bug out, and freeze when you scroll through the video making it temporarily unplayable, thus preventing you from being able to edit further.",,,,,,,,,,
"i genuinely love this app and have been using it since 2018-2019. it has good effects, and i make good edits on it. however, i rated this app 3 stars because the ""smooth"" slow motion is hardly smooth. it is very choppy, and sometimes it looks like it wasn't even applied. i also hate the fact that whenever i try to export a video (even less than 30 seconds), it will crash.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've always used CapCut as my primary editing software. I didn't have many issues with it before up until recently. Every time I use multiple keyframes in one draft, it lags the app out and makes the draft unbearably inaccessible. Every time I enter the project with the keyframes, I keep being pushed out of the app. Even processing doesn't work, and whenever it does, the output isn't as good as the preview BEFORE the lagging. I need this issue fixed because I don't think I can use this anymore.",,,,,,,,,,
The app is good and all I can edit some but the motion blur and the smooth slow mo won't function i tried reaching out to the customer service but they didn't send me any email or something. If they would fix the problem with the motion blur and the smooth slow mo function I would give this app a 5 star. Please fix it as soon as possible or send me an email. I think it's only my device that is experiencing this kind of problem. Thank you!!,,,,,,,,,,
I been having this app for two years now and everytime I make a video and wait a couple months or couple weeks and then go back and look at it some the picture that use just shows up as a black screen and it says something about capcut did something or something close to that. And that is very annoying bc I have to redo the video every time. But overall the app is great and is better than the other editing apps.,,,,,,,,,,
"Fantastic app, great to take your ideas while on the go and quickly make a video out of it. 3/5 bacause while everything about this app is great, the music search function is absolutely atrocious. It's unable to find or sort any locally stored sound or song. The in-app file explorer's search function doesn't work at all, and the songs it can find aren't sorted in any meaningful way (alphabetical or otherwise). Such an integral function should just work, bringing my rating down by 2 stars.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for 2 months and I find it so easy to edit my videos. I like the templates, I like how easy to make things according to my like. So decided to subscribe for 1 month, the pro Subscription. For only a week of using it,things went wrong. It keeps on crashing. I check if there's an update but my version is up to date. And some of text effect like bubbles, title, and etc is not functioning. I don't know why now it is happening. And I don't know what to do to fix this.üò£",,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry for a 1 star review, but I don't really like this app. I installed it to make a YouTube video like other people. I used a black background and put video overlay. I clicked the triangle play button to play the video. Audio was synced with video. I exported it. I then went to power director to finish editing the video, I dragged the video and then noticed. THE CAPCUT VIDEO AUDIO WASN'T EVEN SYNCED WITH THE VIDEO ANYMORE. An audio came earlier than it was supposed to. This would be a good app",,,,,,,,,,
"Powerful free editor. You have a lot of functionality. Still, there are some improvements that I would find them useful. - sometimes exported the videos has glitches. The only solution is to create again the project. - font/animation position is changing from time to time or from version to version making annoying to search what you want in a list of 100+ items. - have a search functionality for font, animation, transition, etc. - search functionality for gif/sticker on giphy or other websites",,,,,,,,,,
"I use mainly for my Youtube Channel, and the video compression is a little annoying because the vast majority of my videos are recorded in 720p but forces over half of them to be 1080p which makes the storage skyrocket, and i don't really have enough storage. The export tends to say ""not enough storage"" when i have a gig in storage or close to a gig in storage space available. If you can, make the video compression only work for videos 1080p and not require 720p videos to be compressed. Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,
"best editing app, and it's completely free! there are a lot of features! we can also remove the watermark by simply deleting it! so it's very amazing. But the problem is.. it lags a lot and the song won't match the video sometimes.. I dropped this to a 2 star because of how much it errors. When i'm editing and want to click 'play video button', it freezes, no matter how many times I click it I can't play the vid, the button is at pause all the time",,,,,,,,,,
"I love capcut, it's very easy to use for effects and such. But could you please make a sort by or search bar button when we're about to import an audio coming from our device? Because it's difficult to import music especially if we have lots of audios on our device. The list is rumbled and it's difficult to find the song we are about to import, it's not even sort atleast in name, i'm having a hard time in that part. Hope you consider this. üò£",,,,,,,,,,
"The apo is great, and the transitions are beautiful! Extremely intuituve and easy to use. However, the audio constantly slowly starts desyncing from the audio file during editing, so I have to keep on saving the project to look at the timing then try and edit said timing while getting no feedback, leaving the smallest of changes needing another export of the video. If that lil audio issue gets fixed, it'd be practically perfect! The issue is just so annoying and disruptive that it docked 2 stars",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app. A lot. It's so easy to use for editing my videos. Also, I'd love to give you 5 star BUT only if you guys can fix the songs to be in order. If you can't make the search button, AT LEAST make it arranged in alphabetical order. Please. It took such a really long time just to find a suitable songs for my videos. Please considere my request. Thank You!",,,,,,,,,,
"Horrible app, for some reason, when I export an edit, some of my clips are just a green screen, so that's fun. I can use an effect and then decide to take it out, and when I export it, it's as if I still have the effect there. It's really frustrating, I tried making copies and uninstalling, but it still happens. The only thing that helped was making it 480p it decreased the duration of the effect. I've come to the conclusion that you can't use 4k clips. It'll just bug out and glitch capcut.",,,,,,,,,,
"As much as I love capcut, I keep having this issue when it comes to editing. Capcut tends to get laggy and slows down everything whenever I put effects, and I have one more problem.. is that when I want to put a new audio that I have save from tiktok, it won't show up no matter how many days it is, it just won't show. It's quite frustrating.", easy to use, and just plainly great. my only issues is when i tween, there's no option to turn off snapping, and after a while it gets really frustrating, trying to place something perfectly, but suddenly it snaps into the center of the screen. apart from that," it's really fantastic and i'd reccomend capcut to everyone.""",,,
"I like this app, to the point that I deleted the video editor app I used before because this is much better. Free transitions, free stickers, and the aesthetics of it that I love. The only thing is when you edit a long video, the video are gone in the layer but keeps playing in the screen and when you put some text, stickers or even an overlay- there is lag on it. There's a bug? All was good, but it keeps lagging. Hope that it may fix. I, we will be looking forward for that. Thanks a lot! ‚ô?
this is a great app! no watermark",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been experiencing long lags/restarting itselfs, i‚Äôve been experiencing annoying things in this app. For example, I edited a video which is for my project and I worked very hard for it I saved it and there it was, I came back and it was gone! It wasn‚Äôt even in my gallery too. It is not because of my phone, storage, wifi/network, so Devs please fix this issue.",,,,,,,,,,
"The app worked well for a while. I was able to edit with no problems at all, but now I'm starting to have a few problems including 1) When using text, the text doesn't go where exactly i want to put, though everywhere else is fine. 2) Syncing with the music gets worse as you cut a video more, making you think that the edited video is on beat when it isnt. 3) Keyframes are very large and restrict me from moving the screen as fast as desired. Edit: It's gotten worse. more bugs, less functionality",,,,,,,,,,
"Definitely one of, if not the best editing apps out there, but for some reason it really struggles to allign things, any time you try to put something on 2 allignments(such as vertical and horizontal center), it refuses to connect and lags just behind it, and then skips over it, making it an extremely tedious task to put something on the center of the screen, this also happens when aligning objects with edges of the screen",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, I use it for my animations, I'd like to report a issue idk if it's a bug but when I try making a animation and insert all the stuff. I get everything done but when I export, everything deletes in the exported video even though it's in the editing spot. Then I have to open a new project, put the clips I want and then the audio from the exported video. Idk how to describe it I'm sorry if it sounds like nonsense but if ya can figure this out, I'd be very grateful, I love this app.",,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best apps to edit videos and photos. But the only reason to give this app a 3 star rating because of some disappointing things. Like, if the video is kind of long, some part of the video freezes. And the main reason is, the STYLE section's 3D ZOOM and 3D ZOOM PRO are not being showed in Android 10s or lower. Capcut should really take some actions to it and give a chance to the editors with low-end phones.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've loved your app and have been using it for probably around 1-2 years. And recently I'll be making a video, export it and make a new project with that exported video. And it'll not be in sync, it'll freeze on random moments and replaying it or deleting the app hasn't worked at all. I hope this will get fixed soon, I really like Capcut and all it's amazing effects and would hate to move apps.",,,,,,,,,,
"When I started using this app, it was great. But after a while, the app started functioning improperly. There's a lot of lag. So even if the timing is right in the app, when you save or export, the timing for your video is off. The new effects and sorting of the effects are really jumbled, they removed a lot of popular effects used for editing, too.",,,,,,,,,,
"I think this is a great app! Only a couple complaints. For one,when you put the slides too close together you can't put a transition. Which makes it hard because when you want a transition on that tiny slide it won't let you. Second, a lot of the times when I try to screen record it it starts lagging a bunch. Maybe it's the app I'm using to screen record but it hasn't done that until now. Overall, ithink it's a great app for beginners like me!",,,,,,,,,,
"I use this app to edit videos all the time and it is really fun to use. It makes editing for starters really useful and the best bit is everything is free! But it always lags and crashes, the text is really glitchy like if you make a typo the word duplicates itself. I don't know why this happens but even unstalling the app doesn't fix the glitches. Please fix the bugs- Alessia",,,,,,,,,,
"Your app is undoubtedly one of the greatest editing apps for phones. However, I have two main issues that constantly bother me:Any text, filters, or effects at the beginning of videos take about a millisecond to start before the actual beginning. This forces me to cut it before I can post it.I consistently encounter problems when centering video text, stickers, and other elements. It's frustratingly laggy, and it takes several tries before I can recenter them.",,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks for the nice and easy layouts for this app. It was great with the templates and all, but one thing is that when the template has slow motion or applying something heavy, it always shows black screen and suddenly my phone black out itself. It was such lame to experience that. maybe just me tho, but so far it was fine. I suggest to make this app has it own storage like how telegram works. Thank You !!",,,,,,,,,,
"okay, so it is a good editing app and has amazing filters. but recently when i try to export a video the results will turn out satured and the exposure will be really high and basically it just ruins my video quality and ive tried to fix it many times but it just keeps on putting filters on my video. and then it lags a lot when i try to press play please fix it im literally begging y'all üòê",,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent and easy to use timeline video editor. Unfortunately I've gotten an update that I cannot use, I press the button in Google Play but it does nothing. The app will not work anymore either, but this is probably just a simple bug that will be fixed soon. Please get the app fixed soon! I know nobody likes troubleshooting, but jeez I was in the middle of video editing and then got an update.. I couldn't use the update button in Google Play and now the app won't let me play videos at allüò≠",,,,,,,,,,
"Auto beats needs fixing. It's not precise most times at all, sometimes it seems as if they're just randomly formed beats. Secondly the motion blur in this app makes the media green. It ruins quality, Third, when moving videos or pictures to a certain size, it take a long while tbh. And finally, the signing up options are not really....there. Suppose I dont have Facebook or Tiktok or maybe I just forgot my password, how am I going to sign up if I'm interested? That's it tho, great app otherwise‚ù?",,,,,,,,,,
"The apps great, I've been using it since 2019, and the only thing I'd say I have a problem with is saving my edit. SOMETIMES this happens, like every 5-6 months it doesnt let me save my edit and a gray screen appears, then closes my edit. I've tried to save it by duplicating it, but that doesnt work. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app everytime this happens. Besides that everything else is great and all works properly as it should. And the quality option is amazing.",,,,,,,,,,
"Good app, easy to use. I personally like it and use it for making my videos, but one problem I've encountered recently is that when I export a video then put it into another project it ruins the video and if I make anything over a minute, it makes the video itself off timed to the normal audio. Now this may just be a personal issue, but I'm not behind on updates at all- it may just be a bug, but it's a bit of a issue.",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this editing app for 5 months, very easy to use and perfect for beginners, here are some bugs that annoy me alot, 1, whenever i reverse a clip, it says that it's deleted! Even if i still have the clip on my gallery! 2, whenever I'm trying to edit, it always freezes the screen and crashes! I tried reopening the app several times, still doesn't work! So i didn't use the app for a day so it can work perfectly. I'm not able to delete projects after updating this app... Please Fix.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's so easy to use for beginners and it's free too! So it's a total win-win! Edit: it started acting up a little (meaning that some of the amazing functions like the filters etc, stopped working because ""there is no internet connection"" when there was a good connection. Even the font changing feature stopped working because of that)",,,,,,,,,,
"The features are amazing, like the transitions, overlays, etc. However, the app is really laggy, and I can't match music to a sound without going all the way back and starting over. Thats my only problem. I can't edit any videos correctly to match music because the video will stop right before where the clip is split/changed. Please fix this issue asap.",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is an amazing app and very easy to master but what I would like to point out is the continuous lag. Whenever I'm editing, it lags like horrible. I need to keep exporting clips to check if they're even on the right time cuts. I've tried switching devices multiples times but its still the same. I thought it might be due to low storage, but even after I factory reseted, still no change. Its very infuriating at times so I hope you can fix that. apart from that minor issue,it's an amazing app.",,,,,,,,,,
"The app was really good before but now it lags all the time, When I try to put an Overlay in, it skips over parts of the video or freezes at certain frames; and most of my videos aren't even that heavy 30s to 1:45 minutes at most, with probably 1-4 overlays/effects ect. Because of this its now unusable for me. I love Capcut, so hopefully this problem can be fixed.",,,,,,,,,,
"It is a really good editing app for mobile, probably the best, in my opinion. Of course, there are some flaws, but it is GREAT. Some things I would like to be fixed in the future are for one: The Glowing Text color error... when I choose a specific color for my glowing text, it turns the color into a less saturated color. Also, I would like to see capcut be a bit less laggy. If the creators of capcut see to this rating, I hope they take the fixes into consideration. THANK YOU CAPCUT.",,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best video editing apps with many options and it has no watermark. The only issue I have with this is that there are times that the video lags while editing. There was also a time I was editing a video and then on the next day, I cannot open the video I was editing and it said it's because of corrupted footage but it doesn't explain further. I also reported this issue but there was no response so hopefully their services improve when it comes to resolving technical issues", amazing editing app, especially for being free, but I do have a slight issue that can make using it aggravating. About 50%-75% of the time I click to use the app, it immediately kicks me out again not even a half a second later," and I've even tried restarting my phone as well as clicking back into it multiple time with no success. I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling it yet because I don't want to risk losing all my edits if it doesn't even work. It's very irritating.""",,,,,
"This app is very good I have been using it for the last three years but the problem is that since it got the new update I am not able to use google templates. And secondly, when I want to make an edit the first picture/video comes on top of the second picture/video. Like a glitch. And thirdly, when I want to fit the scale of any video or picture, then that picture starts looking backwards. And sometimes the video starts to slow down. So, Kindly fix these issues. I shall be very thankful to you.‚ù?
Overall",,,,,,,,,,
"Great app. Can actually remove the water mark. My go to video editing app. Update: now whenever I try to play back my edit, it jumps cuts and freezes making me unable to see my progress unless I have it. This is frustrating Update 3-12-22 reversing and making my edits slower on this new update SUCKS. it took TWO HOURS FOR ME TO JUST REVERSE A A SHORT CLIP. Cap cute what is going on???",,,,,,,,,,
"First, if you accidentally delete your edit, there's no such thing as a ""draft"" or ""previous delete,"" so you'll never get it back (it's annoying and depressing when your 4-hour edit is gone), second, it occasionally crashes and freezes, and third, the text box capacity is so limited that I have to create another text box to extend it... There's more, but for now, this will enough.",,,,,,,,,,
"Its a great editing app. Easy to use, efficient and there's no watermark, only an end card that can easily be removed. But I didn't give it 5 stars for a two reasons. 1. It lags a lot sometimes and sometimes crashes for no reason. 2.It sometimes goes well, then lags and goes off time with the sound then when you fix it, it happens again. If those could just be fixed, this would be 5 stars in my book.",,,,,,,,,,
"Fascinated by the ease of use and all the tremendous options for editing, I began my journey with CapCut. Unfortunately, on 2 occasions I've lost all my footage, I'm now currently working on two separate videos, of which, are constantly freezing and crashing, to the point that I can't even open up my own projects anymore. I've messaged capcut several times with the specifics to my problems; of which, I've yet to get a reply. I literally am forced to stop working on my projects.",,,,,,,,,,
"Have been using the app for a bit over a year now for personal and work projects, honestly one of the best free options on the market. But!! Please!! Please bring back the ""Blur Close"" video effect!! That one was so so handy for endings, not a fan of the only black screen closing options. Unless I can't find it but I've searched the effects a lot since the most recent update.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is so frustrating!! I don't know if I have a non-updated version of the app, but half of the features don't work correctly or just don't appear at all. I'm trying to make a velocity edit, and the splits are not cooperating correctly. So I looked around for the 'auto velocity' feature, and the 'Style' button doesn't even let me click on it! It's incredibly frustrating, and it's even doing it after I uninstalled and reinstalled.",,,,,,,,,,
This app is great for my edits. It has many cool stickers and effects. The best part is that it is free!! And you don't have to have capcut's watermark on your video of you don't want to. The only thing I would suggest would be if there could be more selections for transitions & and effects. Also I don't like how it freezes and glitches at times. Sometimes I have to export the video to my gallery just to see how it's turning out because I can't see it when it plays up. But I love it overall.,,,,,,,,,,
"I LOVE CAPCUT. It's a very useful editing app from beginners to professionals. It's very simple to use, but I hope they make cool stuff easier to use. Like the triple screen mirror videos. Since there's no option for it, people have to improvise making it much harder. There is also a problem with some videos. In the middle of editing your video the whole screen goes black and you have to scrap the video. I would love for this to be fixed if all of this is done, capcut is the greatest app of all.",,,,,,,,,,
"If I'm being completely honest I wish I could give it 6 stars!! Its so easy to figure out, you're able to remove the watermark, overlay, use all of the animation styles, FOR FREE!!! the only problem is when you split a video it doesnt work corrects but that's just a small bug and can be fixed by exiting out and going back in really quickly! I love it so much!!!",,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty good for the most part. Very easy to learn and use. Very good for beginner editors. Though I wish they'd fix the bug where clips or pictures become glitched out and green when the edits get lengthy (I usually have issues with 25-30 seconds long). It either occurs with too many clips, longer clips, or too many transitions and effects. But if you don't mind exiting the app every little while, it's a relatively good app.",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this since like 2019 after switching from Kinemaster and this is definitely my go-to for editing or making random videos. Recently however, there was an update and my capcut has been glitching like crazy. Whether the image is regular or an overlay, it keeps blinking in the background and even covering itself with the same image! It's super annoying, especially when making edits that require a lot of overlaying, animations, images, and effects. Please fix this!",,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing app overall, just some small errors that need sorting. On certain images if I click on it, it will extend one image for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Also if I click on images it takes me to the end and making it not possible to edit. I have pictures with a friend who lives on the the otherside of the world and I want to have an edit of memories with him but I can't use this app if it doesn't work properly. Just those errors need fixing then it would be a truly amazing app and I'd be very happy",,,,,,,,,,
"It's great! I've been using this app since 2020 and only till now where there some issues. For example I'm editing a voice over for my friend and usually when I would move clips of audio it's smooth and doesn't buffer,however that's changed since the new update. Things automatically delete,even the slightest movement makes everything buffer,now with the new update it's hard to find the effects I need,I thought this was a free app but now you have to buy a monthly pass to unlock effects(?)",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is a great editing app overall. It's easy for begginers and their app is not confusing at all to use but I do have some cons for this app. First their app lags for no reason at all. This has happened to me a lot and I still don't know how to fix it. I have switched phone but it still lags. Second, their helping guide in aligning texts and pictures are very annoying somethimes. Because sometimes I don't really need it but it keeps bouncing back and their alignments in sometimes inaccurate.",,,,,,,,,,
"this app was good at first! but i realized it's hard to do things such as blur some parts or lack of effects. if you want a decent editing app, this is the go to! its good that its free and doesn't have watermark, but i have issues in navigating the diff. things i use in editing, like the text & overlay for example. idk if it just my phone, but when you split it, it doesn't go smoothly and you can tell where was the split cuz of the sounds of that video, is lagging. hope it'll be fixed later.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app is an overall good and effective app to edit on. However, the new update completely butchered the app making it difficult to edit texts. I suggest you change this so that we are able to see our text and what we wrote. Another annoying issue is that the app limits where I can move the text. The text has to be according to their lengths. It would be an even better app if I could move the text anywhere without the text pausing.",,,,,,,,,,
This app is just great! I use my recorder or take screenshots for a video then it auto maticually enters it! You have a free choice of animations effects and stuff you can crop it and all kind of things like that! It doesnt even take up to much storage. I always make youtube videos with this. But the only problem is when i try to look back at a video it deletes it and makes the screen black but other than that its a perfect app for editing making video etc.,,,,,,,,,,
"I totally love this app, tons of transitions, overlays, and more editing tools for free, and there's no certain limit for the clip, I love this app very much but I have only one problem with it, it is so BUGGY! Whenever I try to edit a long video, it will either freeze or the timeline won't move. I don't understand why? CapCut is a great editing app, But I feel like it's getting worser and worser. I don't know if it's about my storage but I can't edit if this continues, Please fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"At first I was really in love with this editing app, I've used this for months now but for some reason everytime I edit a video it always lags, I didn't really mind it. But then I started to use it again all the animations, stickers, text fonts are all just a black screen I can't see any of the transitions and stuff! I tried to uninstall it and install it again but it's still the same! I use a Vivo Y11 and I hope you guys find a way to fix this. Thank you...",,,,,,,,,,
"it's an amazing app !! all those choices transitions, animations and effect all for free is an amazing deal. i appreciate this app so much cause it's the best I've came across, thank you for creating this !! however, recently all the choices for transitions, animations, filters and basically everything seem to not be working for me. i reinstalled it for plenty of times yet it's not being fixed. Please fix this issue, i really love this app and want to have it work properly for me. Thank you !!",,,,,,,,,,
"Ok so c Capcut is a great editing app. I love the effects and the amount of stuff that you can do with it. But I have a very annoying issue, Every time I try to move an effect or overlay or clip, It glitches and moves somewhere else. If I want to fix it, I have to leave restart the app, I don't want to restart my app 20 times because of one edit.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app because I have tried so many other ones that required you to pay for the general editing. The only problem I have is the text. Sometimes, when I'm texting fast it lags, but I understand that. Most apps do that. However, when I click the effects for the text, the text stays plain and white. I close apps, even shut off my phone. I am SO annoyed at this. I am just a normal youtube that edits the same day I post please fix this, or at least help me.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app enough to give it 5 stars, except for one major issue. I used this app just a few days ago to make an animatic style video and it was perfect. But since the new update, images being able to snap to a set position on the sides of the screen has been removed. This is a travesty for me because now if I want to have two frames of an animatic in the exact same spot so they can look like a clean movement, I can't do it on the top, bottom, or sides of the screen. PLEASE FIX THIS.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app! I've been using it ever since it came out, but... I do have some issues with it.. sometimes I try to animate and I have the perfect spot for a piece of the animation ( a picture ) and well, it just gets repositioned.. I would really love if you fixed this. Thanks! üòÅMaybe you could fix it like alight motion?? Maybe not.. I'm so sorry for camparing you to a different app.",,,,,,,,,,
The app is very good. I didn't face any export problem. Or any other kind of lag issue ever using this app. But there is just only 1 reason for the 2 star review. Whenever i open a screen recording clip. The sound just desync. I dont know why. I also tried to extract the audio and sync with the video. And it worked for some time. But 1 day this problem got very worse. Now i cant even sync the audio. Sometimes the audio is playing before and sometimes after. I dont know what to do. Please fix it.,,,,,,,,,,
"I like the app but the problem is there hasn't fast forward or start to end button if you want to go either side. I wish it will be updated with such feature and with the duration option so that it will be easier to expand clip or picture to how long an editor want it to. I hope you'll be able to notice my suggestion. Thank you and more power, God bless!",,,,,,,,,,
I love this app it has allowed me to make some really cool stuff for tik tok but it has some issues from time to time as an example I can't import all of my tik tok sounds for some reason I'm assuming it's a bug but other than that it's great. I would love to see a version of this app for my laptop then I could make some awesome YouTube videos and actually have the storage space for it.,,,,,,,,,,
"It was glitching out when I was trying to make photos stay for less than a second after I do that it makes the next image I click on go on forever. When I delete that image to try again, the video plays even though the video is paused. When I click off the project and come back it shows the images, but not at the top, it just has the ending screen. It's impossible to work on this phone, but I can get it to work just fine with no issues on other devices. Please fix this I will be ok reinstalling.",,,,,,,,,,
"I‚Äôve been using this app for some time now, and I can say it‚Äôs the best in its category. With its free cool transitions and video effects, this app does a decent job taking your mobile video editing to a whole new level. Sometimes, it could glitch and crash. You can remedy that by ensuring you have enough memory/storage space. Aside that, it‚Äôs cool.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for around 8 months (a year maybe), I love every feature, all of it, however since the last update, when I'm editing the video it doesn't run as smoothly as before and sometimes the video freezes even though the app is running. When I import it, everything's perfect but it's so annoying when I'm editing, please fix this, I will appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a great app with great features, though some recent updates have messed with the consistency of how good it is. Three or four updates ago I could not use effects without it turning into a rave with the screen flashing very fast. It got fixed in the next update, thanks for that, but in this new update, I can't even open up Capcut to see what's new. Still very useful, but not useful when it doesn't work.",,,,,,,,,,
"Would have given 5 stars if there wasn't this issue. It has the option to use tiktok sounds and I love this feature. Problem is that I have my account connected, but the sounds aren't the sounds that I actually have saved on my account. When I save a new audio it doesn't transfer to CapCut under saved. Also when I use the sound in editing it cuts off the last few seconds. I would use this feature more if it wasn't as buggy. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,
"i love using capcut to edit videos for tiktok! it's a pretty easy app to learn and it's so cool. i do wish there were more transitions and text effects, though. my main problem is that sometimes when i use smooth slow mo, it changes the color of the clip. it usually gets darker or lighter. it looks really weird. it only happens sometimes. however, it always happens to every clip when i reverse it. whenever i reverse a clip, the lighting/coloring changes. please fix this. keeps crashing!!",,,,,,,,,,
"I'm tired of having to use up all of my space trying to make one video. First I can make my green screen part perfectly fine, I can even export it. I can even put it on top of videos. But when I look at the video the green screen part either skips some things I worked hard on. Or one part will start over and over again. It's making me frustrated, and if I can't use this app then I might as well use alight motion. Fix this problem, I really love the app. I make all of my videos on it.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app and it is great for making movies and is very user-friendly. However, in my movie when two black bars on the side showed up it was playing some scene in the movie and it went from black to that scene over and over again and it really bugs me. And whenever I hit fullscreen and try to rewind or fast-forward it takes me to the scene I was just at and I have to scroll through every frame and it takes FOREVER. So can you please fix those glitches please and thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a very good editing app and has proven superior to many others. However one issue i am experiencing is terrible lag. To the point where my whole video stops rolling for about 5 seconds. It makes things incredibly difficuly. Also a suggestion i have is a moving crop? So for example lets say i have a video but there is an object in that video i want to focus on. Maybe give an option for the crop to move and focus on the object i need it on. But yeah overall really good app, just laggy",,,,,,,,,,
Easy to use than alight motion and also not confusing. The only problem is that sometimes i crash and lag so much that sometimes my phone just freeze for a few minutes. I hope you can fix this and also this is a good app to edit and do something and you can draw here too! But its kinda hard to draw in there but its still good! Anyway sorry if my Grammar sucks. I hope y'all have a great day!,,,,,,,,,,
"Great editing and video making app, except I have two problems. The first is that it gets extremely laggy after putting in over a dozen videos/screenshots and I lose the ability to finish the project quickly. The second problem is that I cannot use the text animation feature because I says I'm not connected to the Internet. I know for a fact that I am because I can use other features that need Internet that work perfectly fine. Please fix those problems. But overall, the app is decent.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, in my opinion it is the best editing app. one small issue, there is a problem with trimming your gif/video, and it's about the start time. if you split or trim a gif to change its start time, it will not work, and there is no use for it. please fix this. otherwise I really love this app and have no other issues. I've tried many other editing apps bit tjis is the best one ever. favorite editing app, if the trimming/spitting issue didn't exist I would've given it 5 stars.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's mostly great, useful features & easy to use. But the main issue I have with it is that whenever you try to drag anything on the screen (video/image, sticker, text) it locks up & clicks to the most RANDOM places & it's very difficult to get the placement of things how I want it bc of that. So that's very frustrating. Hopefully you'll fix this sooner than later. One more thing, I wish there were settings for notifications in the app so you can turn off certain notifs, but keep others on.",,,,,,,,,,
"I can definitely say that CapCut is the best mobile video editor app for 2020. The effects, transitions, and filters included in this app are so good! Meanwhile, I just noticed that the provided sound effects are quite limited. I suggest that CapCut should have bigger music library. Overall, Capcut still deserved to have my 5-star review because this app truly exceeded my expectations about mobile video editing apps. I am looking forward for your newest version! Two thumbs up for you, Capcut!",,,,,,,,,,
"The app is great for editing and easy to use. However, I have recently experienced bugs in the app while editing. The app kept crashing, lagging, and unexpectedly closing while I was editing. I tried all kinds of remedies, clearing the cache, restarting both the app and phone, deleting unused videos and files, but none worked.",,,,,,,,,,
"Awsome app!! This app will catch up a beginners edit. Even though there's many bugs I still like this appüòä. But the bug it's, I was editing debates or 1v1 or something, and I was puting text shake with green screens, when I was puting the overlay it has a lot of bugs, like my overlay kinda... Blured or something, and looks even fat than than the regular one, and if I edit to much animations/too much time, it will absolutely lag for no reason! Can you guys fix this?",,,,,,,,,,
"This is more frustrating than before, when in the middle of making another long edits, it keeps crashing and I try to restart my phone and do some edits it wouldn't work, it's goddamn stupid waste of time, yes I put it in one star because of the bugs are interrupting my edits as always, but I will change it if another update coming soon and the bug will be fixed as long as they can. Yeah that's all I can say",,,,,,,,,,
"The app is great for editing videos and other things but I have an issue where when I try using a font or anything that requires internet, it says there isn't any connection even though I am connected to the Wi-Fi, I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it still shows no connection. It's getting really annoying to edit videos, I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but maybe there's something that can be done about this, still an amazing app though.",,,,,,,,,,
"The best mobile editing app in my opinion. But there are few bugs in the app that bother me when I'm editing. Like when I cut the clip in half the background music is cut for some reason. And I get a gap of music in the middle of my edit. But after I save it, the gap isn't there. This really ruins my vibe and my editing confidence, as I make beat synced videos.",,,,,,,,,,
"I find this app brilliant! It's easy to use and simple to find things yet you can still produce brilliant edits. The only reason the last star isnt there is because I think there should be an option to turn off snapping to a point, like snapping to 0 in angles or snapping to the centre of the screen as it can get rlly annoying when using key frames",,,,,,,,,,
For the almost two years I've been using this app it's been a amazing but I need help. I try to make an edit but then when I cut a video to get a clip j need the beginning of the clip freezes and it's not worth using anymore and even when I try to get a different clip it still doesn't work and try to clear storage but theres just something wrong please fix it. It's so frustrating,,,,,,,,,,
"I kinda like Capcut for awhile now, like for 1 year or 2, since it's easy to edit with, but after my phone update, and coming back to the app whenever I open it, the app crashes then closes always. MAYBE the app can't handle the update of my phone, or it's just my storage. Pls help me fix this. I need to get my projects back without deleting them or the app itself. The app will always crash whenever I go in now. Just update the app or whatever.",,,,,,,,,,
"It a great app, been using it a while. The only annoying thing is that, before the last update, you were able to center the text without barely moving it across the screen; now it takes a lot of work and precision to be able to center it, I don't know why you decided to change it but it's annoying and it's a waste of time trying to center every single thing you write. Hope you can change it to the way it was before.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's an incredible app. Easy to use, works well and minimum lag. But for some reason the app keeps on being unable to open out of nowhere sometimes and it's extremely frustrating, then the only way to get it back is reinstalling the app but it sucks because then everything you have is gone. Respectfully I would really appreciate the developers of capcut to fix the issue. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a reliable video editor but this app has caused me some problems which need to be fixed. First, whenever I make videos that are 1 mins or more, CapCut freezes when I try to put in texts for subtitles or overlays. This then effects the preview of the video. I did some of this before but it is just getting worse. And secondly, unexpected lags which then caused my to get kicked out of the app. Can you please sort this out?",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love this app but now it's awful to use. Putting any kind of text is a hassle, before hand it was simple and easy no issues. But once the update happend back in January it's not usable. So what the deal is, is that when you go to put text on your video it not only zooms in so that you can't see where the txt is in relation to the video but if you type a short word the text just up and vanishes and its like you never put text on it at all. This bug needs to be fixed.",,,,,,,,,,
"Why does one time when you do an effect allow you to choose a speed, but the next time you don't let it go? This greatly interferes with the installation of video, and the transition comes out very fast and ugly, since it allows you to choose a speed of only one second! Please fix it. Without this flaw, the pragram is good, convenient and can quickly understand how to use this program",,,,,,,,,,
"üíï My favorite editing app. Amazing. Only a few notes: far too many ""premium only"" features, which recently just popped up, so it's about of a shock Tomy system,. Too much pandering to TikTok, and not the cutting edge trends nor quality in regards to TikTok. Can't stand that the main slot requires a video. What if I don't want a video there? What if I just wanna export audio? And last, dragging and dropping is not precise and not possible when choosing to bring a main video down to overlay area.",,,,,,,,,,
"I haven't gotten pro mode yet but I'm seriously considering it... it seemed like just other day I was able to do everything for free but maybe I'm confused. Anyway, besides the fact it takes getting used to and doesn't have the easiest UI.. it's great once you can figure it all out. It's not very intuitive and kind of annoying but it does a lot of stuff for a phone app.",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love capcut. It was the only editing app without a ""pro"" version, and the smooth slow motion was actually good. But now, ever since the pro version capcut has been so much more laggier. The smooth, slow motion doesn't work. It's laggier than how the clip was before. When I press the background, it lags and crashes. Another annoying thing is that if you have velocity or smooth slow motion on, you can't reverse. And please, please fix the choppy velocity. I am not hating. It bugs me.",,,,,,,,,,
"Many bugs in the new update! The video I am editing shows only black screen, and the app keeps crashing.",,,,,,,,,,
"If the video you create doesn't lag as it plays, then it could be a major improvement to me. I also want to point out that the app sometimes resets certain animations and I have to redo them again, along with the video qualities becoming worse when I import my own. Aside from the other issues, I CapCut is alright to use.",,,,,,,,,,
"I just think it's unfair , most transitions are pro and people can't use them . I think we should make some of them not pro , like literally unfair . Other than that , it's quite a good editing app.",,,,,,,,,,
"Fantastic app. I went Pro. LOVE IT. Only thing imho that needs more attention is a good search function for stickers, gifs, tunes.. 4 stars because it lacks that. But finding my way and being creative. Android, older Sony Xperia user. Tip: if the app seems slow when editing you might want to create more available memory on your phone (or tablet) and also work in bits that you can merge later.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a good editing app i may say, though it's not the best, but it is a good app. Why I'd given it a 4 star rating is because there are some problems, bugs, glitches, etc. And probably most known bug or glitch is that on random times whenever ur editing or doing something, the screen turns white and you will have no choice but to go back to ur home screen and start the app and sometime it may not save ur project/what you we're editing until the screen turned white. There's more, but that's all!",,,,,,,,,,
It freezes when I edit in an hour. Fix it please. It's really annoying.,,,,,,,,,,
"The way I started to legit hate this app because of how it has changed to a premium necessity. It is horrifying. Editing isn't easy, and it can take several hours if not days, (I am a professional editor), and not everyone can get premium. So when the app RUINS the video you put so much effort in... I wish I could give less than one star!",,,,,,,,,,
It requires more space in mobile otherwise it will cause mobile hanging .. overall it's good 3/5,,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app so much, but when I'm making an edit that has more than 1 effect or a lot of transitions, it makes the video lag a lot. When I export it, I find that the video isn't quite how it showed. Itll be off beat or the effects wont show up in certain places. Other than that, I would definitely reccomend.",,,,,,,,,,
"I really like this app! But there's one problem... when I get inside the app, and go to the template page, the app crashes. I want to go to the video page (the videos that you created),it crashes again, and again, and again, and again, and again.I did'nt rate it 5 stars because the app keep crashing whatever i get inside. Please fix this..",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this app since last year. But there have been a glitch on this app on my phone for days. The style button has gone. I can't find the style option. And also, if I try to a smooth slow motion, it does not come smooth. Plz solve this glitches. Plz plz plz fix it. And plz can we get a new feature that allows us to separate the vocals, instrumentals of the song that we extracted from a video. Plz fix this issue and bring my style option BACK!! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",,,,,,,,,,
"This app was an easy 5 star all day for video editing but the recent 12/8/22 update completely ruined the text editing. Can no longer update the formatting of all the captions, editing text or captions is now impossible without the popup text box above the keyboard. If these are fixed/reverted it's definitely back up to a 5 for me. P.S. Allowing the user select the the text size before autocaption splits it up would be HUGE!",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using CapCut for a few years, but about a month ago this annoying glitch started. I would export a video and it would freeze in one frame for a bit and then continue and freeze again. This glitch started to become a problem, so I uninstalled the application and reinstalled it again. It did nothing. I know this isn't my phone because I installed CapCut on my computer and the same glitch happened. I'm not sure what this is or why it's happening, but please try to fix it. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app! It's great if you want a free, easy to use, watermark free app, and has many accessible features for all devices! The only thing I would reccomend is a toggle button on the snap grid, when editing it can sometimes be annoying, and hard to position things that are slightly off centre. Other than that, great app!",,,,,,,,,,
So far it has been the best app ever best editing app. Specially it's very easy to use you can make videos very quickly won't take much time with this app it's the best editing app. Has too many best editing features without Pro subscription. Cool editing features good filters and a huge music library with every kind of music what else do you need to make a pro video. Yeah but of course there is one issue that I am facing. I am just unable to trim music so to trim music I have to go on Google.,,,,,,,,,,
"It's good but has clear issues. The first is a pretty major flaw with the app and its that not only do some clips just straight up break in the app, showing glitched out varients similar to a broken LCD but also can break in exports which makes it frustrating to use since there's no clear fix. The second is that a lot of things are locked behind the subscription, which is fine if its all new but some of it is old stuff that doesn't even have the pro mark but still locked behind the subscription.",,,,,,,,,,
I give it a five star because it helps with my edits and it works very well and it never has any issues,,,,,,,,,,
"It was a good editing app until now. I used to edit here occasionally but NOW it's impossible. Everytime I playback my edit, the video constantly FREEZES on a random cut, and then shortly speeds up to catch up with the audio. It frustrates me a lot, because I can't even see how the final video will look like! I can't sync the video with audio because of this stupid lag glitch.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love using capcut, it's very simple and easy. However I have a problem revolving around the text, Whenever i type a sentence, the quality of the text is terrible, it looks sorta glitchy and before the text wasn't like that could you help me please? It's hard to not notice it and it messes up my edits. This has happened to my sister's as well please fix this issue",,,,,,,,,,
"I love the app, it helps a lot when I'm trying to edit videos. although, I have use a lot of pro effects and I can never export! Almost everytime the good effects are pro!! Please get rid of pro. And also, the ""remove background"" button doesn't work it gets rid of the person im using. Please fix that! Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
This app is the best editing app. Easy to use and clear UI I really love it... But since I updated it got so many bugs. When I save a video into my gallery it's just freeze But I still can hear the sounds tho. It's Only the video that is freezing. But there is nothing buggy about this app just the video freezing when I saved it to my gallery. Can you pls fix this app plsssss üòÑüòÅ,,,,,,,,,,
"im going to give this a 4/5 rating because it honestly is more robust, reliable, and capable app. there is a massive setback. I make YouTube Videos frequently & I recently discovered the Auto Caption function. which is awesome... but... the auto captions cut off the last letter of each line. editing text is a nightmare. I maybe get a chance to edit text every 5 min every 10min because it stalls out quickly on my device. Love the App. but will use YouCut for Video Text other than Auto Caption.",,,,,,,,,,
"Seems like a good app at first, but it doesn't let you select or search for videos from your own android albums or categories which is frustrating. It makes you search for videos one by one. I like FilmMaker better, because it let's you find the exact video you need quickly whereas CapCut makes it difficult and tedious. I uninstalled this app.",,,,,,,,,,
I was about to give 5 stars but I only give one because everytime I move an imagine or layer video or auido or a text it will move by themselves which is annoying and you haven't fixed the new glitch please fix the new glitch I hope you understand ü•π,,,,,,,,,,
My first time in here is good almost good as everything but that thing changed as I open it and theres no button on the bottom theres no template and all that so plss can u fix it up....,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the new update I have trouble logging in my account, the error says ""couldn't sign in try again later"" or when I try to use a template from tiktok it says somethings wrong with my network connection even tho the connection is perfectly fineüíÄ",,,,,,,,,,
Awful customer service. I've got an audio sync issue that only happens on videos recorded with my blue yeti mic. It started a few months ago & was fixed by a previous update but now it's back. So updates are turning it on & off & it only affects certain videos. It's a software bug. I sent them multiple video/draft examples and provided dates of when the issue was fixed & when it came back. They ignored all of that & once again told me to clear my cache. Just disrespectful. I'm done with this app,,,,,,,,,,
"Loved this app and its insane reputation, used capcut since it came out, but even the greatest can fall. Full of bugs and small errors many dont notice, popups are EVERYWHERE!! ever since templates came out capcut has turned to poop. Lag, glitches,bugs, and stuff popping up every second begging for me to buy pro, like fk off.",,,,,,,,,,
"Unintuitive, busy, slopped together feel. I could not make a 14-second video of my cat jumping out of a box, the kind of video I've done numerous times with my phone and another video editor whose name escapes me. I have no idea who's writing positive reviews, I don't think they have experience with a video editor OR they're hoping to make some really weird stuff. Uninstalling. ü§° üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏èüë∫ üëΩ Happy Halloween ghouls and boyzs .",,,,,,,,,,
Recently i couldn't export my projects because it keeps crashing and i don't know what to do so please fix it fast!,,,,,,,,,,
nice to edit with however sometimes it can be quite slow and glichy at times. I don't necessarily like the idea of the templates. I feel like they're taking away the value of an edit that someone spent actual time on and replacing it with zero effort edits that turn out great. and all of the AI stuff NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. I feel the same about AI that I do the templates. it's taking away all of the effort that some person put into it.,,,,,,,,,,
Not open üòû give security issues why???üòï l am using from play store how to solve it üôÇ,,,,,,,,,,
"This is probably by far my favorite editing app, I would've given it a 5 star if it weren't for the immense amount of bugs... A lot of times I'll be trimming an image, and the tracking will be really off. I don't know how to explain it, but basically I'll click the edit button on one image, and it'll select the one next to it. It would be really nice if this were fixed. :) Other than that, it's a really good editing app.",,,,,,,,,,
"The Best App I have... But I wish that y'all could fix the lagginess of this app while we're editing... Cuz everytime I edit, it becomes ugly due to the lagginess of this... I really love this app so much, I could not ever find a replacement for this. And also I don't know if I'm the only one but... Sometimes I can't click some Effects and will freeze the whole thing on my screen and smtms when I make the speed of the music into slowed version for my channel, the voice becomes glitchy:((",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love using this app but now, it's kinda annoying. Everytime I try to shorten a clip it makes it's like 45 minutes long!! Then it lags non-stop now. Please fix this, I will have to delete it soon if this issue is not fixed. It has also been saying there is connection problems when the connection is completely fine. Please fix this. I will give 5 star review if this is fixed.",,,,,,,,,,
"I would give it a 5 star but the current update make the app annoying the compressing thing takes a lot of time..more than a hour if it's 10 or 20 min video even if you crop it , it takes 10 to 15 min compressing 2 3 min video. I hope developers fix this issues.",,,,,,,,,,
"I would have given this app a 5-star, but it gets really laggy sometimes, or maybe it gets fully frozen and when I try to reset it still freezes and after a long time it works- Don't get me wrong, this is a great editing appü§© but... You have to purchase to get the cool stuff, so it would be better if free. I LOVE THE APP EITHER WAY.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for a very long time in my mobile phone and i was satisfied with it, then i decided to switch to windows version and so far it's been the worst experience, every video needs to be edited multiple times, everytime, a green screen appears after saving the video, it's such a hassle for someone who waits for hours to see the outcome, please do something about these errors! why does it keep happening?",,,,,,,,,,
"I oiss using this app for around 8 months (a year maybe), I love every feature, all of it, however since the last update, when I'm editing the video it doesn't run as smoothly as before and sometimes the video freezes even though the app is running. When I import it, everything's perfect but it's so annoying when I'm editing, please fix this, I will appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's a good editing app but the newer versions aren't working. It keeps giving me the ""no internet connection"" error which doesn't make sense since i have a good internet connection plus using a vpn also doesn't fix the issue. I've written emails and actually did whatever they told me to do but none of it worked. I can't even send feedbacks in the app due to this issue. I'm currently using the 5.6.0 version of it which is very old i need this to be fixed immediately but they keep ignoring.",,,,,,,,,,
I love this app. Every edit I make always improves and I always descover new things. I have a few issues.First: I do an edit with text in it and after I export it some of the text shrink from the size I did please fix it. Second: I do an edit with photos in it and when Im done and put it as draft I go the next day and press on the video and it tells me (for some of the photos) that I deleted the photo or that it got removed from my phone. Which is not true at all. Pls fix it!,,,,,,,,,,
"it's kind of horrible. It has plenty of options and cool features but the app doesn't really work. The app often crashes, random clips will glitch out and not work, the clips will freeze while the music plays and there's no way to stop it. The pause/play button only works sometimes along with the app generally being pretty slow.",,,,,,,,,,
"I don't have any issue with this app.. it gives me all I want.. For me, it's better, easier and cheaper to use than window softwares.. the outcome remains professional..",,,,,,,,,,
"I've started using this early this year and this is the best video editing app so far. The effects, multiple overlays and audio options perfectly fit my needs. The only thing is that misaligning/synch issues I get after the update last Oct/21, though I can still manage it with a lot of patience. But overall, it's the best one for me.",,,,,,,,,,
"this was the only app i could make my edits with and now the smooth slow motion doesn't work anymore? idk if it's my phone or not but it's been like this for days, it's frustrating tbh. plus now everything is capcut pro and crashes/lags A LOT. idk y'all ruined itttt...",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut, please fix your goddamn glitch when I edit a 5-hour video and it crashes like the footage files are corrupted when I restart my phone after I open it. I worked hours like hell in my room just for this video, and In the end, it was just a waste of time. I didn't slept for making this video. I am so angry and tired. Some people are experiencing this glitch and wondering how to fix it, but there are no solutions to come up with. My phone works fine and stable and your app is hell.",,,,,,,,,,
"The only reason I've given it 3 stars is because it's super buggy. It lags a lot and the playback is delayed if there are lots of media files in the clip. Another bug I've experienced is inability to select 3D Zoom instantly without selecting 3D Zoom Pro first and cancelling it. And for the most annoying bug, my entire phone freezes while exporting the video so every time I want to export a video, I have to forcibly reboot my phone and then export it. Fix these and you get 5 stars from me!",,,,,,,,,,
"Just like a real editing software, it crashes all the time! Yay!",,,,,,,,,,
"Right, this is a good app an all. BUT once you get to a certain amount of screenshots or pictures it lags so much. It's irritating! I'd be trying to edit something and it would mute the sound randomly or do the complete opposite of what I tried to do, like I tried to make the picture go for longer and it just went shorter.",,,,,,,,,,
"Very nice but it can be very laggy. And I tried to use a template but it always shows ""templates will appear here"" but they never do. It's stupid. Another thing I hate is when your moving a overlay there is like a wall so it doesn't let me move exactly where I want it. Effects are nice but they make the video so laggy for no reason. And if you wanna use a sound you have to extract is from your camera roll which takes up lots and lots of space if you do edits a lot. So I like it but theres issues",,,,,,,,,,
"I cant export videos,audio,photos in my edit video, I try fixing it but it won't work,also can't export the video template Please fix this problem,this happen wheni installed ui 6",,,,,,,,,,
Capcut was perfect then the moment the update that changed exposure to brilliance and sound Effect to FX happened everything is just ruined üò≠üò≠üò≠ please I want to go back to exactly before that update. 3 stars cause I used to love the app but 1 star for the current reality,,,,,,,,,,
it was so fun and good at first. then I wanted to make a very simple video edit and nothing would stay where I wanted it and the video kept speeding up and slowing on its own. I couldn't fix the speed issues because it said everything was normal. So much potential that went to absolute garbage if you're not using a template,,,,,,,,,,
"I gave it a three because every time I try and put screenshots together it brings me to the end where you know it puts like the transition for the app at the end? Anyway, I press on it and it makes the video longer than needed and makes it like 64 minutes at the highest for me and 34 at the lowest. And I have to press undo I have tried to see what what wrong but I have no clue! I have reinstalled the app multiple times only for it to get worse and not letting me export the video. It's annoying",,,,,,,,,,
"Great app for using English, but not so great when using other languages. It completely messes up when you type in Perso/Arabic script. It is such a shame coz so many people use it but can benefit from the text option in those languages. Great app tho. Just not compatible. Really hope they fix the issue. It types in reverse and scrambled order when you use Farsi for example. FIX IT PLEASE.",,,,,,,,,,
"Update: the app barely works anymore & they've done nothing to fix it. I have the paid version. Haven't been able to make a video, keeps freezing mid project & such a waste of time, who do we contact? Update: Getting more and more disappointed with this app, which I paid for. December update, this app still is not functioning properly, very difficult to edit, freezes, can't view edits when shortening clips. What's going on here, it's been months now",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is a cool app.Its best for editing videos and i love it ive been using this app for 2 years and its great!! Even tho you have no storage or space in your phone you can still export it not but sometimes it lag and freezes when i export any video it freezes and its lagging,The music is not properly synching to the video,There is some bugs..but its an awesome app.But please fix the problems or bugs cus there is some problems but i dont know how to explain but its an cool app.",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a really good editing app. It's free, it's easy to use, it's got good transitions and stuff. However, I'm experiencing issues with audio. The audio seems to be going faster than it should be going when I'm trying to make sure everything is on beat and I have no idea what's going on. The app has crashed a couple of times in the past week as well. Audio issues still are happening.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app it is very easy to use but, since the new update exporting issues have increased. When I export it sometimes replaces the whole video with a black screen and keeps audio or it plays audio and has a weird green purple color moving on the screen. I started editing vidsbfor clients but when the update happend I lost up to $40 worth of work due to exportation issues. So please revert back to what it was before the last update or two, and try implementing things from a different angle",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, the only problem I see here is the immense amount of lag. Every time I try to create a video and press play, it would just freeze and play the music but not the video. Also when exported, the video has a delay due to this issue, to me it would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the performance issues but an almost perfect app overall.",,,,,,,,,,
This app is absolutely fantastic but it is quite annoying that I have to either get pro or share it with other people to get a filter I want. If there could be less of these offers then this would be a 5 star review. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,,,,,,,,,,
"It is the best ever I have used before. Video editing, audio, effects transaction, and best thing you tube copyright checker . Just I need Ai for text to image and animation . Thank you, capcut . And the best thing is it's free for poor like me thank you again to make easy my work. I'm 57 years old now and found this easy-to-use app. All things are best but in the end whole building crashes when export time is longest . Please fix this'll. I'm using üñ• so pleeeeease fix it.Blessings üôå",,,,,,,,,,
I honestly find this the best easiest editing app that I understand to use. I'm just very confuse what happen to the templates? I suddenly am not able to watch any templates. I use/watch templates videos in capcut very very often and it's really good for me to get ideas to edit. Now I am not able to do that can you please fix whats happening? At the bottom of the screen has no buttons usually there is the profile and etc I forgot the other but there's non anymore?,,,,,,,,,,
"The editing itself is great and you can remove the watermark for free, but I'm having a serious and annoying issue where the app closes immediately after being opened and it's done this multiple times. I'm unable to open the app until I uninstall it and reinstall it because clearing cache and restarting my phone does nothing. It's the best mobile editor EXCEPT for when this happens. Please fix this, and I'll give thebapp the rating it really deserves, the bug just holds it back.",,,,,,,,,,
I don't have 2k or 4k video save option so please solve this issue. Thanks,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall amazing with minor but annoying issues: Capcut helped me grow a following on tiktok, amazing free editing software but for the minor problems, when you start a playback the frames plummet and you're stuck kinda guessing/hoping the first few seconds of your video look right, some of the options to get to certain places dont really make sense but you get used to it, the quality says its 1080p-2k/4kp but it really looks more like 720p or less dependent on the quality of video you're using.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's perfect and very capable. Works well on high end and budget phones. Please, devs, don't ruin this.",,,,,,,,,,
"My last rating was 5, but ever since pro, I've found it difficult to use when creating something. It's hard to make any form of edits when the app begins to lag or freeze. The Pro features may be great, but it causes a lot of difficulties. I've tried refreshing the app, clearing out storage, uninstalling the app, etc. Yet nothing.",,,,,,,,,,
"I LIKE IT, and its usefull but there costant bugs that can be quite difiicult to edit well and fast. It updates it they go away but they come back.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's great app, really! But I've been having this problem for a while now where the audio plays at a normal pace but the video is lagging. So when I want to replay it to see if I'm happy with it, I am not sure if I am because of the laggy video. I am not able to edit properly because of this issue. If you could fix this problem then I would give it 5 stars :)",,,,,,,,,,
"It is a very good app, but i have knocked 2 stars off because the app accesses my photos and videos in my photo app even when i havent been on the app in weeks. I just thought that was quite suspicious ü§∑.",,,,,,,,,,
"It used to be good but in the last two months I've been having problems with it, sometimes well exporting something it will just stop for no reason and well I'm watching to make sure the video is good the video will just freeze well the audio still plays and sometimes the play/ pause button won't work. I've been updating the app every time an update is available and I still have these problems",,,,,,,,,,
Compresses every video when trying to edit. The compression ruins quality and takes forever. Unusable,,,,,,,,,,
"It's best for tamplets but Tif you searching a song/music it will not showing a relevant video,also if you safe a music to fvt's it will not showing when you apply a music on the video, anyone plz guide whats wrong???",,,,,,,,,,
I cannot even open what I want to edit without the app crashing. Edit: Gave 5 stars because all you need to do to fix this is uninstall+reinstall.,,,,,,,,,,
I love this app but there is alot of problems when I put an sound It crashed like why??? When I try to export a big video it doest exports,,,,,,,,,,
I really like this app but sometimes after I record and when I watch it it stayed black and the video isn't there just the music with black screen,,,,,,,,,,
"Recently the app does not open videos on full screen, I've reinstalled the app but the issue persist, I've contacted support but no response.",,,,,,,,,,
"There isn't an option for me to update, but yet templates are still not an option on my screen as well as all the other options that should be on the bottom if the screen can I plz have help",,,,,,,,,,
The app is pretty good but sometimes it laggs and it is hard to work with other times it is amazing. The app sometimes likes to delete my clips or pictures/videos I have saved to my phone and I don't like that but other than that it is a good app. When I export my edits it likes to freeze on random parts of the video it also got way more expensive with the PRO version of it and since it started the PRO thing it has gotten more laggy I think they should get rid of the PRO thing.,,,,,,,,,,
I would've rateted it higher only if I didn't come across this issue where it won't let me get through the exporting phase of finishing up my edit.,,,,,,,,,,
"This app is great, definitely a one of the best free editing apps, I've been using this app for over a year now and with these new updates incoming, bugs also come with it too. Lately (as in December 19) my text have been going above the limit of a video, basically I try to put the text on a clip but the text also shows up in the next clip for like a millisecond, it's still somehow seeable and it ruins my videos pls fix this",,,,,,,,,,
My audio crashes in the video I use my audio and the video is 10 second the audio is 10 seconds but after 6seconds my audio stop working,,,,,,,,,,
The app is good but nowdays it is lagging so much i can't even edit or even move my cursor. Please fix it as quickly as possible.,,,,,,,,,,
Everytime i want to Export a Video it crashes !! tried million times and crashes every time.,,,,,,,,,,
Very interesting app. Everyone can use this app simply to edit their videos without any guidance keep it capcut creators good job.,,,,,,,,,,
"editing longer clips is really difficult, the lags is frustrating üòë, it freezes most times, while trying to edit",,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing overall editing, but saving takes so much time. This application will easily take up 2 GB of storage (1 video edited), and saving the video takes so much time and even crashes at 99%. After saving the video, it crashes and the app takes 5 GB of my storage then. And I need to save the video again, and takes another 2GB to save it.",,,,,,,,,,
"What is wrong with this app, It keeps showing no internet connection issue even though every other app is working properly. I re-installed it, re started my phone but it doesn't help and also it glitches a lot pls fix the problem...",,,,,,,,,,
Works fine.. but still lot of things to do to be great.. 1. Auto caption is slow in capcut.. so it will be great if it becomes faster.. 2. Auto caption should have translate function.. i can not translate japanese text to english.. so they should think about translate function.. 3. Video export is also slow.. so it should be faster.. Otherwise capcut is one of the best apps in google play store..,,,,,,,,,,
"I always use this app for editing, it's really good. But this feature called motion blur does not appear in my screen. I've tried updating it, uninstall it and install it again, nothing works. And also I'd be great if key frames were available for effects too. I'd like to be able to use motion blur. Please and thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
"The app lagges way too much, to the point it's unuseable. When you put text or an overlay on and you exit the project, when you reopen it when it reaches the text or overlay the video will freeze and it can take over 10 seconds to catch up. Then the text will also become this straight block of whatever colour you've chosen which becomes incredibly frustrating as you have to type out the whole text again",,,,,,,,,,
"Good editing app! It has lots of features but is quite difficult to use at first. it's very hard to resize things by dragging the edges because if you drag it even close to the edge of your screen, it just shoots in that direction and it's very hard to control. Edit: back to 4 stars cuz they fixed the text",,,,,,,,,,
"Been using the app for quite some time and honestly it's pretty solid. However, when i cleared some cache data for the app, suddenly all of the audio i recorded my voice on for capcut for my video wasn't audible anymore?? The audio recordings were perfectly fine just before i cleared it. Please fix this goddamn issue.",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to love this app, it was easy to use and I could make edits quick & easy. Now not only are even the most basic effects hidden behind a paywall but the glitches are somehow WORSE. This app is going downhill fast. Considering there are better editing apps out there for significantly less money with MORE overall, I'm not sure how worth it Capcut is anymore. Especially since they're prioritizing locking everything behind a paywall rather than fixing basic glitches.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for a long time now and works very well for me. It is very intuitive and versatile. The only thing I don't know is how to lock the clips in place. Because if I want to delete the clips in the front, all clips after that moves and it messes up all the timings of the clips. Please help.",,,,,,,,,,
Heyy! I've been using this app for two years and does its purpose. My only problem is everytime it crashes it will reset your work and you need to start all over again. To be honest it gives really good templates and you can share it to different social media platforms which is very convinient to use. Some apps take a really long time to use but with capcut with some simple selects you have your work! Still recomend it.,,,,,,,,,,
"It's very boring to edit, everything has a limit! I can't drag the letters to where I want, I can't crop the image the way I want, when I drag the letters or anything else on the screen it keeps getting stuck in certain places, I just wish it was smooth! that's the fault of the business that helps you keep things centralized in the middle", I can't edit, the screen freezes, the song doesn't sit, it's messed up, apart from that, it's a legend, but when you can't edit, it doesn't make sense to be a legend. Editing is almost my favorite activity. I make 20 edits almost every day and I like it very much, but I get very angry when I can't," see what happens and fix it please !!!! :("""
"I'm sorry to say that but, it's not a really good app to make videos. It almost happens everytime that it doesn't save some scences or it starts to lack. It feels like you could only make like 30 - 45 second videos with it, if you don't want it to crash or something. Even though it has a lot of features I have to give it one star üôÅüòÆ‚Äçüí?
I wants to give this 5 stars it's amazing app But here I have some issues there auto caption cannot working properly .
This is very amazing.It's has user friendly interface. Editing is very with this app I am using this for almost 2 years and I don't see any issue.
constantly crashing and not smoothly running with the scenes just use another app not worth the struggle
This app is too much good but the problem that I face almost everytime is that when I change the videos speed or put effects in that the preview in editor got laggy and not smooth and because of this I cannot edit properly but the result is fine. Also the audios that are safe in my device don't show up in audios section. Please fix this issue because it is getting irritating
It's been twitching lately",,,,,,,,,,
"This editing app is awesome, but there's an issue with the audio, for me it feels like the audio is not in sync with the video, this happens to me when I edit very long videos but for short ones everything is fine, also it's kinda hard to put an overlay in a specific place cuz of those annoying attracting lines. Hope you fix it!",,,,,,,,,,
Just brilliant all around! The most well built video editing app by a great distance.. it's a whole new universe üíñ Wish we could export only audio on Android since this is far better audio editor than most (for simple edits) ‚ò∫Ô∏è * September 2023 update: Please fix the full screen on the editor window! It's super important for me üôå When we are editing 16/9 videos when we press the full screen button it doesn't go full screen on Android. A friend using the apple version works great.,,,,,,,,,,
"CapCut worked amazing for me up until now. I installed it again to do some tiktok editing and quickly realized that if I left the current slide I was making and went to another tab (Google) the slide would turn all black and I wouldn't be able to do anything except click on my overlays. Very disappointed, only way to fix it is the uninstall CapCut, do all the work all over again and make sure not to close CapCut or switch tabs.",,,,,,,,,,
"I would give this 5 star when the issue with moving clips on the overlay timeline is fixed. üòä Hi. There's a serious issue/bug I want to report. Moving videos around on the overlay track doesn't work properly. When I move a clip, it doesn't land exactly where I want it to. It lands somewhere else and only reflects the true location when the clip is highlighted and this makes it VERY DIFFICULT to work with many overlay clips/tracks. Please see attached clip for more clarification",,,,,,,,,,
"I love this app, i do lots of edits and all flows smooth.. But the problem here is that you dont have the 4k resolution so whenever i send it to some application, it's KINDA pixelated.. Also when i exit the this app, then go back to my work, the filters,text, or stickers does move (displaced).. That's my only problem but overall it is good. Just please fix this minor issue thanks",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is actually good, the only complaint i have is it's user interface. It's kinda difficult to put your element/object accurately in different cuts, that's why I've only been using canva for that sort of issue. Canva helps me to consistently put an object at a specific position in different cuts, my only hope is that, capcut must apply that sort of feature as well. It will surely boost overall productivity/smoother videos for it's users. For now, that's my only request for this app.",,,,,,,,,,
"for a while this has been one of my favorite editing apps. easy to use, free, and simple. now I struggle to do basic functions in the app. it glitches frequently, and what was originally free is no longer. it's upsetting it's no longer free, as that was something I truly enjoyed being a broke teen. now I have to find a new app, which is a struggle in itself due to everything being on apple and not on android. enjoyed this app while I could, at least",,,,,,,,,,
"To be frank this app is really very annoying, I don't know if it's only on my phone that it's happening, cause sometimes when I try to do some certain videos seen on TikTok with this capcut, it doesn't work, and when it seems like it have worked, exporting it to TikTok will become a very big problem. I've updated it many times thinking it's because it hasn't been updated that's why it's been having issues, but still yet after updating it, it keeps on doing what it's been doing at I point",,,,,,,,,,
"It's an amazing app, all of my edits are done with Capcut, but there was a certain text animation, I think it was called the 'Wobbly Project'. Now that I look for it, I can't seem to find it in the in or out text animation, just the loop. I don't know if they have removed it or not but it is quite irritating.",,,,,,,,,,
Very great app for video editing. It has too many functions,,,,,,,,,,
Its very good but it often lags and glitches sounds I listen to the sound on my phone and its fine. Although onceI put it on capcut for a certain amount of times it suddenly has glitches and pauses in the sound. I sometimes have problems with the effects as well it is a great app just way way to many bugs and errors that I would love to see fixed in the near future. I will give this a 5 star rating to get this noticed and run by.,,,,,,,,,,
"Great app, a little bit complicated but it really helped me with my edits. Way better than other editing apps on mobile. The problem is, though, whenever I use the reverse button which I tend to during edits, it glitches EVERY SINGLE TIME. I hate that. Go fix it ya'll. ü§ßüíÖ",,,,,,,,,,
"The app is amazing! A lot of editing tools and really easy to use! Lots of stickers that make my shorts better! But since the new update came, the texting tool broke, I have submitted a report about the problem but haven't received any email or any update about it. I hope this issue gets solved as soon as possible!",,,,,,,,,,
An excellent vedio editing app for mobile. I would just want 2 things in it that would make this editing app a 10/10. 1. 3d Text Animation It would be pretty cool to have a 3d animation for your text as it is useful for people trying to make an ident. 2. Green Screening (Automated) It would make life so much easier if there was an automated green screen. The remove background is a feature but it would be cool if it could focused not on human bodies all the time.,,,,,,,,,,
"this app was doing great for several months, but all of a sudden it is not working as it should. the images are not what I put in and it will keep on showing the same image on the screen even after it has transitioned to the next image. this is very frustrating as it is very inconsistent with what it will and will not do update: if I click on the crop button, it shows the correct image that should be there. however, if I play the video then it shows the image that came two images before it.",,,,,,,,,,
It's a nice app overall and it's good for making edits or whatever but the only problem is that it's laggy and freezes too much. I don't know if it's because of my phone type or what but it makes semi pissed when I make a video with edits and it freezes midvideo or something along the lines of that and whenever you're making a longer video the stuff starts lagging and freezing and after looking over it it just looks dumb afterwards so....I'm only going to give this 3 stars.,,,,,,,,,,
"great apps ! i enjoyed using this for editing video for about a year. but please fix something,.. sometimes if you wanna drag the picture, it'll be lagging and crashing so u need more patience to edit :) . it such a shame- coz i really enjoy using this, but because of that crash and lag whenever im dragging, it'll make me stress out. please fix this oneeee (‡≤•_‡≤?",,,,,,,,,,
"So far the app is great and all. Although, still having same issues with the audio. As for the effects, I noticed most were removed which its makes it harder, since some were what I usually use. I do hope some off the features can be put back. I can't find any app that's easy to use like this one.",,,,,,,,,,
"I would rate it higher but there are some major flaws that this app makes. Everytime I don't update the app I always lag and always crashes the app. Everytime I only make a long sentence the app always makes it glitch every time. Sometimes I try to find images from Google to edit but when I come back it says ""Corrupted blah blah blah"" These things are starting to piss me off. Fix it please",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut why when I move the clip to left it doesn't move by itself like last time? Can u pls put it back to move like last time and also pls do not replace the editing buttons like speed, animation, style, delete etc. pls do not replace those buttons from anywhere else cause it's very hard finding other editing buttons. And yeah I love this app it is good/it is used for editing and more ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",,,,,,,,,,
"To be honest,this is one of the best editing apps out there. I can't find any that can compete with it. But I've been having problems with the text not syncing up with the audio,it always lags whenever I play through the video. I hope this problem can be fixed,whether it may just be a problem with my phone or it is a bug within the app,I would like to know what I can do to solve this issue and provide a better feedback because this really is a good app.",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using this app for a long time and this is the first time I have encountered a malfunction like this. I have a strong connection of wi-fi but then this past few days when I need to use tok videos or photos or at least use font of a text it always says no connection. Please fix it as soon as it can be fix because I really need to use it to edit something thats all. ""Feedback"" is no use. It couldn't send because it says that I dont have wifi connection, im getting pissed",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using capcut for almost 2 years now and it's great. It's the best editing app for me because it has a nice feature. But when I edited my videos for school yesterday, It's not responding. When I clicked the audio button it just starts logging and it automatically restarts the app over and over again.",,,,,,,,,,
"I am using cupcut app during 2020. and it is so cool. it is easy for use. the function of this app is wonderful. but, since last few month it's fall me in trouble. when I start to edit a video there is no problem but after sometime has passed is become Laggy.the play video stopped and I can't watch the edit. that's why I can't edit a video properly. actually I love cap cut. and suggest to use this app but first it have to be proper. otherwise it will be the wrost app. please make a solution.",,,,,,,,,,
"Um... I love this app, it's the only editing app I know how to use and it's very simple and easy to learn. But there's a problem, everytime I try to reverse a video it just turns into a black screen. I tried going back to home and coming back, I've tried re-opening it, and I tried updating it like I I just did. Please fix this, it's annoying and I can't post any edit because every edit I do is most likely gonna have a reverseüòê",,,,,,,,,,
"This is a good editting app but. Sometimes it gets laggy and so laggy to the point my phone just freezes. And I have to turn it off and on again. And then the video I have edited isn't saved. And when I click on the project it says ""project is not found"". I have spent so much time on that specific edit. I wanna throw a fridge at someone right now. I'm very disappointed please fix this thank you",,,,,,,,,,
The app is great it functions very well and is easy to use/get used to but the reason why I give this a 4 is because of the pro features update. I'm not a fan of it because the pro features thing was kinda unnecessary or unexpected because u have to pay for better features to edit ur video when before it was just easy to pop a effect in and the pro features idea kinda lost the uniqueness of the app because now it's just like other editing apps where u have to pay for better effects.,,,,,,,,,,
"App is kinda meh, it's by far the best *phone vids* editor i can find but it just has soo many bugs and glitches. There's a bug where the first few seconds of your video freeze, sometimes when applying transition effects the clip before that would be blurry, the app sometimes resorts to changing certain effects here and there without your concern in order to handle the video like changing the colour of text and the worst part is that these bugs show up in the end result",,,,,,,,,,
"I used to use this app so much until I always got this one issue. That issue that I am talking about is the issue of ""Internet Connection Please try again"" everytime I would try to do absolutely anything It won't let me. I always have perfect connection, and it still says that. I've used this app since 2020, and it's now saying this. I'm no longer a capcut editor because of this. Once you fix this issue I will put 5 starts.",,,,,,,,,,
"I appreciate the functionality of this app, it works well except in one instance which makes it essentially unusable. With over 5000 clips in my files it's virtually impossible to easily find the clips I want. I have to scroll & scroll & scroll until I happen upon the clip. First, there needs to be a fast scrolling button. Then there needs to be a way to alphabetized the clip/album names or group the clips by date so they can efficiently located.",,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this app for a long time now and the experience was quite stable but from a past few days this app has been stucking alot and the main features like transition, animation, font etc get stuck and can't be used. I didn't wanted to uninstall it immediately but now it have no usage in my mobile. I hope to have a fix in this app cause I still believe that no video editing app is better than Capcut.",,,,,,,,,,
"After updating process, my capcut get error. It is always say, ""no internet connection' again and again. Although I have restart my phone. The problem still exists.",,,,,,,,,,
"I love the Ui, text is good also!",,,,,,,,,,
"I really love this app, truly! But there is one thing that is really bugging me. The lag... When I put an effect it lags, like really lags, and when i play a video it lags too and it doesn't align with the music, it's quite annoying I'll be honest with you. I really hope this will be fix because I really love this app, like really really love! This would be the best video editing if you fixed the lag in my opinion.ü•∫ü•∫",,,,,,,,,,
This app is best for editing but one problem update of this app is very large and unimportant so please reslove this issue,,,,,,,,,,
Great app with lots of free functions.,,,,,,,,,,
"April 5, 2024 A decent editor overall, but I'm having a lot of issues with dragging overlay pictures and videos. They don't appear to line up properly when I drag them, and sometimes they will disappear from the timelime but not the actual video. And sometimes the overlay I try to trim shows up as the wrong item. It would be nice if they could fix this. 865 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?",,,,,,,,,,
Enjoying it so far because it's quite user-friendly!,,,,,,,,,,
This is the best app ever. Everything is really clear but if more features were given it would be better. The exporting system is a problem. It takes so much time and top of that I cannot exit the app so it would be good if you can fix anything bout this. And if there is a option to edit pics it would be the worlds best video and pic editing app. All the time If I edit any pic with this app I have to take a screenshot and then I cut the excess in my gallery but over alll itss the best.üíØüíØüíØüíØ,,,,,,,,,,
"It's performance keeps on declining as time goes by. It keeps on crashing, delay with the sound, can't handle multiple effects or animation (it will hang if you put too much effect), lagging. I'm in PRO subscription and this things is pushing me to cancel it. I love the apl but this things is making me want to stop using this. Fix this",,,,,,,,,,
"It seems like a decent app with some really neat features, but it's so confusing, and they don't seemingly explain the cut function anywhere in the tutorials/faqs when that seemed to be what they were using to draw me into the app. (or how to properly remove most of a video overlay to just the part you want appearing over the rest of it) Wow this app is awful. Try to move an overlay around and either the centering bars throw it off it or stops moving smoothly right around the spot I want it",,,,,,,,,,
"i really like this app.. it has good transition, the effects are great, lets just say everythings great but ive got some isseus with the app.. your ""TEXT"" has a bug, when you put them all together and trim the video, the text just mush in together and it really is a pain to fix it back.. and the new issue is that whenever I want to put some songs it just goes out of the video im editing and when i came back there was no audio, so i cant put songs.. the lag is also a pain.. id put 5 after you fix",,,,,,,,,,
"I would give five stars if it weren't for the guide lines. Like- the lines that appear that help you aline stuff. They see useful sometimes like with text, but when I'm trying to animate (tween) my characters it just gets it the way. Also, It's annoying when I'm trying to rotate something and it just grows a shrinks. Maybe it's just me, but I hope this gets fixedüôè",,,,,,,,,,
"I WILL NEVER EVER EDIT ON THIS APP EVER AGAIN,I EDIT A VIDEO THAT TOOK ME 5 HOURS TO EDIT AND WHEN EVERYTIME I'M CLICKING THE SAVE BUTTON IT KEEPS FREEZING WHAT THE HELL",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is an amazing free ap but heck its so lag, the only issue here is lag i swear, please im begging on my knees fix this issueüò≠",,,,,,,,,,
I can't find the template I want in Capcut. Search option gives error.,,,,,,,,,,
Capcut is so good but alot of features require pro to be used i hope in the future not that much,,,,,,,,,,
"Very easy to use, much better than the built-in instagram reel creator",,,,,,,,,,
Can you not put capcut in the corner of the screen. Thank you!,,,,,,,,,,
"This bug changes everything: pro effects, animations literally every pro function disappeared",,,,,,,,,,
Now in capcut template do not play in our mobile I says that Ur mobile does not sport this video my mobile resolution is 1080p please solve this issue,,,,,,,,,,
App just crashes for me. Can't export my edited projects. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏?In my phone it's kinda laggy because of some stuffs soo it's nothing but sometimes when I open the cap cut it turn back to home screen,,,,,,,,,,
It's so laggy and when I click on animations it freezes the screen 1 star,,,,,,,,,,
It just brilliant but sometimes there is an issue with editing,,,,,,,,,,
"Fix the current version of this app is not secure error , please fix it i want to use this app for work . Urgent right now",,,,,,,,,,
Capcut My text to speech option not showing in capcut please solve my issue.Thanks,,,,,,,,,,
Application never open Only work in wifi Lot of issues Never work properly,,,,,,,,,,
Everytime I open a project it crashes. Terrible,,,,,,,,,,
"I'd say 5 stars but there are some major issues. 1. It crashes so much that I can't use it all the time, like when I make an edit I use specific features and it crashes and bugs out. 2. I use the ""manga"" style a lot, and at first it was ok but now it won't work, and I've even tried on other devices, uninstalling and reinstalling nothing seems to work. 3. Lastly some features arnt as smooth while editing an it really messes up the process. So could you please fix this capcut development team.",,,,,,,,,,
"This new update is absolutely horrible. I have been making films with this app for years now and this ""premium"" thing is the LEAST if the issues. Even with Pro, all of the creativity with effects and text is gone. With only about 7-10 fonts. And from what I've seen, no one has noticed this. Capcut was an amazing app, but now this app is disgusting. Please bring back creativity.",,,,,,,,,,
"Using this app originally was great, little bugs and crashes. However, lately it's been refusing to work with many bugs, crashes and image deletion, and now it refuses to open in general. While it could be something on my part, I am unable to fix it because whenever I attempt to open it, it closes immediately.",,,,,,,,,,
"i personally love this editor, the app is great but I'm so disappointed capcut FOR REAL everytime I try to edit ang then save it (not export) when I came back to finish the video I edited it always says deleted file black screen even though the video is not deleted from my gallery, I thought it's just a bug but no it keeps happening to me and ITS SO ANNOYING. I have to re edit just to finish it PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!",,,,,,,,,,
Me personally I do really like the app but there were just a few mistakes I want to get fixed whenever I open the app it always starts with a black screen and then it just kicks me out of the app automatically I don't know what has gone into this but it's been happening in the months now I really wanted to get fixed so I could do edits but overall this app is amazing.,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall the app is good. There is this one problem though. When I try to put an effect on to the video, it freezes and it makes me exit the app and repeat over and over until the effect finally goes on the video. Please fix it. The transitions and everything is amazing too.",,,,,,,,,,
Amazing! The app itself is fantastic. Great features and VERY user friendly. Since it is linked with TikTok it is very easy to use nice sounds you found on TikTok! I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for some of the bugs but I'm sure they will get fixed soon. Either way it is a fantastic app! Well done üëç (Edit:After the big template update the bugs were fixed very quick! Templates are so cool!),,,,,,,,,,
"I wanted to give a 5 star but there is a kinda big problem that I hope you can fix. Whenever I putted another video overlay on the other one that I was using, after a transition the video dosent play correctly, it stutter stopping very quickly for the rest of the video. I hope you can fix this little error, because for the rest the app is amazing!",,,,,,,,,,
"The app works fine but recently out of nowhere I keep getting these error messages that say ""security risk"" and tell me to update but I'm on the latest version. I don't want to uninstall and reinstall incase I lose any of my data so for now I'm completely locked out of the app.",,,,,,,,,,
"It's really good! I can make good edits with it, rarely crashes and has no lag! If I could change one things it's to make more effects and transitions free since I can't get pro. Overall, solid app.",,,,,,,,,,
"Been using this since 2 years hehe, but uhm the thing is.. I don't want to say but if the template error about no connection error, I wanted to fix that, because my connection is open and sometimes it errors in any way especially the search was not showing either.",,,,,,,,,,
I love this app but sometimes it crashes and won't let you back into your projects so you have to delete them and start from scratch which is FRUSTRATING but otherwise good,,,,,,,,,,
This application was working very well but ever since its update it is very annoying it hangs again and again it freezes the mobile and editing is a torture please fix it because I don't like any other app for editing except capcut.. I'll be very thankful to you,,,,,,,,,,
This is good app all features has been amazing but when video exports then takes a lot of time and during exporting video i can't use other app if I use the video could not be exported and starts from over i think your team should resolved this issue .,,,,,,,,,,
"This us a great app but, there's this ONE problem that annoys me . So I'd make a good video, but when it's exported it's be terrible.Example,I'd put like many screen shots and make a video and when it has been exported, it's only like 5 or 6 screenshots.I really like the app but that problem makes me wanna delete it. And also asked me for a user experience and in question 8, it asked me to give them a video, but in the gallery, it doesn't let me put video, I don't know if that's the apps fault.",,,,,,,,,,
"Dear CapCut, I'm always use this brilliant app but on the latest update, when I open the EFFECTS while editing my video, my phone crash and lagging. After crash, it went back to menu screen. I can still edit video but can't use the effects and it's not normal just don't press the effects button or else it will be a screenshot like you know... please fix this ASAP.",,,,,,,,,,
"its a really great app and ive used it a few times before. but after the update ive been experiencing some issues when using music from my phone it gliches out when i make an edit with videos. and when i extract the project, the music isnt in sync like it was in the app. please do fix this issue as soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciatedüôèüôè",,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using CapCut for a very long time now and with the updates it always got easier and better but at the same time laggier amd laggier. It wasn't that laggy before so I ignored it but now, even after factory resetting my phone it lags to the point where when I make even one cut the app either crashes or just freezes all the time where it just becomes unuseable. I really like CapCut and would like to continue using it but if it's so laggy I can't even use it then I can't really use CapCut",,,,,,,,,,
"It's good. But it sometimes has bugs which is kind of frustrating due to the fact I play Zepeto and I need this app. But everything else perfect! I love the templates, and I love the overlay button, and it's just so much more easier than having to do all that work on other apps.",,,,,,,,,,
I love this app. It has no watermark and it's the best. But the reason I gave it four stars is that when I type my text really quickly or slowly it glitches and sometimes put the exact same word more than once. And I have not a lot of space in my phone and this app takes a lot of space. If the text glitch and less space would make this the perfect app for me.,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not going to give this app a whole entire five stars because whenever I use Auto velocity and it saves it to my clip it just like freezes the clip into one frame so like I could be editing and they could be like a video with a bunch of like different frames on it and then I use Audible ocity and then it just freezes the clip and there's nothing I can do about it and I've tried so much but there's nothing I can do about it and it sucks. So yeah, 3 stars",,,,,,,,,,
Can't even export vids..it crashes,,,,,,,,,,
"I've been using capcut for a little over a year, and it's a pretty great app. However in the newest update the text is completely ruined and it is 1000x harder to use. Please go back to how the text worked before the 7.2 update. Otherwise it can sometimes be glitchy and difficult to import media. Please fix these issues.",,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut is a great editing software before but now a lot of the tools that can help you is blocked behind a pay-wall and you would have to buy the pro version just to use it. Not to mention that everytime it does its regular update it doesnt let you do anything anymore. Try and make a video, it will crash and not let you do it. I lost many progress on a video just because of the regular update. Overall, Capcut has many issues with it but it still is decent",,,,,,,,,,
"Easy to edit I'm just a beginner here when I just installed but then.. when I started making YouTube vids by this and it updated several time and started to make a warning that says ""if you want to continue edit thus it need an update"" and I have to click OK several times and it's quite annoying 2nd sometimes when I edit an animation it sometimes replay where I did not animation the picture and its kinda annoying pls fix these two bugs (there is 481 characters in this message)",,,,,,,,,,
One of if not the easiest editing softwares for mobile if not overall. Very nice to use and endless possibilities. I know that sounded like an npc review but it is true. The ability to use templates is also so nice but I wish there were easy to follow structures/guides to build certain types of videos like versus battles without being restricted by a template.,,,,,,,,,,
The app is really great. Buh I think it's having some issues. Some template aren't working. Always telling me to update my capcut. Buh whenever I try updating it. It will count from 1 to 100. Nd then send a message saying this won't work. That I should try again later. Please I really really wish u will fix this. Thanks ü•∞ü•∞,,,,,,,,,,
You always say there has been a error when I put a sticker on my wallpaper I hate this ü§¨,,,,,,,,,,
"I have been using this app for 3 years, it's a good app for editing and other stuff. I've also improved alot in capcut since I've been practicing. But one issue is when the video is too long, it lags. Please fix this issue. Overall, this app is really good. That's all from me i hope you fix it!",,,,,,,,,,
"Okay, I've been using capCut for a long time now, I once gave this a 5 star ratings b4 and I can say this is a really amazing Editing app but for some reason after I reinstalled this on my phone the screenshots that I put together on the vid kept on lagging and the app isn't working much properly, please fix this type issue the app is getting slower and slower until it my phone suddenly blacked out and the app is suddenly cannot be used. That's all the issues I have been experiencing.Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,
"THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER! I always use it for my edits and my friened said "" Wow u edit so good what app is it?"" And I'm like ""capcut?"" And she tried it to do her edits and she LOVES it! Thanks and there is one problem, it always lags while I'm trying to edit and I always have to re-installing over and over again so sometimes I can't do good edits because its really laggy and sometimes it shows a black screen in my pictures, I hope you can fix that and I'll rate it a 5 star!üòä",,,,,,,,,,
It was good at first then the songs would play for 2 seconds and the videos would stay quiet,,,,,,,,,,
"Personally , capcut is quite a great application. I use them mostly for YouTube and TikTok videos and they come out nicely doneüòäü§ó",,,,,,,,,,
Thanks for fixing the tracking button. I have complete five star,,,,,,,,,,
Absolutely amazing app. I love constantly learning and getting better to make videos to the best I can. But the only issue I have is there's no vibration setting. It gets annoying when you have so many effects to copy and paste and my phone is just an earthquake when lining them up.,,,,,,,,,,
"Havent tested it much bit it seems amazing, the only feature its missing is a very simple one, please allow us to edit videos in landscape mode because holding your phone in portrait for a long time is painful and uncomfortable, if there was an option for landscape editing this would easily be the best video editor currently available for phones. Now i get that making it wont be easy because the UI would have to completely be reworked, but just that one feature would make it incredible",,,,,,,,,,
"Really good for editing, but they really need to fix the cropping feature. If you want a certain size, it will crop it too small and won't let you zoom out. Or if you're cropping freely, it will freeze and make you start over. Edit: they finally fixed the cropping feature! 5 stars!",,,,,,,,,,
I like the app and also the templates but now this app become a total mess now I can't use the search the templates option .it just say (tap to try again) over over whenever I tap the searched option beside that when I export my edits it's quilaty goes down..app was just fine month ago but now it become worst . I hope u fixed the searching options..and so thank u,,,,,,,,,,
One of the best apps out there! Has a lot of features that a lot of mobile editors don't and is suitable for projects and fandom edits - this comes from someone who edits a lot on PC. The only downside is the large file size after it exports. Anything other than that runs smooth as ever! Thanks!,,,,,,,,,,
A very good video editing app. But i am facing issue where i am not able to select small clips of 0.1 or 0.2 secs. The bars at the start and shop and too big that smaller clips are impossible to select. And while selecting it says clip too small to apply transition.. which i am not trying to do.. i just want to extend the clip.. but its not letting me.,,,,,,,,,,
I personally like this app but when it comes to Capcut PC its quite not worth it I just want the developers to work on the PC version too please I will be greatful its not just me many people like the desktop version and they want it too please !,,,,,,,,,,
Love the app so much!! But recently it has been very laggy and keeps crashing I have tried it with other devices and other networks and it still was crashing. I would give this a 5/5 but the crashing gets very annoying after you take a very long time to make an edit just for it to crash.,,,,,,,,,,
everything requires internet connection. have to compress video before you even start editing. almost no control over export quality.,,,,,,,,,,
quite enjoyable and the photos tend to nail it. I really enjoyed this app. it's a lot of fun and it's fun to create over the videos that are on this app for TikTok or Instagram or Facebook. I love it! thanks guys for making it fun!,,,,,,,,,,
Very best editing app . I tried many editing apps but capcut is best.But it crash many times during editing.Please fix this problem.,,,,,,,,,,
Best app for editing because every movement is editing easily but it have one issues of template creator i was apply for that but no reply i was try before 2 months but not so please solve this issues thank you üôè,,,,,,,,,,
"Capcut. Capcut is an amazing editing app overall. It's perfect for editors who cannot afford to pay for editing apps like me. One problem is that when I'm doing velocity it goes smoothly until suddenly everything goes offbeat but when I export it, it comes off just normal. I would appreciate it if y'all could fix this issue? Also don't mind my name it's a glitch idk why it puts it as Ram√†cha√±dran krish√±√†samy when in reality it's ashüßê",,,,,,,,,,
"Please fix the crashing~ I can't edit the pictures because of this, and the animation is nowhere to be found, I can't edit anime ones without itüò£ Please fix this",,,,,,,,,,
"There is this issue when you are exporting a video, it's stuck to 0% and just completely lags. I hope you fix this.",,,,,,,,,,
"This app keeps crashing after the last update. Even before, app lag a lot. And I have the paid version. No more! This is unacceptable!",,,,,,,,,,
"This is the best editing app!! I love it! You can get your favourite songs with searching and no other app has this feature. The builders of this app, a great salute to youüòÅ",,,,,,,,,,
Fix your age screening input! You lost a potential Pro user becauseyour ridiculous app somehow thinks I'm younger than 13 and won't let me create an account or re-create an account... and there's no help to fix this.,,,,,,,,,,
Too many errors and videos after editing is missing in between clips. only audio or text is seen.,,,,,,,,,,
"Would be a great app if it didn't crash every single time you try to export to tiktok. As it is, it's useless.",,,,,,,,,,
"App always crashing when i tried to save the videos. Acter updating, still have the crash. Please make it works!",,,,,,,,,,
"Getting bored! Been using the app for awhile, it's the same old stuff all the time. Never any updates or anything new. Paid for Pro thinking it might be better, nope. I need to quit wasting my $$$",,,,,,,,,,
"(changed my rating)I like using capcut, but here's the problem that I have. When I go to slow down the video, using ""better quality"" button it does not work and it's so annoying because I have to keep trying but still don't work. Please fix this problem. Also now auto valocity isn't working! What the freak capcut!? This app is just getting worse and worse!",,,,,,,,,,
I Broke my S22 ultra last night due to this 5uking stuck App Honestly i spent 3 hour on my project then during exporting this 5uking App stuck & restarted again i spend almost 2 and half hour then Again Same error i am a premium user i cancelled my Auto subscription And going to delete if your team do not fix the bugs & glitches plz don't Run your company.
