First, whenever I make videos that are 1 mins or more, CapCut freezes when I try to put in texts for subtitles or overlays. This then effects the preview of the video. I did some of this before but it is just getting worse. And secondly, unexpected lags which then caused my to get kicked out of the app. Can you please sort this out?",
