        "comment": "Thanks for the nice and easy layouts for this app. It was great with the templates and all, but one thing is that when the template has slow motion or applying something heavy, it always shows black screen and suddenly my phone black out itself. It was such lame to experience that. maybe just me tho, but so far it was fine. I suggest to make this app has it own storage like how telegram works. Thank You !!",
