The reason it's not getting the full five star is because of the removal of the makeup filters. There used to be some really fun ones, but now I can't find them. Also, this might just be my inexperience, but I can't find the option to actually cut parts ot of videos. You can trim the ends, but in the middle as far as I'm aware, there's no way to cut parts out.",
