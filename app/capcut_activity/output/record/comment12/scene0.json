        "comment": "To be frank this app is really very annoying, I don't know if it's only on my phone that it's happening, cause sometimes when I try to do some certain videos seen on TikTok with this capcut, it doesn't work, and when it seems like it have worked, exporting it to TikTok will become a very big problem. I've updated it many times thinking it's because it hasn't been updated that's why it's been having issues, but still yet after updating it, it keeps on doing what it's been doing at I point",
