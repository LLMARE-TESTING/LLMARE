All in all, I think it's a really good app. Everything works smoothly and there's quite a lot of option for editing. The reason it's not getting the full five star is because of the removal of the makeup filters. There used to be some really fun ones, but now I can't find them. Also, this might just be my inexperience, but I can't find the option to actually cut parts ot of videos. You can trim the ends, but in the middle as far as I'm aware, there's no way to cut parts out.

To be frank this app is really very annoying, I don't know if it's only on my phone that it's happening, cause sometimes when I try to do some certain videos seen on TikTok with this capcut, it doesn't work, and when it seems like it have worked, exporting it to TikTok will become a very big problem. I've updated it many times thinking it's because it hasn't been updated that's why it's been having issues, but still yet after updating it, it keeps on doing what it's been doing at I point

I really love this app, truly! But there is one thing that is really bugging me. The lag... When I put an effect it lags, like really lags, and when i play a video it lags too and it doesn't align with the music, it's quite annoying I'll be honest with you. I really hope this will be fix because I really love this app, like really really love! This would be the best video editing if you fixed the lag in my opinion.\u9983\u30ba\u9983\u30ba

I like the app. However, there's only one issue. and if the update fixes it I'll rate this 5/5, Ok! my issue is when I just trying to export a song it just keeps backing it goes to the home page and when I try to repeat the situation it is just keep forcing to go to the home page, Please Fix (Thank You!)

Dear CapCut, I'm always use this brilliant app but on the latest update, when I open the EFFECTS while editing my video, my phone crash and lagging. After crash, it went back to menu screen. I can still edit video but can't use the effects and it's not normal just don't press the effects button or else it will be a screenshot like you know... please fix this ASAP.

I am a beginner when it comes to the field of editing but I am a fast learner. Learning to use Capcut app was great however when I finish editing the whole video I can't export it. And when I try the capcut pro features always pop up like I just want to save my edited video for the first time. And this app is ruining my mood.

Glitches sometimes but overall pretty good Edit: You can't do anything near complex without it lagging or taking forever. I tried to reverse a 0.6 second video and it took me 15 minutes for it to finally complete, then it'll just randomly crash. Updating didn't even help. This app just keeps going downhill after every update.

If I'm being completely honest I wish I could give it 6 stars!! Its so easy to figure out, you're able to remove the watermark, overlay, use all of the animation styles, FOR FREE!!! the only problem is when you split a video it doesnt work corrects but that's just a small bug and can be fixed by exiting out and going back in really quickly! I love it so much!!!

Just brilliant all around! The most well built video editing app by a great distance.. it's a whole new universe 馃挅 Wish we could export only audio on Android since this is far better audio editor than most (for simple edits) 鈽猴笍 * September 2023 update: Please fix the full screen on the editor window! It's super important for me 馃檶 When we are editing 16/9 videos when we press the full screen button it doesn't go full screen on Android. A friend using the apple version works great.

This app came from a 4.5star to a 1star. I'm aorry but it's functionality over features. It has many feature's but too many bugs. When I'm editing something for example, i press play and the timeline is not moving at all. I have 0 ways to use it. It literally is good only for TikTok templates and not even for that cause even there the clip si moving in 3fps.

The app is really great. Buh I think it's having some issues. Some template aren't working. Always telling me to update my capcut. Buh whenever I try updating it. It will count from 1 to 100. Nd then send a message saying this won't work. That I should try again later. Please I really really wish u will fix this.

Suddenly, the Google app will not stay open. Opens for 2 seconds, then closes. Any idea why? It's been working fine until 9/14/2024. Chrome app still works no problem (thankfully). The Google app is a 5 star app, but I gotta it 2 stars for now. Back to 5 stars once resolved.

Too many graphics!! I just want to search. I did not need a visual graphic next to every result! It takes up so much real estate on mobiles. The graphic is bigger than the search summation leaving big gaps between each result. Then when you get to place where you have to hit more results it erupts into a total mess of graphic fillers. What a cluster!!!

Current issue is this app CONSTANTLY giving me a pop-up at the bottom of the screen trying to prompt me to sign in. It is insanely annoying, especially when you come close to clicking on it while en route to click something else before the pop-up appears. If I wanted to sign in, I would. If there's a way to prevent that from happening, that would be excellent.

Amazing... Mostly, I love chrome, it's the only browser I use and for the most part it works, but as of late I've noticed that it won't let me update it, I have a Moto G stylus and it says that chrome needs an update and when I press the update button it starts then stops and then the update button is there again, and this will repeatedly happen, I've tired force stopping and disabling it and it still won't work. Please look into this.

Remove the grid layout and employ some human factors engineers. This is literally the worst forced implementation, works against the user in every possible way, and is completely inefficient. Most people using this on mobile want speed and efficiency, which is negated when you have to search through grid tiles you can't see or go through multiple groups you didn't make because of automatic grouping. REMOVE THIS FEATURE.

Can't figure out how to fix the teensy non-flowable font size when I try to play solitaire. The words and icon are half the cell phone width. If I stretch the screen to make it better, the copy doesn't reflow to fit the screen...it just gets so big that I have to jiggle the copy or image left to right. this weird screen appearance happened suddenly yesterday on my Nokia phone. No idea what to do. Asaaaargh!!!!
