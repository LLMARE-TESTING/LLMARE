(it is funny that the thubnail for the enhancement looks good, but it is not what you get when you apply it). The new update has a weird UI and the placement of controls are not user friendly, and looks toy-ish. Liked the old interface with all the slider controls in one place.",

This can be further broken down into their preference for the old interface where all the slider controls were in one place.",
