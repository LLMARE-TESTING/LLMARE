Terrible update. Terrible new logo. The editing is now a complicated mess to navigate. Each type of adjustment is now separated in a horizontal scrolling menu so you have to slide back and forth as you try to make adjustments. Go back to the single view of the adjustment sliders so we can actually see what we're doing!",
