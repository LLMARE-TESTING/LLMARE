NEEDS a lock photo and lock album feature that is password protected for extra security (for sentitive documents, etc), where previews of the album cannot be seen from the photos homepage. Archive is not secure enough especially since you cannot lock any albums. This would be a useful feature when letting someone you know borrow your phone. The search feature is quite useful in finding specific photos though.",
