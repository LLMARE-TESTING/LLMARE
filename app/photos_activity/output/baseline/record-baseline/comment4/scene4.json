First thing: I had the WORST time syncing things so that they would show up on my computer/desktop, from my phone. When I realised they weren't syncing, there were over 5000 photos to sync (I take a lot, and edit a lot). So then I try to sync them. For the life of me, I can't get them to sync over. So... I start searching. Seems like a few people (that I could find) had the same problem. The fix? I had to shut off my wi-fi, turn on the sync over data option, go back in, then it starts syncing, so I turn the wi-fi on again... it goes for about 250-350 photos... so I think... cool - it's working. NOPE. It goes back to the \"preparing backup\" spinning circle of death. So then I do the same thing. And it works again. Then it gets stuck again. So far I think I've done it about 12 or 15 times... and I still have over 2100 photos to do. So - THAT'S annoying. Second... I have to agree with someone else here, on their low review. WHY, when you delete a phone from Google Photos, does it delete on the stock photo app of the phone as well. Oh and I dislike the editing feature as well - it's very limited. But now maybe I'm just getting picky...",
