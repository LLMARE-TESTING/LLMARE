We could once select which album(s) on our phone we wanted to back up to photos, now everything is automatically uploaded and saved under \"Camera\" with pictures/vids you DIDN'T want saved now saved and its frustrating. Cause if you send them to trash it will delete them from your phone. I sent feedback about it and never got a reply. That one feature loss screwed this app up for me.",
