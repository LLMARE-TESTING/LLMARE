5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still a good app, but shows a full screen update message every time you open it (exactly 1 month after updating). Also, if you have cloud backup disabled, it sometimes nags you to enable it, and to skip it, you have to restart the app, as saying ""NO"" to it, it will take a random amount of photos and upload them to your cloud anyways. Can you kindly stop with these intrusive messages? Your app works fine as is. What about an option to select the default screen on startup (for example: Library)?",

It's really frustrating when Google keeps changing the feature photo I've set for some people, especially when they change it to a completely different person, and then I have to clear out a bunch of wrong photos to find the one I had previously selected.

5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because of the 'Memories' feature. It's such a special and important function for me. But there's two things about using it which frustrate me to no end! 1. No 'delete' option for individual pictures/videos, or the entire 'memory'. 2. No 'move' option for the files/memory, if I want to create a folder or move items to an existing folder. These functions would allow me to tidy my files up a little each day; instead, their absence just causes me daily frustration instead!",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos app is really nice, except for the fact that it's always complaining it needs to update and the app is huge. I'd rather use the memory on photos than on apps, thanks. // Edit: Yes, I have automatic updates disabled.

5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Edit; not a fan of the recent updates and how they've moved around the buttons and changed the layout. It looks a bit clunky and I find myself tapping where things used to be. It's a bit annoying. Also I'm not a fan of these annoying forced app updates. Nobody wants an app to take up MORE space on their phone! There is NO REASON why I needed or wanted to update this app.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it ,when they put together photos for video memories. I've ordered photo books too ,you can get hardback or regular . I'm not sure if they offer a disk. That's something I'd love to get .I have to many photos to keep on my phone, putting them on a disk would allow the whole family enjoy them on our big screen tv üòçü§©,and allow me not to have to pay for extra space. Anyone thinking about ordering from Google photos,can be assured that it's quality photos and it's fairly priced too. ENJOY",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app just keeps getting more annoying. I really wish there was a way to roll back to 2019 version. Really frustrating to have ads for a product I pay for constantly presented.

Also apparently Google didn't even read the review",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: if I could I would take away the one star because of then ""bot"" feedback. I don't have issues adding photos or achieving them later on. I have a problem that when I'm adding multiple pictures to an album I have to re-sekect then again just to archive. There is not a single ""button"".

I'm wondering how productively people can use it to manage their collection of photos.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whatever's happened in the most recent update has knackered the ability to add text to images in the editing features. I can get the words on the image but controlling the location and sizing has become a pain. Assuming this is investigated and fixed, it would be nice to see the text autofill the box size fully rather than just on height.

5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly good, but I have 2 main issues. Navigation to albums is made more difficult that it needs to be; or should be. Instead of a single press to get to an album menu (navigable from the bottom bar) this app desires that you should navigate to library, and then select on all albums if the album you seek isn't within the first handful of options. Not good. The app also keeps begging me to ""backup my photos to drive"", despite having selected no. Remember my choice, and stop trying to steal data",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really wish there was a way to redownload backed up photos and videos in bulk. There are many gallery-cleaning apps that allow you to go through your camera roll and swipe to delete/keep items, which is something I really need because I'm running out of storage, but they can only access local files and the majority of my images are stored in the cloud instead of my device. Alternatively, if the app had a built-in sorting feature. Except for that, it's great!",

One major bug I've encountered that hard-locks the Google photos app, is using the Audio eraser feature on a Video Boosted video.

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Takes away control. ""Features"" are forced on you even when you expressly turn them off. With back up turned off it'll still back up photos if you move them to an album. Albums are a painful experience in and of themselves. The UI is a mess, not intuitive in the slightest. Going into the cloud to examine and organize is extremely slow even on fast home internet or 5G. Adding features is fine just stop anticipating what I want and let me control my own device and photos, stop controlling me.",

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"An okay app but deliberately uses underhanded tactics to push unwanted features. Best example is the backup feature. Turning off automatic backup means receiving reminders to backup regularly.

To undo the action one must log on with a computer and delete items individually (no ""select all"" present). Sketchy practices from a sketchy company.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really annoying app, first, what dictates a photo being in the ""Photos' section and not the Library? Feels random and I don't feel in control of it. Second, when I turn off backup I did it because I wanted to, why keep asking to turn it on? Then when I say I don't want to back up, it then prompts again to back up manually with a load of images pre-selected, I'm pretty sure I said no?! Nowwhere in settings to stop this. Pretty infuriating.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was really disappointed when I found out tagging is not allowed. This feature is really basic and all other apps have that. We have a lot of images and we need to find them fast. That's what tagging is for. Not a lot of time is spent on making the app. It's just made for money. :( Update: you cannot even email any photos by tapping share. It's getting worse. Update: you can't even copy a photo easily on this app. Very unorganized! Getting worse! It deletes your photos without permission. üò≠,
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Buggy and intrusive. If you only want some photos backed up, forget about it. Even with cloud backups disabled, Photos will still crawl through every folder on your phone to find photos, then back them up to the cloud without your permission. There is no way to disable this. For Google Home devices, photo frame capabilities are very problematic. Albums will refuse to update when more photos are added. Newer albums won't even show up as selectable.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok, but the search capabilities are very limited, coming from Google. Advanced users should be able to create more capable searches, such as finding pictures taken by camera X or Y, or finding pictures that are in the intersection of 2 albums, or searching the difference between albums, finding pictures that count towards your quota vs not, filter by backup quality...

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe you guys got rid of one of the most useful features of the app - the map. It was super easy to find a photo if you knew where it was taken, by looking at the map and picking it out from the location. Not surprising though, Google always kills off the most useful features.

No, this trash app put them in a folder and not the main album. The memories tab is also useless and shouldn't be forced. I don't care about several random Facebook photos from five years ago being spotlit for no reason other than the date. Also, transparent PNGs end up in a weird black box instead of transparent.

5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is one of the best apps for photos. Live album is too good. It recognizes photos from the camera store and organises in the album without an error.

It should segregate photos which are not part of any album. It will be easier to clear clutter.,

Worse, if you use Photos to delete a photo on the phone, it doesn't go into (restorable) phone trash but a weird Photos deleted folder. And DON'T hit the ""eject SD card"" button in Photos!

I ran into the same problem when I was adding pictures to Google slides.

5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down the best photo service currently amongst icloud, Dropbox, amazon etc. Just works. It's even better if you take pics from multiple devices they all show up in the same place. Assistant is good too, but is more of a me too feature. Good basic editing features too. And many more that most users will never use. The sharing feature ie album sharing could do some more work. It's very confusing right now and not straightforward. It doesn't need to be so. The only other ask is to allow high res / original quality uploads. Highly recommended. Boo on Apple for not even coming close and asking so much money to do basic sync of photos across devices.",

Especially paying for storage, you'd think you could make that a feature...",

Also, I have an album which i update daily and I've set it to 'most recently added' in the sort menu. The pictures still don't show up in this order and some are even out of the album which I never intended to remove which isn't good. Hope this gets fixed.",

I've needed my car's license plate before, and knowing that I had taken a photo of my car, I searched Photos for ""license plate"". And voila, I found the photo I took of my car.

If you want to scroll back to like 2016 it will take about 45 minutes, IF you don't accidentally click back to today's date. You can't organize your photos in Drive anymore, either. They said that was too confusing. They could have added an advanced ""View Photos in Drive"" toggle to let superusers turn that feature on so we could easily move photos into folders, but they don't want you to be able to move your photos to a new service easily.

Not to mention the clock is ticking on using this as ""free"" storage. Once you are hooked, seems you do as they say. This seems to be the trend with Google, to keep removing services, and consolidating and incorporating them into another app like was done with Google Music to YouTube Music. Totally inferior experience. And now the service will become pay as you go which will call for ever increasing amount you pay as you continue to store photos with them. Have to add that, with the removal of monitoring local storage, I connected the phone to a PC and deleted 1000s of locally stored photos., a few gigabytes. App still shows the SAME number of files I need to remove. Even after clearing the cache, it still says that I need to remove the same files to reclaim the space.

5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos used to be great. However, I noticed that new features added in the past one or two years tend to be buggy. For example, the small iconic preview of the videos does not work properly on my phone: it often flashes, and thumbnails of one video appear on top of another. Uploading videos is also a pain: the videos are usually not ready for download on PC after uploaded from my phone. It always says the video is being processed. I had to wait for tens of minutes or hours sometimes. I don't know what Google is doing with the video upon uploaded, maybe running ML algorithms for annotations, but why prevents users from downloading it since it is already uploaded? The same issue happens if I upload a video to Google Drive. A more recent feature is showing groups of photos 1-3 years ago. When I click on one group, it automatically goes to slideshow, which is fine. However, I don't like the full screen: I keep clicking on the lower-left corner of my phone to exit it, but the ""back"" button is not there and the screen simply goes to the next picture.

Second, the free space offered in the cloud isn't really that much. Once in the cloud not all photos can be downloaded back to device, which is kind of a big deal. Downloading photos back from the cloud files are compressed/smaller. Would be nice to have a lock feature/vault for private photos.

I've used the search by name, face, date, location, and even theme features to find the photos I need. I have thousands of photos stored so these options are important to me! Another thing I love is that it suggests and creates movies and slideshows of my photos when I take several at once. Equally important is the ease of sharing albums.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is great. You can see all your photos and it is better than any default android gallery and it's really handy to back up your photos.

5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2021 update: still a terrible app. Jist wish there was a good competitor and I would drop Google in a heartbeat. Original review: Bad experience. They're always changing where the menu options are with each update . Guess what that is not necessary. Most annoying thing: when u try to add a description tova photo the keyboard covers the text area where you are writing so you cannot see if you made any mistakes. This had been a problem for a while.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As I understand this, if a photo is here it was put here as a back up. Further, after I did the initial backup of all my photos to date, any other photos I take after that are automatically backed up here (if you are connected). I already saw evidence that it does happen. That is a very cool feature. All I need to do is periodically move them to my own permanent hard drive. Currently, this is the ONLY means for me to eventually get my photos from my phone to my PC where I can put them on a permanent backup hard drive. For some unknown reason neither bluetooth nor a USB cable transfer from my phone will work for that purpose. Almost fool proof. . . .",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For starters, I absolutely love Google Photos. It has become my one-stop solution for managing all of my photos that I own. I am a long-time user of the service now. However, with one of the latest updates (using on Pixel 3, Android 9), the Assistant now shows 'Order Prints' as a primary function, instead of 'Save'. This is an extremely tacky update that undermines the trust that I have in the service. Now every time I use the Assistant tab, I feel like I'm being up-sold to pay for their print services. I see this as a big step back for the app and will definitely reduce my use of the Assistant features.",

The movie feature is amazing. I was able to create a video from all the stored photos over the years for my fathers funeral, which was super helpful during such drastic times. The animation and simple suggestions help me a great deal. Most importantly it allows me to free up space from my phone and store photos here.",

5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The Photos application is great. It is very convenient that all my photos get automatically backed up and soon appear on the web in Google Photos. I've allowed the app to remove the photos stored locally on my phone but there is practically no difference in accessing them. This freed up lots of memory. The automatic backup of photos is just one feature of many I really like.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DO NOT use the Move to Folder feature!!!! I moved a few photos to a new folder to make it easier to organize them. The photos changed to all blanks and the date of capture changed to the time of move! How does that happen! I've also noticed that sometimes moving the photos to Google Drive also overrides the date of capture. So you lose the timeline and also the images are out of order and can't be arranged chronologically.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love that when you move images between folders, they just duplicate or never move at all, and if you delete the old original or also deletes the copy. There's no user friendly organization. I love that you took away folder view from the home screen of the app so you have to dig for what you want. Saving pictures creates a new folder for every image type. I wish I could install a replacement for this piece of work, and get rid of your app entirely. It's a nightmare for someone with OCD.",

And I try to share it, it says ""We could not process your video/photo"" Like, what?!

The fact that all my photos are being scanned through to create these videos, stylized photos, collages, etc.. makes me a bit uneasy if I'm being honest. However, I don't always want to take the time to make these things for Holidays, or Birthdays, and such so they are often appreciated. One more note, I have some ""personal"" photos that occasionally get mixed in with pictures of my kids, and therefore some videos come with a little...surprise!",

Also is there any chance of an option to create folders in Google Photos. It would contribute to a more organized layout.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is great, the backup feature is even greater. The only suggestion I have is that can you add a scheduler for backup. I countries like India, we get data cap for each day. But we dont want all of it to be used up for backing up the photos and videos we took, but we won't want to waste it either, so by adding a scheduler, we can use all the remaining data by the end of the day. Do consider. Thanks alot for the app.",

Also, I don't like that it sorts or groups the photos by date, I hope there's a feature to disable that. The albums look very stylish and simple though which I love but I opted out of it eventually because of customization issues which other photo galleries have ease of access.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Development is centered around creating silly features instead of fundamental functionality. For instance, uploading videos pretends to be fast, but a low resolution version is created first before you are able to access the high bitrate version (it's completely opaque when the full quality video will be available).

5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tons of options! Lifesaver when it comes to backing up pictures from your gallery. If not for Google Photos I would have lost 1000 precious memories numerous times. Also love the map/timeline feature and having the option to view photos from where they were taken. It's like you get to experience and relive the memory all over again. Smooth interface and easy to navigate.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for photo management for a very long time now. I especially love(d) the photo editor. Recently they updated it and entirely changed the interface. I believe this is to make the features of the editor more independent so people that may not have been aware of their existence are able to have a basic understanding of how they work. Unfortunately this also had drastically slowed down their functionality as each needs to be swiped to now. I'm going to stop using it.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor. The Album function displays photos in random sequence, not in the order I choose, and removes photos from the album when I try to rearrange them. I've reported this issue to Google repeatedly, to no avail. Another issue: there used to be a way to starred photos as ""Favorites"" but that feature appears to be gone and all the photos I had starred as ""Favorites"" are no longer so. There are other issues but these two are the most serious ones for me Seeking alternatives to this product.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how Google Photos organizes photos not only by date, but by face (recognition), and how it offers logical suggestions that I usually accept.

Overall, it helps me to easily organize and search for photos.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos has been my primary photo editing tool for several years and I've been quite happy with the simple and quick interface for touching up photos. With the latest update, it takes more steps to adjust brightness and color than the old interface, which makes the process frustrating when trying to get things just right. Additionally, the prompts to either save as or overwrite and the vibrate on touch are just annoying features that seem unnecessary. Please bring back the old interface",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the photo storage, and the ability to share pictures with people. The editing features could be better. It would be nice if it had a paste function, so you could put a picture in with another picture. That would make it like a real photo editor. Also, the markup feature needs more colors! I edit pictures all the time on my computer, and I can think of many other features that Google photos is lacking.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall it is a great app. Though, like other people, I have been experiencing problems. One, even though all my photos are backed up and synced, it doesn't show some of my important photos and videos. Next, my photos and videos are scattered, and not in order of how it was in order. I have a couple of other bugs, where it kicks me from the app, just shows a white screen, etc. I still like this app, though it can be better.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Phenomenal little thing that probably does more than it should and a lot of it is superfluous. But Google is smart enough to know to make of it a non-problem because it doesn't actually have any impact on the user. Example: the Assistant-driven features. Stylized photos add a nice touch but I have never used it because all I will at most do to a picture is Enhance and then share/forget. The cool thing is that all these creations live in the Cloud, not taking up my own storage so ""why not?""",

It used to be very simple to switch between photos and albums, but now it is all redesigned to the library tab. I am all for security and bug fixes, though I would have given 5 stars if I could opt out of a UI redesign. IMO, such jarring changes detract from the usability experience customers have become accustomed to over the last few years. Good idea fairies should stay silent and leave well enough alone if the customers are already happy.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. It used to not be very useful to me when it wouldn't allow you to do basic edits like cropping, but now it does!

All around it's a solid app!",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After spending hours of organizing photos on my phone, I turned to google photos to organize my backup photos in the same way using albums. While you can add albums to google photos, the photos in the albums show up in photos tab as well all organized by the date the photo was taken, which makes it difficult to determine what photos are already in albums. Ideally under the photo tab I would like to see all the albums I have and then the photos that have yet to be added into an album. I ended up backing all my photos on a hard drive and deleting all my photos from the app, it just seems too overwhelming to organize photos on my phone as well as the app. I did appreciate that the app did not let you delete photos from your SD card without permission, however I did notice on the site if you deleted a photo that was on the SD card, it continues to show up on the app, but not the website which creates a disconnect from the app and site, creating an even more overwhelming experience when trying to organize photos.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Don't delete images from people's phones woth just a single, short warning. Please, think again about this particular design.

There is no way to search for media unless the app itself has decided what's in the photo (which is wrong on many occasions.) There are other issues that I can't fit in here, but need to be fixed.",

It also prompts you if you have photos that are taking up space that aren't very good, e.g. blurry photos, or screenshots of videogames. Also, there are of course no ads or in-app purchases.

In the album section, it would be nice if only photos that do not belong to any group will be shown. For some with so many albums it's difficult to arrange photos based on albums.",

It does this with no warning and absolutely no way to stop the process once it has started. I'm now sitting here watching my phone upload hundreds of photos and gigabytes of video without my consent, taking up all my bandwidth and absolutely draining my battery. Deleting the album off the phone doesn't stop the process, and turning off data, wi-fi, or the phone only delays it until they are turned back on. Plus Google has helpfully decided to place a banner of ads for their paid printing service right at the top of the library tab, instead of hiding it away in an options menu where it belongs. The average user would, 99.99% of the time, be going to the library tab to find a photo or set of photos to view at the moment, not pay $10 to have a photobook of the pictures printed and mailed to them the next week, so why is it the first thing you see in your library?",

I start searching. Seems like a few people (that I could find) had the same problem. The fix? I had to shut off my wi-fi, turn on the sync over data option, go back in, then it starts syncing, so I turn the wi-fi on again... it goes for about 250-350 photos... so I think... cool - it's working. NOPE. It goes back to the ""preparing backup"" spinning circle of death. So then I do the same thing. And it works again. Then it gets stuck again. So far I think I've done it about 12 or 15 times... and I still have over 2100 photos to do. So - THAT'S annoying. Second... I have to agree with someone else here, on their low review.

I was amazed by this feature which scans your photo content and trys to identify the landmark in the photo. I used it to scan a photo of friend with hill and river inthe background. It correctly identified the location to some place in Canada. 3. Rediscover with Google - This feature wasn't that appealing earlier but the more google rediscovers my past photos timeline, it is helping me to recreate the memory which is the whole purpose of clicking a photo. Well thought! 4. Sharing Albums is so easy. I don't have to struggle sharing mutiple photos (more than 30) on my whts app. It helps you create a link which can be shared with friends &family who can even comment on your photos using this platform.",

5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Photos pairs really well with the Pixel 7 and the features are really cool. However, as someone who likes to take pictures and to have freedom with the pictures I take, Google makes that a rather significant challenge, especially compared to the competition. The device's camera is pretty much the only consideration I make when purchasing a phone. I don't care for Googles storage, which can be turned off, but Pixel 7 is so in-your-face about unwanted storage, it's maddening.",

Add that to the fact that any photos, once removed from your device, only show up in the app and are unable to be found by other applications is completely backwards. Also, why do we have to enable Google Drive sync to find the backed-up photos? The Assistant features in this app are gimmicky and the 'space saving' functionality are wildly broken.",

What I want is very simple and is a return to how things were some three weeks ago. Putting it quite simply, when I open the app, I want to see equal sized thumbnails of my most recent images. I do NOT want to see images of all different sizes - especially when this affects the number visible on the first 'page'. I do NOT want to have to mess about looking in libraries or whatever to see thumbnails. Hopefully you will fix this or at least have it as an option?",

5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great photo app. Easy to search and find photos of anyone/anything - even your pets can be auto-sorted into albums. Great search AI. Wish it had more robust editing features, but that's what other apps are for I guess. Also wish it had better and seamless integration with my laptop. (I miss the old Picassa Windows app.) My main complaint is printing. The cvs/Walgreens/Walmart easy print option is seamless but poor quality. Don't bother.

5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think this is a great app to store photos and to keep them backed up. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I wish I could have the pause and play button on videos next to the bar were it shows the time lapse of the video. The reason being because whenever I try to find a specific frame pressing the pause and play button makes it disappear on the screen and it kinda gets annoying. But other than that it's a great app to store your photos and videos.,

5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the Google Photos app. It is amazing. I especially love the search capabilities. I'd love to see one improvement. You can use the search bar to search by a person's name (if you've assigned a name to a certain face). If you search for two people it will show you every picture that has at least one of those two people it it. I would love it if you could search exclusively for photos with both of those people in it. Like in a normal Google search when you put quotation marks around two or more words to get results that only contain both of those words. It would also be great if this applied to making a photo album based on people. Right now when you create a new album you can make one that adds all of your photos that include one or more people (and continues to automatically add photos of those people to the album as more photos of them are taken). It would be great if you could adjust the settings so that the album only adds photos that include both of these people. It seems like this would only require adding a new database query and a few additions to the front-end. I know you don't want to over complicate the app but I think that this feature would be so cool and useful that it would be worth adding. What couple wouldn't love to put in their names and find all the pictures of them together (without the pictures of each of them individually). Hope to see this in the app someday.,

All saved, camera, downloaded, Instagram saved, Photoshop saved. Right now, PHOTOS section is only camera pics. Hopefully the make these little improvements",

Cloud backups hang forever. Tabs like albums or Assistant take so long to load they might as well be broken. Sharing hangs so long before populating with options that it's unusable. I tried clearing cache, reinstall, etc. All that did was cause google photo to re-sync duplicates of 16,000 photos on my phone to the cloud & of course there's no way to fix that",

That would really help find pictures, wouldn't it? It would also be great to be able to quickly tag multiple photos with categories or keywords. Also, they removed the one click rotate of images, so now you have to edit the image, click rotate, rotate it, click done, then save.
