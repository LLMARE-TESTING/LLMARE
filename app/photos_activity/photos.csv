5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still a good app, but shows a full screen update message every time you open it (exactly 1 month after updating). Also, if you have cloud backup disabled, it sometimes nags you to enable it, and to skip it, you have to restart the app, as saying ""NO"" to it, it will take a random amount of photos and upload them to your cloud anyways. Can you kindly stop with these intrusive messages? Your app works fine as is. What about an option to select the default screen on startup (for example: Library)?",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please. Stop. Replacing. My. Feature. Photos. It's really frustrating when Google keeps changing the feature photo I've set for some people, especially when they change it to a completely different person, and then I have to clear out a bunch of wrong photos to find the one I had previously selected. The feature photo shouldn't change unless I specifically update it. I've already submitted this as ""feedback."" I don't want to submit more screenshots. I just want it fixed, please.",

5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because of the 'Memories' feature. It's such a special and important function for me. But there's two things about using it which frustrate me to no end! 1. No 'delete' option for individual pictures/videos, or the entire 'memory'. 2. No 'move' option for the files/memory, if I want to create a folder or move items to an existing folder. These functions would allow me to tidy my files up a little each day; instead, their absence just causes me daily frustration instead!",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos app is really nice, except for the fact that it's always complaining it needs to update and the app is huge. I'd rather use the memory on photos than on apps, thanks. // Edit: Yes, I have automatic updates disabled. That is why the app detects it is running an ""old"" version and on startup makes a full screen prompt to update, which is ... well, not really usable.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"""Improvements"" to photo editor have made this app unusable. Worst update ever. Uninstall and keep v.4, there is no reason to update this at all, they changed all the photo editing controls, removing the easy to use [color controls combined & lighting controls combined] sliders trying to make it ""better"". Now it's all preset buttons and you can't slide the live editing controls, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Uninstall and reset the app to original version, end of story. Updates only make the ads work",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ridiculous that we can only create albums with an account + sync. Without an account it is a list of system folders with photos. No search, no albums, no grouping or organization feature of any sort, no facial recognition, no features, no nothing. I just wanted to group my photos in albums to download to an HD on the future without using up my Google Drive storage space.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Edit; not a fan of the recent updates and how they've moved around the buttons and changed the layout. It looks a bit clunky and I find myself tapping where things used to be. It's a bit annoying. Also I'm not a fan of these annoying forced app updates. Nobody wants an app to take up MORE space on their phone! There is NO REASON why I needed or wanted to update this app.,
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it ,when they put together photos for video memories. I've ordered photo books too ,you can get hardback or regular . I'm not sure if they offer a disk. That's something I'd love to get .I have to many photos to keep on my phone, putting them on a disk would allow the whole family enjoy them on our big screen tv üòçü§©,and allow me not to have to pay for extra space. Anyone thinking about ordering from Google photos,can be assured that it's quality photos and it's fairly priced too. ENJOY",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app just keeps getting more annoying. I really wish there was a way to roll back to 2019 version. Really frustrating to have ads for a product I pay for constantly presented. Google's response doesn't correspond to any of my issues Redesign is terrible, ads front and center, no way to disable highlights which I don't care about, or the location sucking maps features. Also apparently Google didn't even read the review",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: if I could I would take away the one star because of then ""bot"" feedback. I don't have issues adding photos or achieving them later on. I have a problem that when I'm adding multiple pictures to an album I have to re-sekect then again just to archive. There is not a single ""button"". No option to add photos to a folder and in the same time to archive them. It's primitive and has only very basic options. I'm wondering how productively people can use it to manage their collection of photos.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whatever's happened in the most recent update has knackered the ability to add text to images in the editing features. I can get the words on the image but controlling the location and sizing has become a pain. Assuming this is investigated and fixed, it would be nice to see the text autofill the box size fully rather than just on height. Otherwise it's a decent photo storage app and I'm quite happy using it.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly good, but I have 2 main issues. Navigation to albums is made more difficult that it needs to be; or should be. Instead of a single press to get to an album menu (navigable from the bottom bar) this app desires that you should navigate to library, and then select on all albums if the album you seek isn't within the first handful of options. Not good. The app also keeps begging me to ""backup my photos to drive"", despite having selected no. Remember my choice, and stop trying to steal data",
5-Jan-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really wish there was a way to redownload backed up photos and videos in bulk. There are many gallery-cleaning apps that allow you to go through your camera roll and swipe to delete/keep items, which is something I really need because I'm running out of storage, but they can only access local files and the majority of my images are stored in the cloud instead of my device. Alternatively, if the app had a built-in sorting feature. Except for that, it's great!",

Observed this behavior acrose at least three different phones (pixel 4, 5 and 8 pro).

One major bug I've encountered that hard-locks the Google photos app, is using the Audio eraser feature on a Video Boosted video.

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Takes away control. ""Features"" are forced on you even when you expressly turn them off. With back up turned off it'll still back up photos if you move them to an album. Albums are a painful experience in and of themselves. The UI is a mess, not intuitive in the slightest. Going into the cloud to examine and organize is extremely slow even on fast home internet or 5G. Adding features is fine just stop anticipating what I want and let me control my own device and photos, stop controlling me.",

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is a fairly good program but there are a couple of things that really bugs me: - it keeps backing up my screenshots even though I have nothing ticked in the backup settings = just the camera roll should be backed up - looking at my photos in Google photos on my phone, I can't delete a picture from Google photos, without also deleting it from my device. - face recognition, it is not possible to tell the app that that this is person A not B.

Overall I hate this app. But it is the only app I have to store photos, videos, ect.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"An okay app but deliberately uses underhanded tactics to push unwanted features. Best example is the backup feature. Turning off automatic backup means receiving reminders to backup regularly.

To undo the action one must log on with a computer and delete items individually (no ""select all"" present). Sketchy practices from a sketchy company.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really annoying app, first, what dictates a photo being in the ""Photos' section and not the Library? Feels random and I don't feel in control of it. Second, when I turn off backup I did it because I wanted to, why keep asking to turn it on? Then when I say I don't want to back up, it then prompts again to back up manually with a load of images pre-selected, I'm pretty sure I said no?! Nowwhere in settings to stop this. Pretty infuriating.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was really disappointed when I found out tagging is not allowed. This feature is really basic and all other apps have that. We have a lot of images and we need to find them fast. That's what tagging is for. Not a lot of time is spent on making the app. It's just made for money. :( Update: you cannot even email any photos by tapping share. It's getting worse. Update: you can't even copy a photo easily on this app. Very unorganized! Getting worse! It deletes your photos without permission. üò≠,
5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Buggy and intrusive. If you only want some photos backed up, forget about it. Even with cloud backups disabled, Photos will still crawl through every folder on your phone to find photos, then back them up to the cloud without your permission. There is no way to disable this. For Google Home devices, photo frame capabilities are very problematic. Albums will refuse to update when more photos are added. Newer albums won't even show up as selectable.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok, but the search capabilities are very limited, coming from Google. Advanced users should be able to create more capable searches, such as finding pictures taken by camera X or Y, or finding pictures that are in the intersection of 2 albums, or searching the difference between albums, finding pictures that count towards your quota vs not, filter by backup quality...

5-Jan-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe you guys got rid of one of the most useful features of the app - the map. It was super easy to find a photo if you knew where it was taken, by looking at the map and picking it out from the location. Not surprising though, Google always kills off the most useful features. It's like you get pleasure from it. You guys were cool when you had the ""Don't Be Evil"" motto.",

No, this trash app put them in a folder and not the main album. The memories tab is also useless and shouldn't be forced. I don't care about several random Facebook photos from five years ago being spotlit for no reason other than the date. Also, transparent PNGs end up in a weird black box instead of transparent. Don't respond.",
5-Jan-24,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is one of the best apps for photos. Live album is too good. It recognizes photos from the camera store and organises in the album without an error. I have my kids album and anytime i click a new photo it is able to to select her pic and add to album. Update : One more feature should be added. It should segregate photos which are not part of any album. It will be easier to clear clutter.,

I also wish Photos didn't keep trying to ""back up"" EVERYTHING from my phone! I want photos on my phone's SD card kept separate from the few I manually upload to Photos. Worse, if you use Photos to delete a photo on the phone, it doesn't go into (restorable) phone trash but a weird Photos deleted folder. And DON'T hit the ""eject SD card"" button in Photos!
