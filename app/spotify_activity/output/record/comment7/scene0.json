And no option for playing one song on repeat. I cant even listen to a particular part of any song, no matter what, if I want to listen to any part again I'll have to start over again with the song. I even tired to update it but no change.I hate this app so much now\u5192\u807c\u8075\u9647. It's the same thing again even after I have updated it 2 times.\u5192\u807c\u9647\u5362",
