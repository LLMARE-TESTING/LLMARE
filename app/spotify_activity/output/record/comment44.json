There should really be an option to turn it off permanently not just with the shuffle button it turns of randomly and doesn't find songs close enough for my playlists Sounds nit-picky and maybe it is but I liked Spotify a lot more before this feature was added. It might work for some people so I don't think it should be removed just a more permanent was to turn it off in like options or something",
