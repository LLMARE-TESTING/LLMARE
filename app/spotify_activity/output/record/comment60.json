You have to stoop so low that you disable the basic features of a music platform app. You can't go to a specific part of a song, you can't even select the previous song and many more. For using the basics, one has to buy the premium. You have the ad promo but this recent update you are using cheap tactic. I don't even want to give one star but this is the least i can go down as compared to what your team did.",
