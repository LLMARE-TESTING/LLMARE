        "comment": "I've been a customer for years and I like the music availability as well as the algorithm for new song recommendations. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. I like how easy it is to make collaborative playlists. I am very displeased with the shuffle function as it always plays the same songs in the same order no matter what I do, and that is making my experience dull and disappointing. If shuffle were fixed, I'd rate 5 stars.",
