These are basic features of a music app, but now you have to pay for them. So bad. Free music with ads is still tolerable and understandable, but this stunt is so cheap. I have been using Spotify for about 3 years and considered it the finest music app. But no, it's absolutely disgusting now. Uninstalling it on the way.",
