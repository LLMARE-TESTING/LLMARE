        "comment": "For the sake of selling premium membership of the app, they made it a radio system at least radio has features that you can change channel everytime you want. But in Spotify for every damn feature you need premium whether it about skipping the song or choosing the song you want to hear. You can only listen what they want you to listen. You can only skip 6 times a day only. You cannot arrange the sequence. There is more negative reviews to add. Well extremely disappointed.",
