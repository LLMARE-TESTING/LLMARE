No matter what you click, the app randomly does one of the following: Play a random episode from a podcast (starting at a random time), pause, or skip to the next episode. No button does what its supposed to. Its impossible to select episodes or even pause (the pause button also does one of the random actions listed previously). Outside of driving mode the app functions normally. UPDATE: Tried to contact Spotify support as requested, only AI support is available.",
