        "comment": "The new version of this app is extremely irritating. Queue option ,forward song option and some more features have now gone to premium and you need to click each song for listening it and also you cannot jump to some part of the song you love. All features where there in this app before update but now it is nothing more than pathetic. I'll recommend not to use this app if you like to listen music because very soon you'll get irritated .",
