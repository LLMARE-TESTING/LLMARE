Like Button Issues; Adding songs is the same in the new update, but un-adding is NOT. You have to click the checkmark to open playlists, uncheck liked songs, and click done. It went from one tap to three taps, including an extra menu. Seriously, how in the world am I supposed to do that while driving? You made things more difficult for absolutely no reason. You marketed it as the same experience with an extra feature, but in reality, it is NOT the same experience. Absolutely terrible change.

The app is trash! Buggy interface, the video feed randomly disappears.. have to 'force stop' atleast once per week. I've subscribed for years, waiting for improvements. Millions earned but no updates? Shame is due.
