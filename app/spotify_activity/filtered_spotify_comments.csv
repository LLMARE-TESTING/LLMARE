20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, I have Spotify premium and the benefits are great. All the features are great. But the app itself could use some work, certain glitches or errors in certain features effect the listeners experience in a negative way. For example, the jam feature, where 2 or more people can listen from different devices at the same time, it's a great feature. It's a great way to feel connected through music. But whenever you add a song, or the host adds a song, the song glitches",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, great features. One seriously aggravating problem: if I don't turn on shuffle, I don't want it on shuffle. I don't think it should be assumed that people want something mixed or a single played song. That's how my Spotify opens every time and it's terrible. Other than that, it's a phenomenal app and I would still recommend it to people.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Spotify is my main music app, and my most preferred, it gives me good suggestions and aligns with my mood quite well. it's a great music app overall, with amazing UI, nice features, and the most accurate Radios I've experienced through all the music apps I've tried. Aside from the features locked to premium, the lyrics are not a premium feature and doesn't even attempt to load the lyrics any further once it doesn't the first time. and it's annoying since it works when it wants to work.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use it for both music and podcasts and either way I hate the way the queue works. Or actually doesn't work . It took me ages to find the tab for it, which I stumbled in accidentally. And the way it so easily drops downloads! And I can't figure out why if I try to play an album it switches back to a podcast after one song! The solution was to clear my podcast queue. NO!!!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love Spotify, and have for years. HOWEVER... my only beef is that while the app WILL technically run in the background, if the app is not front-and-center screen, it will randomly cut out and stop. I use my phone for Uber navigation, so Spotify cannot be the diva on screen, so it will constantly throw a hissy fit and stop if this is the case. Very annoying to have to constantly fiddle with my phone to re-open the app window and restart my music. Other than that, Spotify is the best music app!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love Spotify. I use it almost every day and I have the premium account which I enjoy. But, I have been having issues with the podcasts. When I click my headphone button to resume where I left off, it hardly works. I go into the app, and like some reviews have said I get a black screen, and timestamp is sometimes 0:00 and the play button is unresponsive. I have to force quit the app. Very, very annoying. Also, the shuffle button for music SUCKS. May as well be called the ""reorganize"" button.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Spotify and paying premium for about eight years now. The experience, however, only worsens. The app is bloated and sluggish on mobile. I have to fight device selection, smart shuffle and background requests to features I have no interest in like videos, lyrics and band info. This used to be a solid music player. Now it is an app that tries to do a dozen other things by compromising on the main functionality. I'm organizing myself to move away from this bloated mess.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Do not use this app for podcasts. It does all the standard stuff you'd want for music, plain and dry, but its podcast features are an absolute mess. More headache than its worth, especially with much better alternatives on the market. The podcasts on here break the app literally every time it's used, and the only fix is to force stop the app. Every time. Any time. If you pause the app once, because you had to do something quick, expect another force shut down. Simply don't get this for podcasts",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Spotify used to be great. So great that I got the premium. With recent updates, the UI changed drastically, in my oppinion for the better. New features that were really cool and useful for people who liked to expand their tastes. But now, the app doesn't work half the time. It freezes constantly and lags so bad that I'm here writing this review to tell Spotify this: FIX THIS ASAP.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Spotify Premium for almost ""4 Years"" that a very long time,I can say that, It was one of the best and my favourite music application. On the other hand they also added podcast but I never liked listening podcast in Spotify .But from last one year, I started experiencing bugs, lags ,crashes and also some unwanted recommendations, which is ruining my experience. And as they are trying to add more and more features ,user interface getting complicated and ruining user experience.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works well for the most part. The shuffle feature(s) tend to be repetitive depending on the song one starts with. Also, since the last patch,the app doesn't sync with my vehicles Bluetooth: always ""there is no song info available"" where before there had never been a problem. It's also bugging out on my phone and displaying incorrect information when I play anything: wrong song titles, artists etc.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new widget is far too large and can't be shrunk. The 4Ã—1 widget was perfect. Making the smallest one a 3Ã—2 (which can be widened to 4Ã—2) means it doesn't fit in my typical layout. It takes up more space and offers the same amount of controls. It's frankly moronic. Fix this absolute nonsense and bring back the 4Ã—1 or at least let us shrink it back.,,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest update made it impossible to listen to podcasts while driving. It no longer pauses the podcast while the Google maps navigation voice talks. So I miss part of the show and have to rewind 15 seconds. I talked to support and they just said ""that's a new feature."" And ""switch to using Waze"" I'm very disappointed and may have to cancel my premium plan if this isn't fixed. Basically made it worthless for me as I listito podcasts while driving.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I completely stopped using Spotify after they decided to remove basic features (like playing just the songs in a playlist) inorder to make their premium offering more attractive. That is not how you encourage someone to try out your subscription. It's digital extortion at its worst. And Guess what, it's been about 6 months since I stopped using it and the world hasn't come to an end. Well what do you know!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I feel like the app is pushing sparkly functions but not very helpful ones. I'd like my car view back to easily skip or pause songs with a huge button, for example. You can make it optional for people who drive a car with fancy media function. Or fix shuffle. Or show saved playlists on the first screen vs in a tab you need to look for. Those kinda things. Thanks!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good and has compatibility with tons of other tools and apps just by virtue of popularity. Though theres some of quality of life issues I wish would get addressed, and it feels like each UI update has something mildly annoying to add. For instance I wish it didn't take 3 button presses to simply unlike a song. It would be nice to be able to pin folders within folders, and not automatically shuffle or loop albums saved in folders.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Something has happened where auto play, even though it's on, does not work. If I search a song and click on it, after it ends it either doesn't play anything or replays the same song over and over. Repeat button is not highlighted. It has been doing this for the last month or so. I have an android phone. I don't want to delete and reinstall the app because I have ove 300 songs downloaded.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't listen to a whole album without it changing to a song from a completely different album. Have to pay for basic feature like shuffle/playing songs in order or skipping more than 5-6 time a day. Can barely play podcasts anymore, WHICH WAS THE MAIN REASON I GOT IT. What makes this worse is that youtube has all these ""features"". You can skip, easily make a playlist of anything, and PICK THE ORDER OF SONGS YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO. How is it better than the app specifically made for music?",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a music streaming app, the streaming part is just bad. Even with a stable internet connection, my music is intermittent... its infuriating. More so, it seems to always think that the app is set to offline when it is not. The app worked fine before... what have you devs done to screw it up? Changed from 2 to 1 star. Now it won't even play downloaded songs properly.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'd been using an older version of the app for months because it worked perfectly. It let me pick as many songs as I wanted, skip as many times as I wanted, and it ran smoothly. The other day, I wanted to change my profile photo and the button to change it just.. disappeared? And no matter what I did it wouldn't show up so I had no other option but to update to the latest version and honestly, I could've done with not changing my picture. Limited everything, trash interface, and much slower.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is getting desperate. Why are basic features, like playing a song you want to listen to or even just rewinding a song, to be paid for? It's become more of a money grab than a music app. It was all tolerable till a little long ago; only things that were premium were ads and ofcourse offline music. But now, we only have ""6 skips an hour"", and I can't even tell if I'm listening to music with ads or the otherway round. Please work things out to the consumers and owner's convenience.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It would be cool if the shuffle feature actually shuffled. It doesn't matter what song I start it on, if I hit ""shuffle"" it plays the same songs, in the same order, every time. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of the shuffle. I already had issues with this app not feeling super user friendly and this just makes it worse. I may go back to my old streaming service because it just ruins the experience for me.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since an update a few months ago it's been so slow and unresponsive. When I want to keep listening to music that I was listening to earlier, if I try to continue playing it, it'll just lag and then just disappear so I then have to go back into my playlist and click shuffle again, and keep spamming the button until it actually starts playing. This never happened before, it would just start playing music where I left off, no matter how long it had been idle. There's other problems too I'm sick of",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spotify keeps stopping music play (even though I pay for premium). Mid-song, it will just stop playing music and I have to pause the song and resume it again to continue listening until the bug hits again. This has been happening frequently the past month or so. I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it twice now, but the bug eventually comes back inevitably. This NEEDS to get fixed or I'm switching to Apple Music.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"That DJ AI is perfect with only odd, going off, if something doesn't take your interest, it's bound to put something on that might do. Flows too. I find Spotify is missing categories, so it's impossible to find stuff from a certain category if not in the related section. Which in turn, could help undiscovered artists or new ones set up their stands. The music quality is pretty good and the app runs well. I've had a bug when a track is on repeat. The skip function breaks down on the player.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Music is good. The shifting ""shelves"" of topics constantly changing is annoying. Wanted to listen to some new albums in the ""New albums for you"" section, the section disappeared after only selecting one. Display all the types of shelves and let the user customize their position in settings and it would be better. Update 3/14/24 When I select ""shuffle"", I want to shuffle my whole Playlist, or an artists whole discography, not the 12 song I've listened to the most, and not their top 5 songs.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app has made it difficult for me to play musice that I like. I can't skip foward and rewind music to my liking, just click on any song I want, and I can't seem to handle the ads. Spotify should let the free users have the same premium features without paying for it. Also, they're taking out half the songs that were on there, now I can't listen to half the things I like. Their feedbacks are the same everytime and they won't change anything. Please change things. I don't want to pay for music",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Vastly inferior to the desktop version of the app. Some features from desktop are locked behind a Premium subscription on the mobile version, such as basic functionality like playing an album (sometimes it just plays suggested similar songs instead of songs from the album you pressed play on). Also, I have frequent issues where playlists just unexpectedly stop after a few songs, which doesn't make me want to subscribe.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really unhappy with how treats online/offline. If I've got a downloaded playlist and my wi-fi isn't connected, in online mode it will stop between songs. Works fine in offline mode. If I'm in offline mode and I pick an online feature (eg DJ) it just spins. I can't even get to settings or the back button. I gave to stop the app. So I'm constantly going back and forth between online and offline modes, which takes a lot of strokes and scrolls. Also don't like how it handles podcasts.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you don't have Spotify Premium its horrible use Youtube instead. If you do have Premium, then its a great app to listen music to and has many options, lots of great quality of life features and integrations with your devices that it is nice to just quickly pop open whenever (or instantly continue what you were listening to before if you don't fully close the app) and listen to your favorite songs. Although you really have to get Premium for it to be any good.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Playlists will play the same 30 odd songs. Artists that have clearly paid the most money to appear on everyone's feed show up consistently while scrolling through main feed. Spotify ""Jam"" feature does not work at all, any time a person pauses and restarts a song it glitches and will pause playback immediately after pressing play button. AI DJ is a feature with much potential but plays the same 30 odd songs, as well as a few new ones. Overall quality has plummeted.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've tried a few other music services and this android app is now probably the best of the bunch as far as stability. However, the music service is near the bottom. Worst of the bunch maybe. It's all due to the forced ""made for you"" feature. It just ends up playing the same handful of songs no matter where you go, it seems. The algorithms most likely just limits the royalties Spotify has to pay to artists while limiting the variety of songs and the possibility of discovering new music.",,,

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good app but after the new update the control panel on mobile during background play freezes constantly, and no longer lets you go back or forward on your audio using the slider. This is on the premium version. Hope it gets fixed soon. Offline features are also not working as well as they were. Why update if youre just going to make everything worse???",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App has gone downhill in the past few updates. Adding new songs to playlists is difficult and tends to cause the app to freeze up and crash. It is very difficult to navigate to different songs or playlists due to the app lagging. The offline feature doesn't work anymore and music I have downloaded can't be played. This was never an issue in the past.,,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was good, but now it won't work. At all. Last time it kicked me out my account after months so I made a new one, it was good for a while now it won't let me play ANYTHING, and I have playlists, but Spotify got rid of that play? button so now I can't play any songs. But I 'can add songs onto my playlists' but spotify won't even show me the songs that are on there already. Nothing works anymore and I can't use it. It keeps saying that playing a song is a premium feature when obviously it isnt..",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Spotify has steadily declined over the last ~2.5 years. The worst is their AI shuffle, which overplays your favorite songs until you hate them or only ever plays the same 10 songs that you heard the first time you shuffled a playlist. This can't be turned off. Songs will randomly pause and claim they're still playing. The ""download music"" feature almost never works when I actually don't have service and need it. Every time I open the app, it says I don't have internet and spazzes out. Use Apple.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate the free Spotify but it's the only thing I have as I'm too poor for premium currently (I'm being serious too), and the ads SUCK.

20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is usually brilliant. Recently it has started to play up. The player will randomly pause whatever you're listening to, while still displaying a ""pause"" button, indicating that the player believes is it playing. You have to pause, then play again. In the grand scheme of things it's not a huge issue, but can be very annoying when working with both hands. Device is a Pixel 5.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new update. The removal of the like button has made everything worse from sorting out songs to figuring out which ones I like or haven't listened to yet, and now I don't know. I was enjoying Spotify on my Chromebook because it had the like button, and made everything easier to sort and quick to see what songs I already listened to \ liked. Now I have to click every, single, song to see if I listened to it or not. Also, be nicer to non-premium users",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Spotify is total garbage for listening to podcasts. You can't access premium subscriptions of podcasts; it will show an episode that you're in the middle of on your home screen, but when you click on it, it doesn't take you to that episode. There's no option on the app for an entire list of just songs of an artist- you have to go in and out of albums; sometimes an album won't even be listed on an artist's page - you have to search for it directly. That's just a FEW issues & SUPER glitchy lately.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Auto plays randomly with a BT connected. This has been a long-standing issue. I'll be on a phone call and when the call disconnects Spotify automatically plays. Even though I was not using the app. There's a bunch of proposed fixes online but none of them work.

Like nowadays when I put my playlist, it plays some random songs that I've never had of and worst thing is I can't even skip them. When I search a song, it brings some random order of songs before it gets to the one I want to listen to. It's becoming useless",,,

However on a phone, you cannot skip songs like on other devices and there is an ad every 2 songs. I use Spotify on a laptop and on a tablet so I'm loving it there but it's useless on a phone.

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update is not at all worth.Even listening to songs of our own choice is under premium .Spotify WAS a good app.This app is not allowing music to range in queue. it loses the interest of listening the songs back to back .Even this is not at all encouraging to buy premium.Instead frustrated to shift the Playlist on other music apps.The market spotify had established is just lost because of this very update.The very purpose for which music apps are made is defeated with such an update!Worst app ever,,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm changing my 5 star review to 2 stars because of these reasons. 01. I'm a premium user since years, and sometimes the shuffle button broke. It always enables the recommended songs to my Playlist even I turn it off. It's very frustrating. 02. Ordering a Playlist is broke and the app is messing the order by it self. This is definitely BugSpotify now.",,,

I just wanna say that if you keep on blocking free features thinking they'll buy premium, no one will download this app and move on to other apps. And I noticed that we had a free window for infinite skip, infinite song selection, and now it's all gone to the drain and really frustrates people. Hope this helps you to not choose this app.",,,

Songs I dislike keep getting recommended or added to playlists. 2.) why are there still ads in podcasts when you pay for premium? 3.) offline mode frequently has issues. It should not be so difficult to listen to downloaded music. 4.)the new front page endless scroll is a nightmare. Only really use my desktop now. 5.) Frequently have to go and redo my settings, updates seem to undo selections I made previously.",,,

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At first it was just annoying because of ads..but now it's impossible to use. You can't change song as much as much as u want only 6 skips per hour u can't play song as u want it will shuffle according to them... Idk what's wrong with them .. My Reccomendation if u want to listen ad free and want to have every premium feature without paying go and install Spotify mod.. Or any other app. U will get many and they are really very good,,,

There's also a recently played history (38 song for mobile) feature that can be really helpful when you're wanting to build a playlist but don't want to/can't add songs one at a time as they play (like if you're driving or just want to loose yourself in groove) Also the recent update to how you add songs to a playlist is phenomenal!

Starting a local jam seems be doable only at random with a popup. Queue has problems - no play last option, so if you're listening to an album, you have to wait until that one is done before adding the next album, otherwise you will just inject a whole album between two songs of your current album.

Finally decided to uninstall the app and start using downloaded songs.",,,

We all know about Spotify!! ðŸ˜ But, I think Spotify should have player shortcut in lock screen and other places which will be customised by Spotify, not by system. I am not saying that it hasn't any player appearance. It has, but it's not so convenient for me which is provided by my device's system. Player shortcut should include ""add favourite"" button, shuffle button. That's all.",,,

20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been a Spotify premium subscriber for over 6 years, and I love the service, but the user interface has gotten so bad over the years that I'm thinking of switching to Amazon music. You can't find anything, ever, it is so congested with content with no order whatsoever. You can never find Discover Weekly or queue up a playlist, and now they changed the method for liking songs. They overcomplicated it when it could be simple, seamless, and minimal. What are you guys doing over there, Spotify?",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had five stars earlier but now I edited and changed it to one! Yes! 'cause the updates are way too annoying and it certainly deserved it.

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The updates are just stupid. There is no point in using this app without premium.

Every time I cycle through, it turns itself back on and I have to turn it off twice. I hate it! And what idiot decided the + button should direct to whatever playlist you added to last?

Even if you hide something, it can still show up when it plays recommended songs. They doesn't respect us",,,

Apparently Spotify has decided this wasn't enough and now forces this on us.",,,

Please remove that spotify, it's honestly the most useless update you have ever added",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The free version feels less like they're keeping away features so premium could have them and more like they're purposely removing features to push you to get premium. I mean, you can't turn off shuffle, you can't remove the songs that are forced into your playlists (even if it says they aren't there, after 5 songs, they appear), you can't just normally listen to an artists album because it just plays random bs, and so much more. What's even stranger is that only mobile is affected by this bs.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointed with the latest update. It has removed all the basic features like shuffle mode, loop mode, has locked the lyrics for free users and doesn't allow you to play a particular part of the song, you can only listen from the beginning to the end. Also, you can only choose to play a few songs a day! There's even a limit to skipping to the next song. Like seriously for real??

(2) same goes for the equalizer but maybe place it as part of the kebab button/options menu on a song. Thank you! Fingers crossed u consider",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't love to play Spotify anymore. I was okay with not forwarding and rewinding feature but this is too much I even can't get to choose songs from my playlist and only get limited skips for songs unless I buy premium service.

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shifting to Youtube Music. Spotify you have been worse than a disappointment. Used to love this app. Disappointed that skipping to a part of a song and going back has been made a ""premium"" feature. These are basic requirements of a music app.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Needs A WAY TO LOCC a PLAYLIST so that you can't ACCIDENTALLY CHANGE IT!!! ALSO make it where we can picc more than ONE genre of liked music (at the top of liked menu) sometimes i wanna listen to rocc & rap...i may wanna listen to slow and smooth. ALSO MAKE IT WHERE ONCE SOMETHING has been queued and PLAYED it gets put properly in the previous song position the works but you'll get higher when you fix these problems,,,

The basic features of a music app have been removed from the app for those who use it for free.

I have to reach all the way to top left corner and click the down arrow or hit the back button. Iphone you can do it, Android you can't.

I installed it on 3 different operating systems, and they all have problems with basic shuffle play!! Shuffle play won't turn on, or won't turn off, will play the same group of songs over and over (instead of the entire playlist). I (wildly) assume there is a lot of corruption in their company because I have been using Spotify for years and they never fixed shuffle play. It such a simple feature. Why not fix it?",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I think one of the worst features that spotify has rolled out and has really degraded the experience for me is the smart shuffle. The fact that there isn't an option to disable it and that you're forced to cycle through that option when you're switching through the shuffle options is ridiculous. I also find that the feature will just turn on by itself and I'll have to go in and manually turn it off which is not ideal especially when I'm driving. I don't think anyone asked for this feature.,,,

They just made all basic features paid. This is not how a music app works. Rated 1 star, and uninstalled Spotify, will never install it untill they remove all these unnecessary restrictions. Shame of Spotify! Very disappointed. It was my fav. App for more than 2 years.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spotify appears relentless in its pursuit of monetizing every facet of its service. With its latest update, the company has taken a regrettable turn, significantly compromising the overall user experience. This is primarily due to an increase in the frequency of advertisements, making the free tier more intrusive, and encouraging users to opt for the premium subscription just to gain the basic functionality of switching between songs without interruptions. It's basically trash now.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The notification and history button keep disappearing from home. I wish queueing were easier. You can't queue songs to play next; they can only be added to the very end, so you have to slowly drag it to wherever you want them to be. And it's so easy to accidentally play a song on your queue when modifying it and erasing all the songs that were supposed to play before it. It'd also be nice if we could tell the app to play random songs from multiple albums/playlists we select.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've loved this app for about a year (premium specifically). But recent updates have made the app almost annoying to use. For one, a feature that I adored has been removed. Is that being a pop-up if a song is already in your playlist and the ""skip songs already in playlist?"" option. That was probably my favorite thing about this streaming specifically. Making a playlist was fun and easy with that feature. If it changes back I'll definitely update this review,but until then it's becoming annoying",,,

Tracks don't skip forward or back very well, it crashes from time to time, sometimes it just goes silent and I have to skip, and then pause and play for it to work again. The like button keeps changing to a tick where you can add it to multiple playlists but that just isn't helpful because now I can't easily see what I have liked or not.",,,

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Adds random songs to your custom playlists and doesn't allow you to play your playlist in order without buying premium. On top of that, you can't skip more than six times without getting premium, so you can't listen to what you want without giving them money. Just use YouTube. Spotify has somehow managed to be even more greedy than them. Could also use a ""stop"" feature. It's really annoying having to play something different and come back to the song or playlist to restart it. Horrible app.",,,

The addition of the smart shuffle is extremely annoying, I activated it on accident and now I have to press the shuffle button multiple times when I want to shuffle and wait 30 seconds for it to load every single time just so it can add songs that I don't want? You should be able to disable it completely, I will never want to use it.",,,

20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app has become worse than ever. LITERALLY you can't even change from where the song is playing. If by mistake I choose another song I have to listen it again. They removed the basic features of Spotify and shifted it to Premium. First of all ads are of 1 and a half minute but I didn't bother that much but now it's too much. I have been using this app for 4 years but now it has disappointed me a lot.

NoW, even the basic features(like playing back to back, on loop etc.) are only available for the premium users, you can't even 'Tap & Play' the songs you like to listen..after some 5 or 6 songs it starts playing some randomass songs you can't even skip back or forth!

Basic features such as being to loop your songs and being able to listen one song multiple times in a day have all been taken away and made premium. You can't go to certain parts of the song or remove shuffle from your playlist without having premium.

Every feature is being transferred to the premium version and there are ads after every 1 or 2 songs. When I listen to the songs in my playlist, random songs start playing. I can't even skip it because apparently I can only skip 6 songs every hr forcing me to listen to songs I don't even like. I'm really disappointed in what Spotify has done and I'm sure many other people also are.",,,

So you can see why I'd get annoyed, if your gonna yap my ears off. At least let me know what your advertising to me. Also, if I get ANY Christmas adds in November. I'm not gonna be happy.

The plus of free audiobooks is nice but cuts off after so many hours. What's the point of pushing that when there is a free option with the library. It was just nice not having to float between apps. Make this truly unlimited. Sounds like the free version is basically Pandora (yikes). Disappointed to see where this app has gone.,,,

What was once a great free service has now become a shadow of its former self, buried under an avalanche of premium promotions.

I loved the features like repeat, even now some songs are also added in premium section and you can't even get lyrics for some songs maybe the worst update for spotify ever.ðŸ™ðŸ˜”",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst of all music apps! I was using Spotify since last many years but they are now forcing the customers to buy their premium plan by limiting the basic features in free version!! Like you can't choose more than 6 songs in a day to play of your choice and many more conditions are being applied with the aim that the consumers will buy the premium. And so I just uninstalled it! But otherwise the UI , UX and overall tech experience is good!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is was a good app. I spent my time with this app bcas hearing music comforts me. But after recent subscription and without subscription users features change. Change the name to ""Spotify only for premium"". The rewind option and play it in a list is this features worth the subscription!! I'm uninstalling the app. It's complete useless app fro users using without subscription bcas the song everytime u have select and play in the like song lists this itself makes us feel even more exhausting.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Frustrated with Recent Updates."" Spotify was once my go-to music app, but recent changes have left me frustrated and disappointed. The app now restricts basic playback features, demanding a premium subscription for what used to be standard functionality. This move feels like a push for more revenue rather than providing a user-friendly experience. Spotify, please reconsider these change and prioritize user satisfaction.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop shoving podcasts down my throat if I can't even play them. Get it off my home page. This retarded dev team won't fix issues that have been widespread for three years. When we use offline mode, hundreds of hours of music that have been downloaded for years WILL NOT PLAY. There is even an icon signifying the songs, playlists, and albums are downloaded. Use a different service. This trash has been constant with this company. With the last update, songs suddenly skip now, too. 11/10/23 trash",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was best before but now it has became the worst music app i have ever experienced. Now it doesn't even allow you to play a specific part of the song,it only lets you play at suffle mode and it does not allow you to skip songs more than 5 times a day and its like spotify is controlling everything and doesn't allow you to do any thing. It keeps on forcing to buy their premium but we will never if they dont upgrade their free features. I better delete this app and switch. Same on you spotify!!!",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Spotify app's user interface feels like a labyrinth designed by someone with a vendetta against simplicity. Navigating through the chaos of playlists and recommendations is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and don't even get me started on the incessant ads that make a root canal seem enjoyable in comparison. It's a masterclass in frustration and a testament to how a once-promising music platform can become a digital headache.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spotify has been my main music app for years, but recently it's been progressively getting worse and worse. usually, now the app just won't load in. I'll completely close and restart the app,and it doesn't change anything. if the main page does load and I go to my liked (and all downloaded) songs, the page won't load either. I'll close the app and do it again, and nothing happens. I can repeat this for who knows how long. sometimes I end up giving up and using YouTube instead again like old days",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a Premium subscriber for the better part of 4 years, but I can't support how much the free experience is being sabotaged. Taking away basic features like queueing, looping, etc. and not even having ways to lower ads like sponsored ad-free music segments that other apps have, and Spotify ITSELF has in other countries, is shameful. Greed really caused this once excellent app to fall off a cliff.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It has potential but you need premium to get the good features. Even with premium, I'm still having trouble with the app. I used offline mode while I travel for work and half the time my playlists won't play. I tried listening to a podcast and I get ""playback failed"" even though the episode is downloaded to my phone. What's the point of using extra space in my storage if it won't work when I need it to?",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps getting worse and worse. Who's idea was it to get rid of the like button? Dumbest thing I've ever seen. Since the last update I've been having a consistent problem with Spotify telling me there's no internet connection when there definitely is. Also, love the concept of the daily drive mix but for the love of all that is holy will you please fix the algorithm?? It plays seriously the same songs Every. Single. Day.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but needs some work. The feature of liking songs connected to adding to a playlist make it very difficult to understand which songs you've liked and further confuses your library. You also cannot just see which songs you've liked when scrolling through a playlist. The liked song ""playlist"" also could use some work. There are no options to add all of your liked songs to another playlist, and you can't select the songs and add them that way. You can only do that on desktop.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good app, but I'm tired of music recommendations that I'm not interested in, and podcasts that I've listened to one time, continually showing up on my homepage. I don't understand why Spotify doesn't have a clear history or reset preferences option. If you play a song for a friend, then that genre or playlist will plague you forever.",,,
20-Mar-24,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Spotify has come up with a new update...i don't know why for most of the songs lyrics aren't available and its the most annoying thing ever...and that makes me this app a lot!! And even the new feature that u can't go back to the previous song and u can't even select or go back to your fav part of the song its the worst!!! I hope spotify restores its old features back soon or else i have to switch to some other music platforms!! Thank youu!,,,
