Now I have to scroll for like 5 minutes just to find the episode I was actively listening to. It doesn't bring you to the last episode you were listening to even if you didn't finished it. It will also play and episode with no sound for minutes and the only way to get it to stop the silent playing is to re start the app. Very frustrating. üëé üëé üëé,,,

Even if I go to switch their positions, I hit save and they end up back to where they started.

Every time I open the app it starts playing a random track from a random artist that, often, I've never heard of. No setting to disable that.

The widget doesn't appear on my lock screen anymore, which defeats the purpose of me using the app because I can't always be on my phone changing what plays through the app. I also can't use my headphone controls like I could.

And no videos only 5 Seconds replay. YouTube music free is much better. The only good thing Spotify has over YouTube is that you can close the phone and can go to different apps. Not to much ads.,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,First this app was so nice..but eventually this app became an app just to hear ads..I can't even listen to songs what I like..they are only focusing on promoting their app..there is no options for basic users..in their pre-planned playlist some songs are not even played and some are repeatedly playing..it's really terrible..even I cant skip more than 6 time..I just have to hear what they play..some times I just have to hear a same song so multiple times..actually this app has became really worst,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Great for music but the constant adverts on podcasts when I have a premium sub are infuriating so I will not be renewing my subscription. Get ninety percent through an audiobook then it says you are out of time. Another scam to get more money off you & constantly pauses when playing . What's the point in downloading songs if you can't listen without internet?Without a sub postcode lottery ads are the most annoying thing in the world. Is this the plan to try and force people to subscribe?,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Paying 10$ just to listen to music is not worth it when you can just download it as a mp4 for free and how if you choose a song to listen to you have to listen to other 50 different songs to listen to that 1 song you chose for.

My Student Plan lapsed because I didn't verify it for the upcoming school year which I understand. What I don't understand is why they changed my account from the $5.99+ Student Plan I was on to the $10.99+ Premium Plan without once consulting me. It's not even necessarily about the money I just don't like corporations feeling like they can help themselves to more of my money without asking first. Customer support wasn't much help.,,,

I gave them a ideaüò≥) and that's why there rates are becoming low and low. And i want to say that this app is now a timepass.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not a bad music app. Just don't understand why the app can add song to your liked playlist that you don't know and if you wanna listen the the list off of shuffle its $11 a month. And the free trial ain't even free. Honestly why I stick with SoundCloud. Sadens me that I hear this app was better till I seen that tho,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very dissapointed, I used to love this app, with ads I used listen to songs with some free features but now there are none for a non premium member.

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Spotify is getting worse after updates .. earlier it was very awesome cause we could play the song from any part we wished to and we can continuously listen to different songs with very less ads .. now it's the worst app for me to listen songs ..it is going to be disliked by everyone very soon.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's okay but I keep getting the same adds or any time I change a playlist I get an add and every 15 minutes I get an ad like even when I put a 'dont recommend this ad' it still gives me it.

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a loyal Spotify user for years, but I'm incredibly disappointed with their recent updates. Removing essential features from the free version and locking them behind a paywall is a major letdown. As someone who appreciated the platform's accessibility, these changes feel like a step backward. Limiting basic functions that were once available to all users diminishes the overall user experience. üòû",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have the ""premium "" version but the latest update stop the music you're listening with every single notification your phone recieves. Before it used to lower the volume so you can hear it but the music kept playing. Now it just sopts, which is incredibly annoying. The community has been posting this in the official spotify forum, but we're being completely ignored by them. Spotify just denies any problem.... is a joke. There are much better options out there now.",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Good during free trial but after that it doesn't allow enough skips then you are stuck listening to songs you don't want to hear. Plus premium is 10$ which is a little bit too much for a music app.,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app for music lovers. It used to be so good but now I can't even change to the next song in my playlist.

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app u gotta pay for every small thing your cannot even skip songs or play your fav part of the song. Instead of spotify I would suggest SOUNDCLOUD app which is free of cost and provide good quality of audio too.,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolute cancer. 4 to 5 ads every 3 or 4 songs. Even if you watch the longer video ad that promises an uninterrupted 30 minutes. Almost unusable. Making me reconsider just carrying physical copies of music I like.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've waited long enough. Lack of high quality streaming is a major issue. Even if introduced signs are that it will come at a price whereas everyone else offers it for free. With Tidal dropping the price of the 24bit / spacial audio hifi plus option to the same as Spotify's paltry 320kb rate is it even a debate now? Also - and I should have looked into this sooner - Spotify's artist payment rate is one of the worst. Tidal pays at least 3x more per stream. Unsubscribed.,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Barely usable at this point. Absolute dumpster fire of a service. Seems like user experience is firmly in the trash as they're compromising core functions of the app in favour of a god damn AI DJ that nobody asked for or uses. Features that put control in the hands of the user have vanished. RIP a genuinely good app just three years ago.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is very entertaining app in the world but there are one problem that is any user was streaming music in one Language that time Spotify song change in every 3 song like English song is changed in Hindi song and mixed song also.,,,

2024/3/20,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Increasingly poor. Offer Audiobooks but at a worse rate than the alternative once you run out of their ridiculously low number of free hours. Have people removing their music frequently due to Spotify being an industry cancer. Push the price up all the time without ever improving the service.

Cannot replay the song. 4. Plenty of ads. 5. Cannot play next song after hitting next song 6 times. It's like they took out the basic fun of listening to songs.

Can't even listen to our fav part again without listening to it from the start. can't even play palylists, queues..can't skip, rewind, repeat, shuffle....it's too bad we can't use the app because of these things. I just hope that spotify fixes it as soon as possible or it's gonna loose its popularity and users all over the world.",,,

Even the basic option of a music player you need to subscribe for premium and have to pay , we were ok with the ads but taking out even a basic option like playing in order and can't even drag the song , once you play you have to listen to the full song you cannot rewind or forward . It's just too much. I have been very loyal to Spotify and infact made my family and many friends to use this app but I'm really disappointed. I guess time to change the app.",,,

Everything was very smooth but now for seeing lyrics, listening to previous song,playing in order,listen to specific parts of the song,etc we have to use premium. even some other songs(which are not in the playlist)are coming. I mean why make playlist then. I would rather download the songs than paying to hear it. It can only be used to listen podcasts which I don't know they'll change",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's absolutely terrible and very disappointing. You need to have premium to be able to listen to your favourite part of the song. The ads were understandable but the new updates are really outraging. It's very annoying and I'm sure Spotify will face a lot of loss because of this. This move was very cheap and needs to be corrected. Everyone I know is switching to other platforms. I wish there was an option of zero stars.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's mediocre, they're constantly adding more and longer ads. To the point where your almost always asked to watch an ad to listen to anything or after every other song. And if you decline it just gets shoved in two songs later. I don't have a problem with most ads but the problem is that they're becoming considerably more frequent, longer and repetitive. I'd rather pass on premium if this is how they treat base level. Even got me to move to Amazon Unlimited once I did want to pay.",,,

Can't even play favorite line from the songs without a premium. And I don't need to talk about the amount of ads. For every song there are 2 ads of 30 seconds each. I've already switched to wynk music app.,,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my favourite music streaming app. Ever since it had updated, it's got ridiculous. As for someone who doesn't know anything about ecommerce, this app has gotten very restrictive for people who don't want to pay for the premium plan. The new update is absolutely rancid, it ceases the purpose of playlist; you can't listen songs in order nor can you listen to songs only in that playlist. Do better.",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been a premium subscriber for years but the most recent update removed the ""like"" button and replaced it with ""add to playlist"". On top of that, they've ignored the customers begging for a true shuffle option, and instead opted for a ""reccomended"" shuffle that adds a bunch of songs I dont like or want. On top of that, it causes insufferable buffering as I do not have great mobile service as those songs aren't downloaded. This has destroyed the way I use the app in every sense.",,,

In a nutshell, pretty disappointing and would not recommend.",,,

I agree with the other reviewers, the old way of adding songs to a playlist wad much easier and the heart for favorites was great for quickly adding to my favorites. (Now it's a tedious task.)

Another thing is the fact that when I click on certain songs, it's only giving pieces of the song, and I really want to listen to these songs.

It changes playlists after being paused for a while. The shuffle feature doesn't really randomize your playlist, but just feeds you the same handful of songs over and over. Sometimes it will play the same song after only a few others, despite the repeat function being off. The price keeps going up, and so do the number of ads. Paying for ads at all is ludicrous.

Give the app the features it has on PC. Better sorting, and group deletions, at a minimum. There's a limit to how many songs you can add to a playlist? Why? What purpose does this serve? Also, stop automatically selecting ""smart recommendations."" No one wants this on their playlist, that's why they made a playlist.",,,

We can't play the previous song and 6 times only we can go forward in the playlist to change the songs. In the recent update, automatically the shuffle option is on and if we don't want to allow it. we need to purchase the subscription.

With its latest update, the company has taken a regrettable turn, significantly compromising the overall user experience.

Every time I come back to the app now I seem to have to force close it to get it to work or else the skip, play/pause and all other buttons become completely unresponsive. Even after re-launching the app you can't then start playing a random song on shuffle, you have to select a particular one first. Very annoying.",,,

Now, when I opened the app again today I couldn't even play anything from my playlist! It just plays audio samples, and random stuff added by AI. I'm not paying money just to listen to music for 30 minutes. Amazing attempt at trashing an app.",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm being just honest..I literally ""hate"" the last update. We should atleast be allowed to choose which song we want to listen from our playlist, that basic feature is moved to premium!And we can't even directly listen to the part of the song that we want, if we look for a specific segment of a song, we have to listen the entire song. We can't even skip them! That's just an ick because music is an essential of most people nowadays, and we should definitely have these rights while listening.",,,

I have about 100 hours of music, the same 20 hours are repeated over and over and some songs are never played. I have to go into the queue and remove 90% of the songs to have a unique experience, which defeats the purpose of asking a smart speaker to shuffle play your playlist. May switch to Amazon music to see if it's any better.",,,
2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been using Spotify for 4 years. There was no ads when it was first launched in india. The ads are understandable but it became worse every year. I used Spotify because it easy to use and the amount of songs I was able to listen to. The new updates are terrible I can't even select the songs I want. No queue. The shuffle is so random. So dissapointed by these updates üòïüòïüòí,,,

Want to like a song? Now you have to manually add it to liked songs , instead of just hitting a heart. Want to add duplicate songs to a Playlist? Too bad, you can't anymore, unless it exists on another album or as a single. Quit ""fixing"" what wasn't broken in the first place.",,,

2024/3/20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,With the newest update the app has gotten much worse taking away features for building playlists. Especially now with limiting the number of times a song can be added to a playlist. With premium once anything has been downloaded the app slows to a crawl and becomes nigh unusable after a while.

You gotta make sure you give 'like/love' to things you like. Or it's not gonna give you what you might enjoy as well. The only real issue I have with it. Premium cost is higher than I'd prefer.

Tried turning it off in settings, but it didn't work. I'm going back to YT Music I think.

Also, ""magic shuffle"" is the worst. We should be able to turn off the option in the settings. Instead, it'll randomly turn on, even when I want to play my playlist without shuffling at all! Please fix it back!",,,

The user experience just got more cumbersome... Now it has a Tiktok/Instagram look and feel, with album covers taking more space than album titles when in should be the other way around.

I mean what's the point of having a music app that doesn't allow you to play the song you want. Think about it, you're feeling a bit free spirited today and don't want to listen to your usual playlist so you go to some random collection and play it and a song that doesn't match your vibe comes up. Now you can't even skip it, ads were one thing but this? This is a plain ""turn off""",,,
