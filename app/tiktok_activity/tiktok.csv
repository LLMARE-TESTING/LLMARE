2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love this app but I one thing I hate is that some features aren't available for everyone. I have tried everything to get photo mode to work and no matter what I do it's not available for me. It's available for friends in my area and every creator I follow. It's really frustrating because I'm a content creator myself and would like the opportunity to utilize these posts! There is no technical support either which is extremely frustrating
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app and all EXCEPT how some different device types have more features. The one thing that I want is to be able to post a photo in a comment. I have a Google pixel and I'm not sure which type of phone (I'm pretty sure it's apple) that can post pictures in the comments but I would like that on every phone type. Overall, its a pretty good app. Would recommend if your fine with a few less features then others"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For 2 months, I have not received notifications from the creators I have selected to get all notifications from. All my settings for notifications are set properly. Nothing has been turned off. I uninstalled and reinstalled with no change to receiving notification. Submitted screen shots to tiktok help, only for them to ask for more screen shots of the same pics I already submitted. Is anyone else having this problem?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had tiktok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal).tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video . I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. The is very annoying, hope they fix the problem soon:)"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love to waste time on this app, but recent updates have made it so hard to navigate on a Galaxy ZFold 4. (tablet mode specifically) I go to check comments and it pulls half the video off screen. When I try to go back to the video, I now can only see half of it. And the comment section disappears completely and I'm left with half a video and a black bar for any other video I try to watch. Please fix ð«"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I usually love the app and love being on it, but in the new update, there's ""transitions"" when you go from screen to screen and when you start recording a video and discard it, the whole damn screen spins for a few seconds. It is the most inconvenient thing and it gives me such a headache. Theres no option to turn it off either. Its keeping me off the app as of right now thats for sure."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an okay app, but I continually have issues with the favorites page. It stops scrolling down after a while, and things often don't favorite to the right folder when I put them there. I've reset my phone and reinstalled the app, and yet it still keeps happening. It's really annoying to have to favorite the video 60 times for it to work because of the feature that notifys the creator when you favorite it. Either than this constant problem, It's a well working app and it's nicely developed."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I hate the fact that you updated the way videos are put into a playlist and the most recent are at the bottom now. Could you change it back to where the most recent are at the top ? Also I don't know if it's just the server but I'm trying to use the search function and it is so glitchy and laggy to the point it flat out just freezes before the video appears playing music where I'm having to exit the whole app because it gets so Frozen and stuck.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly deserves 1 star. I've been dealing with this issue over the past two years and l've reported it previously but you guys never fix this issue for me. I try looking at filters and I try to enjoy the filters that I see in my for you page but it never gives me the option to even see them. My friends and other people are able to see these filters and use them but in my case they don't show up on my end. Please fix this issue for me it's been far too long for this continue happening.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has been having this issue for awhile where it doesn't open and sits on one page for 10 minutes and still does nothing. Or just doesn't open at all. Now after being redownloaded, it's reverted back to before all the updates when it was first released, and once the app is closed, it doesn't load and I have to uninstall and reinstall again only for it to be of unupdated and showing there are none needed. Please fix this."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have an Android phone and the app randomly crashes. This is the 3rd time it's happened. When I open the app and it flashes the black TikTok screen and closes. I tried to clear cache, restart my phone and once I had even waited upto 2 weeks, but nothing worked. It seems like there was an update on 11/03/2024 and today (12/03/2024) my app decides to crash. TikTok need to be more user friendly to Android users (Huawei p30). I've lost so many drafts and memorable videos that I'll never get back."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fine app. I use it a lot. One thing they to change. Please add a scroll feature! So many liked tiktoks I'm never gonna see again because there all the way at the bottom of the liked page. Or if that doesn't work, make it that you can search tiktoks or search a specific date that when you liked it.I don't know if you could make it work but if you can please add it!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never had problems with this app before. Last week it stopped working. I have tried everything. Uninstalling it, restarting my phone, logging in and out, cleared the cache... Nothing works. It's just a black screen when I open it and says I'm not connected to a network even though I have data and wifi and all my other apps work.. I can see a few videos on my for you page but can't login to my account and it won't load more videos.. I'm pretty frustrated."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The TikTok experience has become increasingly frustrating. I deleted and reinstalled the app hoping to fix the editing issue, only to encounter more problems â?no 2x feature, still unable to edit, and reposting is no longer possible. It's disappointing for both viewers and creators. Please address these issues. I can't believe I risked all my drafts for a complete downgrade. ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has many amazing creators but quite the horendous format in which they are displayed. I deleted the app many months ago for the same reason I am writing this review today. TikTok will not let you mute videos unless you pause them. There is a setting that has videos muted upon first opening the app, but you can't play any other audio on your phone. Once you unmute the videos, you can't undo the action. Please add a mute button. It is the bare minimum, and please, let us play our own music."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's definitely been some issues with the app freezing my phone screen. Just did a restart and now I can't see any of my notifications within the app. I tried to report this to the help desk, after I tried all the recommended ways to fix the issue (which didn't work) and all I get is the ""something went wrong try again"". So, I get notifications but can't actually view comments, likes, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's going on but the app is messed up today. It was fine until a few hours ago and now it either won't load a draft, or when I try to post it, it kicks me back to the drafts screen. It's showing me old notifications. I force quit the app, it asked me in app to quit it so I did. I had to log back in, same issue even after restarting my phone. I'm don't want to try uninstalling and reinstalling because I'll lose drafts. Fix plsss"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update feels so unnecessary. The interface feels clunky and whenever I'm trying to repost something it instead shows me a big list of my friends that covers up half of my screen. No one asked for that, the previous interface was great already! Same with the video sliding up when going inti the comments. It's not as annoying but I think most people dislike it based in what I've seen people in the app itself say. Overall, the newest update feels very unnecessary."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now app completely loads different pages wonky, like weird sliding effect. What is that supposed to do, other than be infuriatingly excessive! Still has a lot of flaws. App can be highly unstable at times; freezing, lost connection when there is plenty of service, no Dark Mode for Android when there is supposed to be, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I love TikTok it's a great app but recently there was an update and now the screen spins when I push tabs in the tiktok shop?! Uhm absolutely not the screen shifts when I click into my profile as well as individual chats. Edit: So turns out tiktok added ""transitions"" to the tiktok actions and there is no way to turn it off it's absolutely horrible it hurts my eyes."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has a lot of flaws, so please listen up. Everytime I press the dislike button on a video that I don't like or I'm not interested in, those videos still pop up. And when I press the dislike button on an ad that's useless to me or something I don't like, it doesn't work. And Tiktokers are constantly uploading offensive videos and videos that aren't supposed to be on this app, I report every single time and those videos still show up. I'm not sure if it's a bug or not, but please fix it."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately it's impossible to upload videos. It constantly crashes, freezes, I've lost my drafts and now it literally can't load ANY video I have ""Sorry, something went wrong"" literally all the time. Also the ""not interested"" feature is hidden? And the app keeps on showing me stuff I couldn't care less about or that goes against my beliefs and interests"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been getting so many spammers as well as spyware. That has come from this app. I. Also, I don't understand why this app does not function correctly for me. I have the latest updated version, space, ect, but for whatever reason, it does not post my videos if they're over 3 minutes, and it also does not save to my drafts. So, all the effort I put into editing my videos. TikTok just throws my effort down the drain. If it does not improve these issues I will be deleting my account"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8 months ago my TikTok started loosing major features... the ability to edit.. use filters... use sounds... etc. Several friends have had similar experiences. No matter how many times we have written & requested help from TikTok...none of us have heard back. We have all tried to erase & redownload many times. Some friends have left the app now & I have barely any basic features left. I suspect that TikTok is made for iPhones and anyone with a less common phone gets issue after issue.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know what's going on, but I can not see the comment section. All I get is black screen, and I can only see half videos. Some videos are cut in half (screen not length), and finally I'm seeing the same videos over and over again. This started happening after an update. It worked perfectly before. SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD 4"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is annoying, I'd open the app and they'd just show the black screen, and for the next 5 minutes, it's still loading, I can't use it to do ANYTHING.. It's just taking up space. I updated it, hoping that would change something, it didnt, I'm updating it again. Nothing changes? I'm done I officially hate this app, just used over 100mb updating it for nothing to change... Uninstalled"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is great, but I don't have many updates that other friends have in this app.....I tried everything, and I had an excellent connection, and I tried updating the app but still didn't get the swipe photo thing in the camera, it didn't get the messages update which you can send messages to a friend on tiktok. I want these features in my tiktok account, so I want a solution to my complaint."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Way to many ads and can you for the love of god add a mute button. Update: thank you for allowing the app to be opened muted but i would still like to see a mute button. Also please send ""live"" video feeds to their own tab. I hate having ""live"" feeds pop up on my FYP. Now i see more ads then before. Please make it so you can opt put from ads."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app honestly, it's really fun to watch and make videos. I do have an issue though - in videos where there's CLEARLY an effect being used it doesn't display the little button that has the effect name on it if yk what I mean, then when I try to search for the effect it isn't there. if this is because of the device I have then it's stupid as hell because I have a brand new samsung phone. please fix this issue and also make dark mode available to samsung users ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Created an account a few days ago, and haven't been able to use the app whatsoever. App crashes constantly, freezes when trying to scroll. I cannot follow, like, or comment on videos at all. Every account I follow immediately unfollows after refreshing the page, and all my likes immediately unlike once I scroll. What's the point of joining if you won't let me use the app whatsoever?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I close the app to do other things the app will pop up and reopen itself randomly. Getting spammed with fake ""you are selected as winner"" accounts. At first all my reports came back as not against their tos but now they're just ignored. Also they direct you towards an unhelpful FAQ and at the bottom it says ""is your problem resolved"" and the no button literally doesn't work. It's not a button. Only yes is a button."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are so many flaws to this app's system and formatting. The only thing that makes it good is the community of people creating content. To name a few issues that I notice the most: the search engine is inaccurate, I can never find videos again unless I like them, the unwatched button doesn't work, and the app reposts videos randomly on my account."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Useless after the update. I cannot log in via username. You put in the password, complete the authentication, and then it just makes you put the password in again. Top of that, my videos are disappearing? I post them and they're completely gone within less than 10 seconds. They're not getting flagged for community violations to my knowledge, they're just getting pulled. I even tried reposting a video that is currently on my page, and the same thing happens. Bricked."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST UPDATE! Used to love the app until The new update made the transition screen spin... genuinely considering closing my account because of it. And having photosensitivity turned on does NOT change it. They give the option to avoid videos with flashing lights but put it a potential trigger that can't be removed. I would give no stars if I could. Very disappointed
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was working fine until the recent update. I've been having problems with commenting. When I try to post a comment it will randomly only post part of the comment, or if you hit the wrong person to reply to, your comment bar freezes up at the bottom of the screen and won't let you close it. Have to close and restart the app, and even after doing that, it still does it every time I want to comment on something."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IDENTITY FRAUD!!!! This app has poor features your identity can be duplicated or stolen. App has several defects. Causing delays, but it's OK for connecting with people. My issue now is the latest update has huge delays I can't login"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use this app often and there's these weird animations when you click on notifications/dms/etc. One is like a very quick PowerPoint transition like one tab flipping in front of another, and another is a pulsating animation that lasts about 3 or 4 seconds. It's very distracting and makes me motion sick, idk if this is a new update or something but I can't find a way to turn it off in settings+I'm considering uninstalling because of this."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App will not open. There is no cache saved to clear. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, restarted my phone etc. The app will not open. It just freezes at the title screen. Opening it from Google play store will not work. My phone does not need an update. Please fix this app. Platform: Android/Huawei p30. Edit: March 2024, problem has not been fixed. Tik Tok, have you got anything to say?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's like every time there's a new update they add something random for the commercials. Such as of course phone promos and now it's to download movie or series app. The worst part about these movie apps they are very disturbing. Having to do with SA or SEXUAL CONTACT. THAT'S ONE WAY TO KEEP ME OFF OF THIS APP. I wish there was a way to turn off commercials but unfortunately there isn't. Tiktok has been able to make me feel uncomfortable ONCE AGAIN. Thumbs down if I could write a zero I would.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Seriously fix your app I have non stop issues between my whole screen doing cartwheels and flips, I'm not even kidding or exaggerating I wish I was, to my cover photo/clip never uploading and saving, every video I have posted in the last two months won't post with my chosen and saved cover, the app changes it to the default cover. Either make it fixable and possibly to change after it's been uploaded or fix your app. It makes my page look terrible and makes me not want to post on your app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So I watched a video on my feed on someone's page you end it with an ad and then you play an ad the next video and then three videos later there's another ad and then there's another ad and then you play another video on an ad what the hell! I can never report a problem to your company it's always Network issues, try again later. Why can I no longer set my videos to be viewed a certain way instead of having to do it for every single video?"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"keeps logging me out of every single account i make. update: tiktok has been playing up this morning, it has not been letting me in the app itself and when i go into my recent apps it is not even there. PLEASE FIX!!! edit- this stuff still happens! but now it's also crashing when i open the app! fix!! edit- i uninstalled it and got it back, now it's saying all my reposts are gone (i had probably ovee 300) and my repost button is also gone??!"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would given it more but with the live stream feature is a bit questionable as it started kicking me off due to inactivity even though there's always something happening. Something needs to be fix quick as this is beyond annoying me and creators alike. Sort it out!
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good and accessible app I love the features and it's pretty easy to edit with ..the only problem am having is that after updating the app I can't follow other tiktokers of I follow them it doesn't reflect on my following list and it won't reflect on their page that I have followed them I hope tiktok fix this soon enough Thanks
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I like watching tiktok and the videos are so cool, but there are tons of complaints. First of all I can't fund my REPOST BUTTON. This is very annoying ð also I can't even send messages on tiktok even though u did nothing, I can't even find the msg button also. Plz I'm to check this out... I'm very upset at this point.. like what's the use of using tiktok ð. One more thing I don't have the button to like... select emojis... there are only 5 emojis I'm using.. tysm"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,May we please have a feature that allows us to block content by sound. PLEASE! And I mean block sound not report sound. I may not like the sound but there are those who like it. I just want it to stop appearing on my wall only. Not to remove the sound entirely.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a samsung galaxy a15 and my phone has a dark mode, I thought I could use that to get dark mode, I cannot, and the ""display "" option isn't there in my settings on the app. The brightness of this app has literally caused it to BURN into people's screens, and I do not want that. Also, I have extremely sensitive eyes and being blinded anytime I open the app is not fun in any way. PLEASE fix this in the next update, it's literally damaging to the eyes. Also, stop unliking videos FOR me."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Galaxy Fold problem me and my husband have a galaxy. Fold4, and both of them are having problems with TikTok. The screen will load half of the screen and the other side be black. Also, the comments are always off , With this new update, please fix this now. I know our phones are new so it has nothing to do it ."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since I've gotten a new phone the favorites button is gone. I've tried trouble shooting all the tips from googling this issue. Nothing has fixed it. It's astonishing that this garbage app has had this issue for years and they haven't fixed it still.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be great until TikTok shop took it over. You won't make it passed two tiktoks before seeing another one. They have an option to search solely tiktok shop but still insist on having it 90% of everyone for you page as well ...
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok. I have an issue though where it says that you can edit the caption and then the next day it says you can't edit it and I don't know why. Can you help me fix it pretty please? I also would love it if you add a feature to where you can change your pictures, videos and the songs after it's posted."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is going from bad to worse with every update. Don't see the translate feature under videos anymore, don't receive notifications for comments and replies(even with the notifications settings turned on), and a new update with video links; they have added this ""Your friend shared this video with you. Watch it now!"" text before the actual link. What is wrong with ya guys? don't like things just working fine that you have to mess'em up with unnecessary useless updates? Fix these issues"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tictok refuses to do anything about the buttons on the bottom being constantly visible causing burn-in. This happened to my last phone. Last night i found out they also have pages, like showing videos out of messaging, that prevent your phone from timing out the screen. So this is the second phone ive gotten burn in from just using this app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since loading it, it will not let me follow anyone and even when you click on follow friends, it never shows up that you are. The follow button disappears but as soon as you go to friends it's empty. No matter how many times you try to follow or add them they never show up in your friends list. Even when you get a follow message and click follow back, they never show up. So what's the point."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""nudge"" thing was a dumb addition. Ads on the following page are awful. Video and audio unsync, this has been happening a lot on live streams. Can't block sounds when they get annoying and they keep showing up after hitting ""not interested"" every time. Insane amount of bots and scam accounts, this is a serious issue. So many fake accounts of bots stealing content, when one gets taken down then 5 more pop up"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi there ticktock, I must say this is a good app, but on the honor phones, basically I opened ticktock, and I couldn't faviroute any videos so I went to the play store and updated it, I went to open it again, and it would show me the loading screen then kick me out. Just un-installed and re-installed it, I can now get in, but I still can't faviroute videos! I've checked Google play for any updates, but my app is all up to date, please fix this!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Direct massaging is not available for no reason since 3 weeks. Tiktok is not helping to resolve the issue neither answering my reports all ik getting is generated answers that say ""thank you for loving tiktok"" which is completely irrelevant and so disrespectful considering my long explanations of the problem with provided screenshots. Very bad service for such an big application. I cant have the full experience and many people have the same issue. Instagram better."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Useless only for dummies. NO black screen! Invisible small buttons, complex and small fonts I upload my own videos with my copyright but even recording a video is useless. Then, you put your own voice and songs with YOUR voice recorded with YouTube account and they banned it ALWAYS. As an artist, I have to say, I found it frustrating. *Update 2024: I finally left the app last year! Btw it needs bigger and better fonts. Not improving."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I updated the app and it logged me out. I can't even log back in, it keeps giving me an error ""try a different method or try again later"". I can't even make it to the password screen unless I use my username, but even trying to reset my password, I get the same error. I've tried in app help and it didn't help at all. Fix your app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extra movement with the new update when swapping from videos to settings or friends DMs is absolutely irritating to look at. It's unnecessary to have extreme movement when opening someone's DM, or opening an video from the DM, or closing out of settings/DMs. Remove this feature or at least make it an option to disable this extra movement in accessibility."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Still an issue. Hey, R&D, quit screwing with the algorithm. You keep taking me off pages I've been following for months! what's the deal? Finally caved I love technology. I really resisted loading TT , cuz of the challenges, which I think are mostly stupid. But there is a lot of really good content. DIY galore! Pleasantly surprised. Thanks to the developers and content providers! Pls try to keep the ads down. That has ruined FB, IG, and Snap. Pretty please..."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"my fav feature is pretty much useless now. I don't know what happened, but now after maybe 8 related videos on search, there is a random feed having nothing to do with the search. There will be more videos related to you search, but you won't see them while you're scrolling on it and it is very frustrating if you're trying to see very specific content or learn more about something. Almost makes me want to delete the app tbh"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason the filter I use on tiktok, the most basic one: Green Screen isn't appearing on my new galaxy flip. Along with a bunch of other ones. It's so barren that the trending page only has one supposed filter! I've been seeing reviews here that the tiktok support team said some filters are not available on all phones... What? It's amazing how that makes no sense to start with but the basic green screen isn't available on a galaxy flip but is working on my pixel?! Stupid!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"apps worked fine for a while. however, no matter how much you can complain about a feature, it doesn't seem to matter. removing the comment feature on reposts, not having dark mode available for android, moving the repost button 50 times, and now the copyright update. this app is BASED on music. cosplayers, dancers, singers, editors, they are holding tiktok up singlehandedly. trends happen via MUSIC. taking away the entire purpose of this app is useless. DISAPPOINTING. make your app WORK."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"That's great to hear! TikTok's ""Use this/any template"" feature indeed offers a convenient way to create diverse and engaging content. It's fantastic that you enjoy exploring various categories like art, videography, photography, and sharing your voice poetry. Keep having fun and expressing yourself on the platform!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I love all the relatable funny , and useful content on here,but sametimes there are problems that occur that are really not supposed too, I don't know if anyone else has been having the same problem as me, but my recently every time I like a video from my fyp, it doesn't appear on my profile in the liked videos section'l tried refreshing multiplayer times,l don't have to update the app because it doesn't need to, and I have cleared out any other tubs that may be open on my phone"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be good but half my features have been removed. Can't record for more than 60 seconds, text to speech has disappeared. Barely any filters. It's all gone."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app rolls out some cool new features at the pace of a frozen snail. I've seen some users with dark mode for over a year hoping that with the next update I'll be able to read comment sections without issues and still no dark mode. 1/13 Every new update comes with bad PowerPoint transitions that nobody asked for or wants that you have to submit help tickets to get removed.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was excellent until some software issue prevented me from recording videos. The screen goes black and none of the time increments work. I've updated, changed my phone settings, and restarted my phone. None of it worked. The ads the instant I open the app are annoying too because they lag when closing."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't have the repost option and when I go to settings then privacy there is no repost option and when I delete the app and reinstall it the repost button appears for maybe 30 min then it disappears so if u can help me fix this it would be a perfect app bcs every thing is already perfect ð¥°
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It will attempt to get you to befriend your contacts, even after explicitly not giving permission to connect them. Wayyy too many bots who can just add absolutely everyone to their friend list and I have to spend time out of my day removing or blocking them. You can use the ""filter keywords"" feature but it will still show you videos with those keywords so why even try"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever updates are being done has messed up the commenting features during like. I also noticed the COPYRIGHT thing on your videos. If we have to change the music, why can't we get rid of the wording on the video? The words of the SONGS no longer match up with the words on showing on your videos. There's no option to erase them."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app and fun as well, I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have any problems following others because every time time I would follow someone and either refresh the screen or leave and re-enter their page my following would disappear, and I don't if anyone is having this problem or if it's just me but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated about it"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update that came out yesterday is full of bugs!!! I can't even comment on a video without it freezing up, then I have to close out and try again. After about 4 times, I can finally post a comment. Also when toggling between pages, it's glitching. FIX IT!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of the most annoying and useless that I have downloaded in my history of using smart phones. You get a daily assault of, what seem to be bots, asking to follow or friend. The app even has a built-in feature to corral these requests to a special area in the app to deal with later. If you do comply to the request and there is a person chatting with you, they seem to not know that you can create a profile to list your basic information. It just becomes tedious to continue to answer."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall one of the best apps I've ever used, but I do not get slideshows on my FYP or following and I've tried everything but it does not work. Aswell I cannot use the repost button and it only works if I uninstall and them reinstall the app, and only works the first time I open it. I've had this app since 2019 and it has always been like this. Fix it please."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to use the app all the time, now with the new update I cannot switch between screens because the animation, which I cannot turn off, gives me migraines and makes me nauseous. I cannot view videos friends have sent me, look at my notifications, or view video comments without triggering this animation. I will be rarely using this app now, if at all."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is great, but I experience that same bug over and over, my following page don't show up, I only have for you page, when I change account it's fix but it comes back after I close tik tok app."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I worked so hard to edit a video, and I tried to post it, and it isn't eligible for the for you page, probably because it's a little hard to see. I feel like that guideline is too harsh and very unfair, as I would see other videos way much blurry on my feed. It isn't fair for content creators because it's not our problem that a clip comes out blurry on your app... my clips were not blurry until I posted the tiktok."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, although it's weird how some features aren't accessible. I've compared two of the same phones, one can post slideshows and the other can't. Would be cool if all the features were accessible on all devices. Great app overall! Gets the job done."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok has removed a lot of their translate features, I used to be able to see videos in other languages, and tiktok would have the auto translate features in their closed captions.. I really wish they would bring that back. Don't understand why they would get rid of it. Better experience recommendation is to offer the user to see what language videos they want to see (checkbox all that apply) and then develop translate features."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If I'm honest the app is amazing in all but there is some problems, like reposts. Everyone I know can do reposts but I've been able to only do it one time and I've never seen that button to repost ever again, as well as the whole ""your tapping too fast take a break"" even if it's just after liking almost 20 videos I've had to make a favourite collection just to go back to the videos I couldn't like the other day. Please get rid of that and fix reposts."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is great though i have faced only one problem. There is no possible way of changing the download location apart from sd card and phone storage. Am kindly asking developers to add this feature to enable users change download location to different folders and also a feedback
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"ðthe best feature i like most in tiktok is use this any template and i can easily edit videos with just 1 one click and it s a great way to spend my free time ,it includes all kinds of good content including poetry and islamic video's template . videography.photography.etc.where i can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of i also speak my voice poetry . thank you all tiktok family and please follow and full support me thanks ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app does what it's supposed to do mostly. It shows your video for how long they are and you can scroll on. But the like feature for me is gliched. Ever since I deleted my old account my new one has been unable to like certain videos. I've sent many requests for them to not answer what's so ever making the support team practically useless. Tiktok please fix this.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but theres some problems -many unnesesary updates- they often ruin the experience when nobody asked for them -the deleting account procces. I think you should be given the option wether you actually want to wait the 30. Also the fact that if you havent waited the 30 days and want to use the same gmail account it automatically renews it -The ""not interested"" button not working especially with live videos -adds, even if youre looking at someones account -optimalised only for iphone"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's been like 3 years why is there no dark mode like it doesn't take 3 years to add a feature like dark mode. *Update* It's been maybe 5 years now, still no dark mode, EVEN SNAPCHAT FINALLY ADDED DARK MODE!! TikTok is unstable as hell, takes up a lot of storage even without any drafts, after deleting cache and history. AND ALSO REMOVING REPOST COMMENTS WAS SUCH AN UNNECESSARY THING TO DO, LIKE THAT WAS SO UNCALLED FOR, WHO ASKED FOR THAT???"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App used to be fine, workable, etc. Recent update added a transition visual effect to opening comments/posting videos that causes flashing and spinning on the screen triggering photosensitivity. Nausea inducing to try to use, please fix or give us the accessibility setting to turn it off at least."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This may be the legit buggiest piece of software I've ever touched and I'm a software engineer so that includes half written apps. How is this a major platform? I can't even follow accounts. Help page says to clear cache. Doesn't help. Same thing happens on two different phones. What's the point of a social media platform if the most basic function of it is broken? Go back to undergrad.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all, but I've been having a current problem where I click the follow button to follow another user, but it doesn't work. It keeps telling me to follow them as if I hadn't already clicked the button to. I've tried everything, including creating another account to follow the people I want, but it still doesn't work. Please can something be done about this!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is cool. But I just don't believe only 20 of my 4000+ followers make videos each day. And requesting samples aren't easy, why when I tap the buttons to request samples or closes instead of open when I never tapped anything to close it. It should be much easier to put in a request"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I was watching my videos, all of a sudden my for you page turned into something called ""restricted mode"", I don't know why they did this, but Tik Tok please fix this. It is incredibly annoying, because I can't look at my following, lives, the Tik Tok shop, or search anything. And everytime I try to log in to a different account, it asked me for a passcode that they never told me about because of the restricted mode. Tik Tok please fix this it is incredibly annoying."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love this app and use it. It's a big inconvenience. They remove features for private messages you send. I was talking to my friend, and said ""inner 9 year old me is coming out"", talking about how when I was 9, I was obsessed with the topic. Not even 30 seconds after, they remove my DMs, and tried to put a screen time on my account. I am NOT 9!!! I am 16!! And they won't appeal my account, I tried submitting a photo with my date of birth on a paper with my mother and nothing."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using the app compared amongst all others. I mean, that's my own preference. I will not know other people's preferences. But to me, above all social platforms, it is most happy and socializing and also has Manny features that suit my interests. Therefore, I recommend every individual without forcing, but as personal choice, yu yet yu traim."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the experience, but absolutely no optimization for the Fold 5. I've reinstalled, etc. A few updates ago, they broke how videos are viewed when unfolded, half the time the comments open randomly, and push the video off the screen. I've waited for a fix to no avail."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, been a daily user since 2020. However I'm incredibly frustrated that the new update has taken away the ""following"" tab. I no longer follow people or they dissapear from my FYP. There is the friends tab but unless they follow you back (which a lot of big creators don't) they don't come on your FYP very often. PLEASE BRING IT BACK"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"create a feature where you can search through your liked or favorite videos using keywords. rather than having to scroll endlessly through your liked or favorite videos just to find one video. many times people overlook and pass the one video they're trying to find in the long list of liked or favorite videos. sometimes people never find the video because come to find out they never ""liked"" the video to begin with and thought they hit like."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I had this app for about 3-4 years now and don't get me wrong it's great and entertaining especially cause you get to choose what you want to watch and have lots of options for videos your for you page your profile etc... but i still don't have slideshows???!! Like i always want to use them plus anyone who uses them is always viral like it's not fair i just get effects like? Anyway please give me SLIDESHOWS!!ðð» Overal i rate this app 3.5/5 stars thanks for reading!
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I hate that they try new arrangements in the buttons, me as autistic i like how is always or if it easier. The new update for sharing is horrible, the friends icon its too big unnecessary. And for sharing to other apps i need everytime choose other because it will only save 2 app on the fast share."

Thank you ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is a good application and liked by most young people but in my opinion there are some actions that tiktok should do for example when I open the camera to make a video I often (not always) find myself in difficult situations because the camera works too slowly but there are times when is screen freeze. A good side of downloading videos or photos is that they are downloaded very quickly in less than 2 minutes. I need an update from tiktok so this app will work better.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"ðThe best feature I like most in Tiktok is ""use this/any Template"",s I can edit videos easily with just 1 click s a best way to pass my free time it includes all kinds of good content including art videos,templates,videography, photography, etc where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of I also speak my voice poetry.Thank you:)"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"every week they change the apps layout I had slideshows like a week ago and now I can't find any? the repost button keeps moving around +you can't add a comment to your repost anymore? tiktok shop recommends me products I have no interest in? you wanna change your app around, maybe fix it, make it so that it's easy to navigate again, make it so that videos don't randomly un-post themselves"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My videos keep getting muted for having copyrighted music despite it being my music...I'm also unable to convert my page into an artist account even though the creative hub makes it seem easy to do. I'm already confirmed as a tiktok artist but still find my videos muted for using music the app recognises as my own. I'm also unable to use my music as a sound so I can't even tell followers to use the sounds. I've tried numerous times bit still nothing, i need help"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1/23/24 I loved this app for info and entertainment but it just started crashing like. Everytime I try to pause a video it sends me to a livestream, and the buttons are out of wack. And also the censorship is getting a little insane. But other than that, I enjoy it mostly."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow I knew this app was was trash going in but I was not prepared for how bad it would actually be. The auto music on the effects was about to give me an aneurysm and the whole reason I downloaded it was to use the avatar generator feature, but it crashes the app every time I try to open the effect meaning the whole thing is pretty much useless to me. I can see how using this app consistently would kill brain cells and make you stupid. Save yourself the stress and just use YouTube shorts. 0/5"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Changes its features wayyyy too much... Anytime you get used to something or start liking something, it's gone or changed in the next two days. This app needs to learn consistency. The shop is a total scam and almost every item on there has weird prices and questionable reviews that look oddly similar to bots."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dang Like when will they stop messing with stuff that there's nothing wrong with now they add a feature where when you fast forward or when you've watched so much of a video and you try to go back to the video it just picks up where it's left off instead of starting the video over like bro who asked for that That's so annoying I scroll past and scroll back up sometimes to restart the video but now it doesn't do that anymore Like bro I can never win with this app It's so annoying
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Firstly, when you search for something as you looking at the first related videos it only scroll of that one slot so you have to manually scroll over and over until your at the first video and not just the top of the page. Secondly, the more you scroll in a search, the more COMPLETELY unrelated topics get. Like, yes, I want food recipes, but NO, I don't want to see someone's BEAR FEET. I know for a fact that this isn't due to my algorithm, so please get this issue fixed."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the app. I upload videos and get over million views but the only thing that bothers me is the interface I really dislike the fact that there is a massive white plus on the bottom whilst watching videos. If only the developers could be able to make the buttons hide so the content could become full screen.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ads are out of control. The updates are horrible and rarely get revoked, even though I have seen hundreds of videos complaining. Repost Comments needs to be a thing, as well as fixing the comments back to over the videos. The TikTok shop is a total dcam, and I keep getting videos about products I just would never use. Not to mention, the algorithm sucks and does not work. I click the not interested button and get more videos than before correlated to the video. Litsen to your users."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One of the more recent updates has caused videos on the FYP to be cropped. I can see on the pages there is more to the video but when playing the videos it just cuts it off. -videos of topics still show up on FYP despite blocking pages click ""Not interested"" -iOS has a dark mode version, but Android does not. -TikTok flagrantly violates Androids privacy policies pulling information about your contacts despite disabling it both in Android and in App."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The following page keeps disappearing, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times but the following page keeps disappearing after a while of reinstalling the app. Please find a way to fix this bug cause I can't keep up with the stress of always uninstalling the app just to reinstall it back."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is soo good, bar the glicthes like not being able to make a slide show no matter how many times i try to fix this. As there is no button to say if you want a slide show or video. Im hoping tiktok will fixs this as i know alot of ppl have the same issue."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the update now when you scroll you can hear the video but the screen is black. My other issue is the ads after the video, why just why. You had to go and ruin it. We already get ads at the beginning why put them with the videos too. Just like YouTube and that's why I don't go to YouTube too much now, ads."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too much junk and ads on fyp. Even on following page, still a lot of junk from ppl I don't even follow. Really annoying. Algorithm doesn't work very well when blocking irrelevant accounts, they still show up. No ad has matched my interests. All I see is TikTok shop ads as well. Also, ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE: you cannot report an account for stealing/pretending to be another user's account/persona."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For God's sake, it's like you developers have bone to pick with Android users. Every feature added has usually been added to Ios first then I on my Samsung phone need to wait a lifetime for it to be on mine, not to mention dark mode. I can't open the damn app without getting flash banged, and I have friends who have had it for who knows how long. How long does it take to invert the color from white to black?"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Look i enjoy the app as much as anyone else but you can't tell it your screens aspect ratio, so people like me with tall thin phones get the sides of videos cut off with no way to fix - this has since been fixed, yay. Why are comment threads not a timeline? It's so difficult to read a discussion - menu transitions try and do like 3 different animations at once and it looks awful"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing in ways like all things but allowing all these fake pages and allowing people to fake issues with creators page and now the app won't let me block bots, it's not showing my messages, its spinning when tryong to send in issues and wont load. I have emailed and sent in issues with my app and nothing as of yet."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was good before the recent updates, now its very buggy when i try to search for anything, the page will slide to the left before glitching out, shrinking in on the screen, and finally pulling me up to the search page. This happens when i want to pull up anything that isnt on my fyp"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wanted to look through someone's reposts but when I check it didn't show the repost icon ð­ð­ Everytime I uninstall and reinstall it'll show up but when I reopen the app it just stops showing it.. I'm on my 6th reinstall rn. Tiktok would usually take away features I would usually have for some odd reason and it's hella dumb
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok previously had closed captions as an option, but they've completely disappeared for me (no longer present in the menu and no longer present in videos). I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times to no change."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's OK some vids are fun others informative others HATEFULL. The problem that irks me is if I interact in any shape or form ( comment, like ) then I'm inundated with all their content! I thought that was what the follow button was for! I want to have some control over what content that is selected for me. Thanx!"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is not so bad when you know who to follow and who not to, you'll get a really cool fyp. But the commenting your reposts and liking other people's reposts feature being gone has got on my nerves, it was basically the best feature of the app and it's gone now. I really want it to come back because it makes all the app more fun to interact with, without it it's pretty dry."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. I've had it for a few years and it's a great way of seeing and posting relatable content and connecting with like-minded people. It's a fun app and a fun community, but what is going on with the muting of multiple tiktoks on many accounts, including both of mine?? I know other people have experienced this too over the past couple of days and that it's not just me. It really sucks, especially for people who spend so much time making edits, like me. Do better and sort it out!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update I cant see live previews at the top of the screen in my inbox, or following page. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've cleared the cache and downloads. Restarted my phone. Nothing worked."

If you want to stay on a place permanently don't go on this app. If you get kicked out you get an option that says username and password but if you forget it it doesn't even let you clicked the button called ' log in with no password'
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's happening to TikTok?? So first, Tiktok took away my photo and video button and I couldn't upload photos.

But then I found a very funny and relatable video, which I wanted to repost, so like normal, im about to click the repost button yet it didn't let me. In fact, on every single video, the repost button was GONE! Thus, I am thoroughly outraged. If tiktok doesn't add this back,I will be writing more bad reviews about it. For this,I think they deserve a 1 star. You were good. But you downgraded completely. I'm disappointed.. :/"

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app can be fun, but it seems they update things and when they do features just disappear. Most days I post jokes with effects, but today, the effects were just gone. I mostly enjoy the app, but the random removal of stuff without notice is obnoxious."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is basically non functional. It doesn't allow me to actually follow content that I like, leaving me at the whim of the For You page to provide content I'm not interest in. Help content doesn't work, and there's no request additional help functionality. I'm sure this isn't everyone's experience, but my experience is terrible."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy being on this app but I'm not very happy at all right now. Yesterday everything was fine and today after I got home and tried to get on here I have to log back in and now all of a sudden my entire profile was empty, wiped clean like I never did anything on it. I have had this app a long time and no issues now all of a sudden my entire profile is gone along with my following and my for you page filled with videos i have no interest in part of the time."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No comment section, half the video is cut off. Ever since the last update I can't read comment sections its just half a black blank screen.

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the recent update my app is all weird. Half the time the comments won't show, sometimes the video is halfway off the screen, it's so strange. I even deleted and re-download the app, but its still doing the same thing."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Im addicted to this app, the vids are good but the way the moderation system goes you could post absolutely nothing and get banned for nudity and yet a minor dancing around in a bikini doesn't get taken down? Plus they keep adding and then removing features that worked rly well."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What I want is for you to be able to unsend messages and to send pictures and videos from your phone gallery so that way it can be easier to text and communicate. I've been wanting this feature for a while, and I hope you guys add this pretty soon."

Is this a new update ???"

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate tiktoks new updates. It removed the comment repost, pin comment, captions, retouch filter, and it just took away every beauty filter. I literally do not have any filter that is beauty related. Only games, greenscreen, etc. Now I'm just insecure in my tiktoks because there is absolutely no filters. Fix it please."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good, but I have some issues. Whenever I update the app, I will get a feature I've never had 6 when I update it again, it's gone. My ability to repost videos will change every time I update, and I can't view friends' reposts."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No music? No good reviewð¤·ââï¸? Ur problem. And now, when I go to check my inbox, it does this weird thing where it flips the page and makes it look like it's not working or it's lagging. Please fix it. It's annoying."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They're working very hard to suppress people's content. They're working even harder to manipulate people into buying their promote package by preventing people's videos from being seen. The promote package they want you to buy has extremely low value. I've posted quite a few videos, and you can tell when they take it off the ""for you"" page because my videos get good engagement for a few minutes, then nothing. On top of that, the regularly shadow ban people for apparently nothing."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Disgusting app! Doesn't matter what page you Blick it still ends up on my fyp!!!!!! The ""not interested"" has not worked in over 2 years! And I'm constantly having to figure out why I'm seeing the exact same video even if I refresh my feed"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's not the best because I used to have the ""slideshow"" feature and now I don't and there's some inappropriate pictures on certain people's thumbnails (which I'm not gonna say the name of em) and people really don't want to see that stuff and I needs taken down cause people think it's not fair if their videos get taken down and the people's don't."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Glitching like crazy. My FYP keeps reloading things I have already seen and I keep getting pushed content that I'm not interested in. Lives and loading videos are extremely choppy, but my internet is not the problem. The new repost feature sucks as well."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been a user for 4 years. It's a shame that the updates don't improve the app. First they deleted the option to pin comments, then they changed the fonts, and the repost button. No one had a problem with those things, why change it? The most annoying thing though, is the report system. Tiktok takes down videos and comments that don't deserve it, yet they can't find violations in the videos I report, which clearly go against the violations. Please fix this, to keep your app and its users safe."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This latest update messed up the videos. Half of them are scrunched to one side and you can't see part of it. The other ones don't show any options on the screen sometimes.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Many options are not available in TikTok. Previously it was very best but nowadays it is going bad. A lot of functions are missing from TikTok. I request to the owner of the software please update it bring new features in it which make it better. From it many functions and effects have been missing. I am running this app from August 2023 because it attracted me with it beautiful effects now it is looking awkward. Please please make it more and more best and bring newness in the software all enjo

2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok used to be so good and fun to use but now since TikTok has taken away the slideshow feature for most of us and the app has gotten more bugs now, it gotten annoying, also not to mention they have taken away some of the most famous audios because they just refuse to pay universal music studio, TikTok please fix your app"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love the app! I'm looking forward to creating more on there! I don't like that the app can get slow when editing or posting a video. For instance today I picked out the cover of my video and it totally didn't set. Now my video has a weird cover. It's happened to me multiple times. I think there should be an edit feature for that specific default. Even for editing the caption! There could be a lot of great fixes! Please listen to your users! ð¤ð«¶
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I love all the relatable, funny, and useful content on here, but sometimes there are problems that occur that are really not supposed too. I don't know if anyone else has been having the same problem as me, but my recently every time I like a video from my fyp, it doesn't appear on my profile in the liked videos section. I tried refreshing multiple times, I don't have to update the app because it doesn't need to, and I have cleared out any other tabs that may be open on my phone."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, I love being able to save TikTok's and watch them offline or send to a friend. But here's my problem, I heard of Message DM on TT but I have no way at all of using it! Plus I can't do the slideshow as in sliding the images, but my friends can do these things and I can't, I'm frustrated with it and don't understand one fricken bit why I can't use these features..."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"We like the concept and using this app. Just the glitches along with finding that for our Galaxy S9 it has lesser features than our Galaxy S7 did. Effects are much lesser, which could do with a search option along with many other features, such as when editing a video sharing we have to search through all of the editing effects only to find they move around based off of how much we use them until a new one comes in and shakes it all up, we need a search option along with an *Add to favourites*"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i have used this app regularly for over a year. i really enjoyed until the most recent update. now, between tabs, it does this awful ppt transition on the screen. like it spins the entire screen a couple times and then goes back to where you wanted to go. it's not only deeply annoying because the transition is too long and too overt, it causes a headache. i like tiktok and the info i get from the creators i follow, but this update is the most bizarre and unnecessary app change ive ever seen."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The for you page isn't for you anymore, every third video is an ad and it repeatedly shows posts I've deliberately clicked ""not interested"" on. At least vine went out with a bang"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TikTok removed the add comments to repost. That was one of the best features in my opinion & taken all of the music that we actually like away. I had A few sounds saved as favorite & now they're completely gone.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally just went on the app store after having this app for a long time to actually rate it. Why is it 5 stars? They constantly do updates and listen to us as viewers. They added a function where you can add the music you hear from the tiktoks. No more searching the song or asking in the comments. Love this app
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I absolutely cannot stand the amount of bots all over. The fact that reporting these pages does nothing at all while they continually post inappropriate stuff and fake engagement with some amazing content creators. This is honestly ridiculous. And you can easily tell they are fake pages but somehow you guys can't figure that out?!
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Become boring, keeps adding too much, like the tiktok store. If you could make it so my feed is more like it was a few years ago instead of having three or four different pages to scroll."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad. They added a new feature of downloading offline videos, but if I am offline and turn the wifi on, the ""offline"" videos will instantly not work anymore and are going to be wifi needed to watch"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent. But please update a version to attach screenshots, pictures, and videos in the comments, will make it an excellent interactive experience"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"2 year update. Would be nice if there was an auto scroll or something. I had already bought a little ring to click so I don't have to touch my phone..... Secondly, can we opt out of all the damned TT shop videos?!?? And that thing on the screen that says to add whatever?!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A good app to pass time but after a few tiktoks the next ones start to lag. I have good internet and yet this still happens to me all the time. It's been happening for ages now too and I like how TikTok refuses to fix it. Then we have the 'just watched' button. It's useless, it takes forever to get to the video, even if it's just one little scroll away. Please fix these problems"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tried to sign up as a seller hit back button during the process and now can't log into.my tic tok. There is no way to contact anyone for support. Absolutely frustrating
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Get ride if the auto refresh. It's crazy annoying when you accidentally hit your page and go back and it refreshes. It should stay on the video you were watching. It's turning into all advertisements......
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure what happened in the latest update, but my following tab has completely disappeared. I tried uninstall ING and re-install, which worked for a night. The next day the following tab was gone again. Please fix."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps changing interfaces and my ""friends"" tab keeps getting replaced by a ""discover"" tab that prevents my ""for you"" videos from even loading. I can uninstall/reinstall the app and it acts normal for a short time before the app goes right back to malfunctioning/freezing and the ""friends"" tab is gone again. I really love Tiktok and want to keep using it but it seems to only be geared towards Tiktok shop now, rather than connecting with the friends I've made. It's incredibly frustrating."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Why take away the search feature for followers/following lists? This is a really useful and important feature. Taking away functionality/features is never a good thing. This makes the app way more difficult to navigate and therefore less enjoyable. Also, those lists should be able to be sorted numerically and alphabetically. Lastly why is there no dark mode. Make the app better not worse. *Edit: search bar is back"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I rarely have any complaints about this app but my number 1 problem is this: there should be a way to sort favorited audios into playlists like videos. As someone who makes videos, I have collected thousands of sounds to use but most are almost completely unaccessible due to the amount of scrolling that would need to be done. If a feature to sort them was added, I would definitely give 5 stars."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I deleted the app temporarily and when I downloaded again it forced me to make a candybarrrz2. I unlinked this page from my email and I'm receiving notification emails for my regular account but I'm only able to access reactivation for this duplicate account. I'm pretty upset.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Great app!! With slight network issues it freezes from time to time. You can't scroll up and down. Freezing all the time you can't even scroll. This app should require some maintenance. It's getting worse. Updated and it's glitching again. Less freezing issues and glitching then it's alk gonna be fine. It mutes the music when going on windows. Says tt isn't responding half the time. App is malfunctioning freezes all the time and update takes half my phone memory App is gone down crashing
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every time I click not interested in live videos, tiktok pushes more lives on my fyp. Explore page gone? Comment section is tiny. Then there's more disturbing things on here. It's becoming more like Facebook"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy tiktok, it's a great way to fill up free time. But I'm constantly having this glitch where my tiktok is stuck at an old version. My repost button disappears then turns up randomly which I find is really annoying and I'm missing alot of features. I've tried updating which hasn't worked and I've also tried reporting it as a problem but nothing happened. I'd would really appreciate if you fixer this."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app its so useful and teaches me things that I wouldn't know and the algorithm is amazing and based on your likes and super amazing for people to connect better then other social media apps because of the amazing features intergrated.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is CONSISTENTLY removing the feature to speed up tiktoks because they want more watch time. I was able to press and hold at the edges of the screen to go to x2 speed, now that feature is GONE for me, had the ability to press and hold anywhere to get more options, including the option to select the speed of the video, and now the option to control speed overall is GONE! That is not the case for my friends so I assume I randomly got picked to be a part of this so they can see how it affects us."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The content on the app is enjoyable and, sometimes, informative. However, the new pinwheeling screen transition between menus is headache-inducing, and makes using the app 1000% worse. I have tried reaching out to the support team in the app, but have not gotten a response, and there is no settings option to turn it off."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really amazing and I've been using it for years now. My only issue presently with the application is not being able to schedule contents as a content creator and a business owner. Sometime devices may not be available at the right time for contents posting, if this feature is added I believe it's gonna be one hell of an app for creators and business owners to enjoy. Thanks. Best regards, Odaf"

Can't even sign in cause of the pop up. Would rate higher if tiktok would actually like let me sign in on my new device. I've also would report the issue but 1 I can't sign in to report, 2 I can't report the issue from another device but I can't cause you can only report issues in the app, 3 the support pages are of no help with my issue"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is really good but of you have a phone thats not an iPhone you dont get the same features and have less filters and options (I still don't have tilt ok shop and dont have the option to post slide show pictures)
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's little glitches I get after being on there for a little while (for me 10+hours) it used to be a live video every four videos now it's a live every two videos,sometimes three and it's getting out of hand. I know it shouldn't be that big of a deal but the lives be so unhinged,so abnormal and it's just getting on my nerves it's like basically an ad and I also have ads too but only some rarely times when I open the app. I just wish there was a feature where we can disable the lives."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall good, but I'm having trouble with the ""repost"" feature. It only lets me repost and see who reposts videos when I initially download the app, once I close it, it doesn't let me repost, the button just disappears yet the repost ""tab"" when I go to my account is there. The repost button only appears once I uninstall the app and reinstall."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not laggy, it's not Constantly trying to have pop-app ads or have a text messages or anything like that and it's really good because. You can have like unlimited friends . These notifications that someone liked something or like someone. Like a post that you did. It'll just be on the thing that's. On the bottom of your phone or tablet or any other devices."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Scrolling through your favorites is annoying. For example, you scroll down and down and find a deleted tiktok and you press it to delete from your collection and the page refreshes you back to the start. It's so goddamn annoying, make scrolling your favorites easier please."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had tiktok since it was musically and always loved it and every update. This new update, however, has completely ruined the repost feature. It's annoying and inefficient. I liked being able to comment on someone's repost. Now though, to comment on a repost It's not gonna be in the original comment section of the video. I also can no longer download videos before posting them with the new update, which was a great feature to have. It would also be nice to be able to search slide shows."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constantly flooded with bots, content is repetitive. Would like a function to find real or even local/nearby people and content. Instead I get clones of real accounts following me, messaging me for information. There is no practicality in social function. The editing process is clunky. Could use extensions that provide more personalized control of the experience. Ads are also becoming more intrusive and annoying. Many more notes, but it is what it is. Safeguards could be better as well."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love the creators and art on the app, it's UI frustrates me to no end. With every update, I lose a feature that made things easier for me. I lost the timeline so I can't scrup through videos. I have no search bar for my following list so I have to search for people I follow in the main search bar, which is a hassle. When looking through people's TikToks on their page, the page will scroll down as you keep going through their videos. But doesn't do this on your favorites So annoying"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"they've pushed tiktok shop so much recently and now it's basically all I've had on my ""for you"" page. between the tiktok shop stuff, promo and sponsored videos and livestreams of those npc people I don't get almost any normal videos. and the screens for when you open your notifications now zoom in and out fast causing me headaches. making a tiktok with a sound now spins the entire page while it loads making me dizzy. do better tiktok"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app needs a feature to be able to hide persistent UI elements, I got screen burn in because of it. This is an issue reported by many users but nothing has been done to mitigate it."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Playback speed shortcut (long clock right side for faster or left side for slower) no longer works on Android (why would anyone click 3 buttons to speed up or slow down one video). this makes it unusable for me.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I will say tiktok has discriminated android users as they never added dark mode on the android where as they add dark mode on iPhone and an update to see my oldest favourite videos without scrolling all the way down. Tiktok should add an feature where we could just click and see our oldest favourite videos.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No support for age verification. As flattering as it is that you guys think I could possibly anywhere in the realm of 18, I am 30... I have restricted live features and can no longer see TikTok shop. I have reached out to support multiple times and never receive a response."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but for over a year now, I haven't had the playlist feature nor the story feature. I am on the latest update too!"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is honestly the BEST APP I have downloaded, you can watch videos or make videos and post them, but if you want to make videos and just keep them, then you need to sign up, but what if you dont want to sign up? Why did they change this feature??!!! Edit:LIES I TELL U, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Most of the time when i open the app it completely glitches out my phone to the point it don't want to turn off when i press the power button multiple times. Another thing is that the room for characters in the comments section is sometimes annoying because an opinion is bigger than the character limit resulting in me deleting the entire comment because that said opinion can't be summarized withought crucial details missing
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Kinda dumb that you can't change the aspect ratio on Tik-Tok. The videos I see on one of my phones fit the screen, the other phone I have I can't see the full video. The new update gives me the ability to go to the common to be able to see the full video, but I cannot see the full video the edges and everything, if I don't hold down to look at the comments"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kinda lame you can only comment 2 sentences on a post. Then report scammers and they send a message back talking about they see nothing wrong with the page. But I guarantee they want click to claim the prize. Constantly see adds that I said was irrelevant and didn't wanna see no more. But I guess it's better than FB but that ain't saying much.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have used this since musical.ly and I have always loved it but since the new update I cannot get into the app. Like every time I click on the icon on my home screen it flashes the black screen with the logo for a split second and then closes again. I am absolutely not gonna uninstall it, I have so many important drafts but I actually can't open the app. I'm so mad at this."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Android version needs dark mode. Bio should be 100 characters max, we should be able to block audios, and the blockable keywords should be increased to 200. Profile banners would be cool, too. Also, I'm getting videos with blocked words still appearing in my fyp. Maybe make the available features actually useable???"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was going great when they suddenly removed my ability to add a location which resulted in a massive drop in engagement. I reported it several times. They replied that using location is only available to select people when I HAD access to it just a week before, I explained this to them and they responded with the same reply. This is a STANDARD feature of any social media app and it seems like they don't want to fix it for me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and am still having the issue."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I can't with the constant disappearance of features I was using whenever there's an update. I can no longer make video responses to comments, now? WTH?

The new update though, when you click on a message or profile, the transition to the next screen is horrendous. At first i thought it was just my device, but it apparently is everyone. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to jazz things up or what, but, that definitely is a no go for me. Please take that out of the next update lol!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Repetitive videos popping up back to back even if I choose not interested.

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A Well made App, A good interface with texting videos and search bar. But the algorithm is a little unpredictable at times and can make the experience less enjoyable, also this app is being banned in some areas because of the way it's shown to children. Over all I give it 3 stars, I've been holding off on it, but I'm downloading it because its more popular. I recommend this app if you don't like YouTube shorts or any other short form of video."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would of never thought I say it but your developers are ruining the TikTok app with dumb updates. TikTok you should test a feature with people or give us a classic setting to avoid it. One star is for countless dumb updates. When you flip to the next screen now from a Live it makes me feel cross-eyed. This update is a true fail!

These issues probably still wont be fixed."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,tiktok you are saying my videos are not eligible for the for you page but my most recent vid is good quality and doesn't have qr code content and I've seen a bunch of other videos just like mine and there videos are allowed on the for you page that's not fair I'm rating this app a one star it sucks
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a amazing app, however. My repost button keeps being taken away for no reason, it's getting tiring having to uninstall and reinstall the app again. Please fix this"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The duet feature is not working properly. The speed is too slow. The mouth is not moving with the words.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has been a bug yesterday, when I taps on app icon - showing loading screen and app crushed. I get update in Google Play today, but this changing nothing."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,need to include a feature were you can block a sound or song. some songs play every second video and it's getting frustrating
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it would be very cool to add more features in the collections section, like to be able to group collections in a bigger file."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is good but it has removed the sound track of my favourite videos this isn't nice it's obnoxious please fix this problem for me and the features should be for every one not only some people
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I updated the app and now it wont even open. Even if I press on the icon in my menu it says ""App not installed"". It wont even open in Google Play. Im sorely dissappointed now"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Banned for no reason and no explanation, I can't get my account back and lost all my stuff, there's no appeal button and downloading data takes too long, It's impossible to get my account back and I was falsely banned for no reason and I did not violate TOS at all, tiktok needs to do better with moderation and needs to tell people why they were banned, I cannot access my account nor can I get anything from it such as usernames from friends or messages. do not download"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Tiktok but can you guys please add this feature where we can audio call friends instead of always just texting it would be fun to talk to friends that are on tiktok with actually talking to them on the phone

2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i love the app, it's smooth and clean. I use it daily and it's never bad. 5 Stars â­? And TikTok if you see this can you add a feature where we can put Gifs in the comments."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey TikTok fam! Loving the app, but can we talk about a game-changing feature? How about a delete button for messages even after they've been seen?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why in the ever loving hell would you take away a great accessibility option in the automatic captions for all videos? That was so incredibly useful for me! And now it's gone with no warning whatsoever! I used it constantly on videos without creator made captions. Making the app much less accessible is ridiculous! You're alienating users like me who use and often need accessibility features like auto-captions by tossing it out.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good app to use and I'm having great experience using it, but tiktok putting my videos on ""this video is not eligible for foryou page"" I'm a digital creator and been making videos for every platform using copyright free content from certain websites and there is nothing wrong with it in any other social media platforms but I'm having this issue that tiktok algorithm thinks that I'm not using original footages and videos please sort this out . thank you."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the BEST apps I've owned!!! Very good app, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in REAL FUN!!! There are benefits from this, you can monetize your TikTok account and many more... but it depends on the videos you post and whether it is different from everyone's content. I suggest that you hit the download button."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is an absolute time killer! I love spending time flicking through multiple videos to find a good one. There is so much variety on the app that there is a video for everyone! There is a feature that allows you to like videos and watch them again later, this is extremely useful for crafts or cooking videos.I also really enjoy uploading videos to my channel and shearing my content with others who have the same interest. It is very easy to creat and account and upload videos. For you"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Not sure if its my phonenor the app but every time i get on ge screen blinks and then goes completely dark on the fyp but not on my follwers page. And the lives ALWAYS skip when im watching.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No MUTE button! Worst ever! Muting on start of app NEVER works! Worse than Insta & Facebook with their policing. Take ages to address a problem! If u dont pay, u never get followers/engagement after your first few videosð¤·ââï¸?

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very very bad I see all the videos on it but when I upload on my account write on my video this is not illegible of for you page. finally I realised very bad just west of time
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Less options for tiktok android. Can't use dark mode. Very buggy sometimes a lot of features disappear out of nowhere with each new update.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App keeps freezing, when trying to upload it closes and it doesn't have a feature where i can link other apps after changing to business."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The video editing features are the most frustrating I've ever encountered - so buggy, constantly changing/moving options, no real tutorial about how it works or when it changes. The level of anxiety and frustration faced when doing the simplest edits makes it not even worth trying to connect with people online anymore."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is about racism on Africa and the other continent, the other continents has so many features than what we have here in Africa. I can't imagine how they do this to us please let us all have same features and same settings,if I can take my one star I will do than to give you."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have all in app notifications turned off and I'm still getting them every single time someone likes my comment. You go through the trouble of contacting support and providing screenshots and all they do it tell you to clear the cache, switch between wifi and mobile, or update the app. These solutions do absolutely nothing. Tons of other people have the same issue and have been for over a year. FIX YOUR APP."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app, recent update does make it very hard to use with the comment section coming from the side; this is very awkward to use and the ""heart"" symbol clips through the text often.... Using Samsung galaxy fold 2. Will update my review once addressed"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new features is so useless ðª I will not recommend anyone to update, it just showing blank and still my phone won't work perfect"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like it. But the advertising has gotten so bad. It's almost every other swipe. It's annoying. Wasn't like that in the beginning. I'm also starting to notice that when I like a video on a particular person's page and come back to that video later on, the like is no longer on there so you're having to press it again. Seems a little bit fishy to me because then feel like count isn't really authentic now is it? I started noticing this . And I go back to the exact same video."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"terrible algorithm. when reasearching something in the bar, scrolling too far gets you to a whole other topic. many videos taken down or shadowbanned for no reason. my videos dont appear on my page anymore. too many sounds taken down. too many people shadowbanned for nothing. too many children on the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unbearable to use anymore. The ""not interested"" button does NOTHING. The algorithm is 90% ads and there is stolen content everywhere. Despite blocking and saying ""not interested"" to every single football, fortnight, dumb filter videos. I keep getting them in my feed. The live videos are sex trafficking and the platform does nothing to fix it or stop it."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Definitely ain't going to install this app on the new phone until it adds a hide option of the buttons bar at the bottom. Got screen burn-in from this app.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I made my account and my repost button isn't there, but whenever I delete the app and redownload it, it's there but if i close the app and go back in its not there. And when people view my profile, it won't let me see my 'profile view history', it always comes up as 'profile view history isn't available'."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best feature I like most in TikTok is "" Use this / any template "" , and I can easily edit videos with just 1 click and it's a great way to spend my free time . It includes all kinds of good content including art videos , templates , videography , photography etc. , where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of I also speak my voice poetry . Thank you :)"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is starting to become glitchy again for me, for some reason I cant see the (new) videos I liked only the past videos that were liked a while back. I seen that it would show the new video that I liked for a split second and when I go back to it, it glitches out and removes it from the liked page. Still works in other areas just not the video liked area."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun platform to pass spare time watching vids, and be able to create content too! Just record, add effects, and post! Buuuut, there is no actual video editing in the app. Works well with the ""Inshot"" app for video editing, though. (It's the ""easy"" button to cut/paste/create and share to TikTok and/or other socials!)"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too risky interface. Like whenever you open this app, you have to carefully navigate and make touches so you don't do anything by mistake. The annoying poppvers suggesting people to follow, the suggested accounts being shown suddenly while visiting someone's profile, being asked to turn on the profile view feature for 1000th time, it just makes the usee experience worst."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app! But after the new update It doesn't notify me on the following page when my friends are live. Please fix this!!!
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using TikTok! It's a fantastic platform for creativity and connecting with a diverse community. The features are engaging, and it's a great source of entertainment. Highly recommended for anyone looking to share their talents or discover new content!"""
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ruined by updates. Fyp is completely irrelevant to my interest now. 'Not interested' function doesn't work at all - the same horrible channels keep coming back to back. Glitches a lot. More ads. Thumbnails no longer move as gifs. Tried clearing cache, internal to app & in phone. Uninstall/reinstall. Nothing works. Was enjoyable, now hopelessly boring. This seems to be a trend w/ other users."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app overall, but I noticed my swipe feature is gone, but it keeps going and coming back again, and I just want it to stop going away or just to have it back. So van you do something abt thattik tok,thank you"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Past couple weeks can't see liked video's on people's pages I follow it throws up a black screen Everytime I switch pages or click on followers. It's been slow and not loading. This new update didn't make it any better now I can't even access my videos or pictures to make a TikTok it only gives me like 4 pictures from my gallery and can't save drafts
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Please add a feature to sort saved videos by date. It's incredibly annoying to have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find something.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many bots selling headphones and push button fidget toys. You block them, and 2 videos later the exact same ""person/video"" but under a different name, pops up trying to sell you the item again. The algorithm should not only see what you like and show you what you like. But it should also see what you block, and block ALL instances of it."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a while now and with the latest update....Tf is with the spinning screen. Like it gives me headache and it's on almost everything with no way to turn it off. The app was ""fine"" well as fine as a declining app can be. They ban people for using legal substances but will allow cartel, war, and other horrid things with a simple color change to be shown to kids who just install the app. It's not bad when you get it to your personalization but the spinning... Why???"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The adds are annoying, my for you page is full of weird things even tho I always click not interested and I don't like them, It's always laggy, when I make videos in capcut and post in on tiktok it completely ruins the quality of the video. Honestly just an annoying app and it's fun to watch videos on but I can't make any cause they're very laggy and it's Honestly annoying so I have to rate it 2 stars. Used to be a great app but the updates ruined it for me."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why the hell are they adding ads for a tiktok?? That's insane. This is not YouTube, it's usually a 60 second post but even the 10 minute posts shouldn't have an popping out. I don't wanna wait those damn 5 seconds, keep it as something that pops up on our for you page (not in the middle of watching a damn tt) and allow us to scroll right past."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've enjoyed the app at first but it's logged me out of my account and won't let me back in. It's just been logging me into my other accounts. I've tried changing the password but it's changes the password to other accounts. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it's didn't work either. They also remove all the best features a lot. Otherwise the app is good.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Feed doen't refresh. I don't get content in my preferred language. Support doesn't react to my inquiries. No videos that match my interests are shown in my for you page. Content with words I filtered are still showing on my for you page
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app has either been bugging or there is a serious glitch, everytime I exit my camera on the app it freezes the camera and spins it?? I can't even explain it right and when I press the back button from profiles it shows like 3 different screens being pushed away, really weird. It's making me want to delete the app because of this issue."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The only bad thing is the privacy policy, there is no way to decline it and have less unrelevant ads, and the ads that you give is annoying, o hope you will make a decline button."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app constantly turns down my media volume by about 3 clicks when I'm not using it. Unacceptable! On top of that, my ""for you"" page ends after about 15 videos, and I have to constantly restart the app to refresh the for you page. It claims I've got no internet connection yet sits there and plays the live video I get stuck on."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I literally JUST updated it and now it's saying I don't have an internet connection and the comments section isn't loading, I cant like videos, and my profile also won't load. So sick of the constant bugs and nothing actually being fixed."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many scammers. Also, latest update has returned the icons over the screen when you zoom and let go so you cannot see the whole screen/text"

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is good interesting but i dont now why my account automatically stoped from direct messages due to spam and deceptive behaviour but i cant do anything in which spam and deceptive behaviour showed so i request tik tok team to improve community guidelines which stops my every account and i am really very unsatisfied please improve it this is too much now i am over now please improve it and give proper page and warn us before stoping direct messages from what wrong we are doingð¤ð¤ðððððð
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Yeah, I'm changing my review. Now that data for US users have transferred owners, the app is not the same as it used to be anymore. I am constantly showed the same lives. Vids that I previously liked or saw keep reappearing. That it's just annoying. Even if I used the ""not interested"" button. It STILL SHOWS ME IT. I miss the vids of niche communities. Or even more recent vids. I don't want to see vids posted months or even a year ago. FIX THIS YOU STUPID COMPANY!!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,In the past couple days 99% of my For You page is static images or slideshows. I tried resetting my for you page and it worked for a 5 minutes and then went back to exclusively showing me photos. This might break my TikTok addiction because I'm less and less inclined to open it knowing that I have the chore of swiping between 10 and 15 photo posts to maybe get a video I'm interested in.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The AI they use to decide if a message violates their terms of service or not is a buggy and needs to be fixed, because when I type the sentence ""I love you"" to My mother it gets flagged as inappropriate. but I have received messages telling me to harm myself and when I report them I'm told that there's nothing wrong with those messages. This is ridiculous. The moderator team also needs to get off their behinds and start to take down these clearly sexual pages."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I logged back in froma 6 months break from Tiktok. And. It's just gotten exponentially worse. There's now a shopping section. Ick. But the algorithm is still horrendous. I down vote every video instantly. And you can still only block 100 tags. How stupid. Most egregious of all I can't escape vomit inducing medical videos. For the same reason the app sucks. If you click on a person's page to block them. It thinks you've interacted with them and shows you more and more and more.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great but I'm trying to update it and it isn't, when I go to the play store to update it and press the update button it doesn't end up updating when I go to the app and I've deleted it two times now and installed it back and nothing has changed it's really frustrating and it's making me to lag behind and I don't like it, please find solution to it please ððð"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just got the new update, and I'd love to know: what's with the transitions between each tab? It's very unnecessary, like when I exit out of the add tab, the screen spins and then goes away? Sheesh. Also, I don't appreciate the shop section being placed between my 'for you' page and friends page. The shop has never caught my eye before, and it probably never will."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The only issue I have with the app is how you can accidently send videos. You could be scrolling on the app and you go to swip to go to the next video there's a feacher where if you press and hold for a slight secound you can send the video to either your friends or followers but it's a pain because there's already a share button near the like and follow buttons.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"interact with or even look up something you like, its never in your feed again. interact with something thats trending, good luck getting away from it, im fully convinced that the ""not interested"" button doesnt do anything. like i never watch or interact with any sports videos and i consistently click ""not interested"" when i see them, its been a couple years and i still see sports videos, there is no escape"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It works perfectly fine, scrolls with no problems, comments, likes, favorites, I can't search though. The whole app begins to lag so bad it takes several times of pressing my home button to make it register so I can close and reopen it. Really annoying when I'm trying to find things but I can't search anything."

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app, but I will give you guys a 4 star rating. An upgrade is needed. A Voice note feature. Add this feature to TikTok in the message section and my rate will turn into a 5 star."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would like to know why apps like TikTok constantly give updates that nobody wanted and either make it more difficult to use the app in the way that the majority of users prefer (removing the ability to ""hide"" in the comments if a video makes you uncomfortable or you would rather just listen instead of watch) or is completely worthless and solves no problems. Additionally, if I have auto update turned off, there should be NO reason why MY app on MY DEVICE changes without my express permission."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give this full stars if TikTok had the option to actually make slideshows. For users like myself, they never show up at all. I would definitely make more content if the website actually allowed everyone to make slideshows. Edit: I also cannot regularly type in emojis and can only do so by copy and pasting. This is very annoying and leavese to move it down one star. I should be able to use these features normally, it's a SOCIAL MEDIA. I'm very close to just moving on from here."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""update with better performance* BULL ð© ever since the last update its done nothing but brick my phone and make it crash every time I open the app, YT Shorts is fine, FB videos are fine, Instagram Reels are fine, but as soon as Tiktok opens nope, everything lags and the phone crashes, tells me my video failed to upload, hits try again, now I've got two of the same video on my page but i can't delete one because of the non stop lag."

If it does the opposite? I follow a few people, yet never any simmilar tiktok video gets on my fyp.. This is why I hardly use this app!"

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love tiktok but the giant grey prompt boxes are infuriating. ""Green screen your own video"" taking up more than half the page and making it impossible to see the content. No one knows how to get rid of this and it's on almost every video. Stop."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok content is great. Tiktok navigation is HORRIBLE. Why dosn't pushing the baxk button go back to the previous vid like EVERY OTHER APP?!? Why is watch history buried 4 levels in menus? Why can I not shut off like notifications? Why so many buttons and only select all or none? Would definitely be 5 stars for content, but negative one star for navigation!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great easy to use, lots different things and interesting stuff to watch but I think maybe there should be button we're you can earn tik tok coins by watching ads for free and also so that you buy gifts.I'm not liking the idea of having to pay just to go live and pay extra for the gifts and the roses I think spending money on the gifts and roses and galaxies and all that other stuff is more than enough to spend on money on but overall the is really awesome no problem with it all."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My repost button has been gone for like, a year. I do not know how to fix it, but overall, tiktok is the best app I've ever used. But, It would be even better if I had my repost button back. Still love it, though."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you try to upload a video using the editing feature, expect to try many, many, many, many times before it works. The app will crash repeatedly, and rarely saves your work. For being the biggest social media platform out there, it runs very poorly."

And of course, they can still report your live, and have you Mass reported. Tik Tok also takes 60% of live stream gifting revenue.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for quite some time, and it's been a go to for a quick time burner. But the latest updates have been pretty bad. The editing tools got worse, and the music library is smaller. Also, the app's been crashing more than usual. It's annoying that I end up staring at a black screen. They really have to iron out the record disput they are having. This is not including all the privacy issues they're going through. App's barely worth using as it is right now."

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love this app butl one thing I hate is that some features aren't available for everyone. I have tried everything to get photo mode to work and no matter what I do it's not available for me. It's available for friends in my area and every creator I follow. It's really frustrating because I'm a content creator myself and would like the opportunity to utilize these posts! There is no technical support either which is extremely frustrating

I shouldn't have to keep hearing the same annoying songs I hate that start trending appear every few swipes (or even back-to-back), same with filters I don't like that are potentially creepy and/or problematic."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was good and really enjoyed it but the new feature of the screen spinning like a transition has made it un usable anytime you go back a tab or hit the back arrow it spins like a slide show transition anytime I see it I'm instantly nauseous lightheaded and have a migraine it would be fine if there was a way to disable it but there isn't.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an absolute time killer! I love spending time flicking through multiple videos to find a good one. There is so much variety on the app that there is a video for everyone! There is a feature that allows you to like videos and watch them again later, this is extremely useful for crafts or cooking videos.l also really enjoy uploading videos to my channel and shearing my content with others who have the same interest. It is very easy to creat and account and upload videos. For you"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like tiktok because I was able to find something like a community there. But these days, I get 1-2 pieces of content before 1-2 ads and a live about religous or political pettiness. My fyp page has devolved into a combination of content I like and content I wish would just go away. Oh right, there's ways to say not interested, but of course that doesn't seem to do anything to change what shows up. It's an okay app"

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I closed to love this app. But now I permit it to access my pics and videos. I cannot post anything. Also, my biggest complaint is I post a video with music and it's silenced immediately. I take it from a page that's obviously not muted.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Imagine an app where 90% of the time it is being used, advertisements are shown. Imagine being Bytedance or whoever made this, having so much money, yet the likely underpaid software developers still fail to create a functional experience with even the most basic of social media features, such as following users, broken, and with a poor bug reporting system that struggles to upload a minute long video when the app is DESIGNED to upload and distribute videos.

2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is good. Very entertaining obviously. My only issue is android users get certain features forever after they're released.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are way too many unnecessary updates to the app. Removing pinned comments?? Like, cmon, the ""pin of shame"" thing wasn't that serious. Adding a dislike button? Nobody else would even see. Removing clear display on slideshows? That was just unneccessary. Plus, the fact that I can't just zoom in to activate clear display when watching ANY type of video; I have to manually click the button. Lastly, removing comments on reposts. Now I can't interact with reposts or see when my mutuals reposted."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app, in general, is a great way to promote a business or brand. However, the shadow bans and reporting of one's page should be investigated throughly by your organization. So you're telling me someone can easily sabotage your content without just cause, and this is allowed? In addition, PIP broadcasting on live videos is a violation of one's rights. I should be able to turn that feature off. To be honest, it's the main reason I no longer enter live videos. This feature is quite disturbing"

2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"(old) Tik tok is an amazing app, but the fact that so many options are only in limited areas is kinda pissing me off, let me explain, for example dark mode, now I don't really mind that, what i would love to have is folders, i have TOO MANY Favourites and I can't even reach the bottom that the app crashes, i wish we could have this feature in italy or europe in general pls tik tok I'm begging (New) THEY ADDED IT I'M SO HAPPY"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What is happening with this app? Everytime I go to a new page or setting it does some kind of transition. Like the screen will go in a circle or does a slide effect. It's annoying!!!!!
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One problem with this app is that, why can't it also switch to dark mode!? Like iPhone users does. Why isn't it possible for Android?? Please, this needs to be fixed. This app would be more great and improved if you just add the dark mode feature... And it's NOT fair that only iPhone users get to have it. But except for that.. this app is actually one of my favourite apps and I would highly recommend it ð«¶ð«¶ð."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It got worser people. Now there's a stupid effect that spins the screen every time you back out of a menu, which honestly makes me slightly ill. Plus, nothing is fully loading and is constantly buffering. If you don't want people to use your app just say so"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app it is really entertaning when ur bored and it does not have many problems for me but it only has 2 problem is when im watching it the page refreshes all by itself and its so anoying but everything else is kinda good overall i like it its not good and not bad ny internet is 5g and it gets very laggy idk why?Edit, it got worsening it never loads quickly like it. Used to do and it's frustrating Tok tok please fix this because for now I will give 2 stars please"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app very much I watch some useful and educational videos in it but I have a small problem which is there are some types of videos I don't like so I press ""not interested"" button but it seems like it's not working because these videos keep showing again and again and I am done with it I really don't want them to appear on my fyp. Note: I DON'T do searches related to this type of videos so I don't know why they still appear. Thanks"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just updated the application this morning and then I realised all of my respost videos have been deleted and it says network unstable even though my wfi network is high speed and correct... I tried deleting the app and signing back in but it seems not to work.. is their a way I can contact tiktok support team.. my other social media platforms work without a issue
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok was a fun for most times I had it, but I first uninstalled it because it was showing depressing videoes on my For you page. I took a break from it for a long while, after reinstalling it and things we're fine but now after hearing about the latest tread which i'm chosing not to bring up, I chose to delete my account and uninstall tiktok for good never using it again."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for watching videos. BUT it keeps asking me to sync everything with tiktok and its VERY ANNOYING. It's like ""press this button to allow Tiktok to sync with Facebook"" and if you click ""no"" it keeps asking you later. So annoying."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My favourite thing about this app is that the users are representative of the world. I see so many people with hair and facial features like mine. And mostly the only white people on my for you are movie stars it's pretty good tdc. It's lovely so far it's a bit complicated to learn the different functions but it's always fun ð¤ª
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I tap, ""not interested,"" forty times on a sound I dislike it should NOT show me videos with that sound anymore. If the feature doesn't work, just remove it at this point. The only way for me to remove or hide content that is gross, offensive or worse, is by blocking individual accounts. Your support says it will reflect it 24 hours, that's completely untrue. Even if I reset my FYP I'm stuck with the same obnoxious content for days. App is on the fast track to being non-functional for users."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey Tiktok! Please fix the feature that allows users to set a cover image for their videos in their feed. I have gone in and set mine only to have it unset to the first frame on my videos once I post. I love the app. It has helped me connect with a community of people that I resonate with. I just wish it didn't try so hard to suppress my small business. Almost 19k followers and less than 1% of my followers ever see my posts. Frustrating. Tiktok, do better."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Even with all permissions on it isn't letting me post videos. The ""Not interested"" button doesn't change my fyp so that's annoying. The ""don't show videos with this audio"" button doesn't do anything either. Otherwise I very much enjoy this app"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The watch live button when watching normal tiktoks just annoys me tiktok always glitches and then I go out of a video and it doesn't work I have to press it multiple times and then it clicks the live button and then I'm stuck watching a live until the x shows in the corner which takes forever and when I try and go off of tiktok the live still plays it's just annoying i prefer when you had to swipe left to view the lives and then click which live you want to watch
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever the app has an update, it crashes whenever I try to open it. Happened three times, each time I have to uninstall and reinstall, takes me ages to log back in and when I do I lose all the fun things that used to show on my for you page."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too much moderation. No easy way to filter foryou pages. If you don't like someone's content you can't just block them easily. If you like the subject and press not interested it assumes you don't like the subject. To block them you have to jump thru hoops. It also heavily pushes liberal political bias. Was not like this until after the hearings in congress in US.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What's up with the crazy transitions from screen to screen? Like why is there a need to move up or down to go forward or go back? Those are unnecessary interactions that just mess up the user experience. Can you just ge rid of them?
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am sincerely sorry to be forced to comment like this,,,,I didn't mean to comment badly,,,but what can I do I can't use the app at all.This app is not good.Its out as soon as I enter the app,,,video.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've recently started using reels more than tik tok. I watch tik tok to be entertained and it feeds me nothing but left political pages and trans pages. Since it ignores me when I tell the app I'm not interested in this creator and keeps feeding me their pages the only conclusion I can come to is they intentionally are feeding us divisive content that is the opposite of content we'd enjoy. I'm sure the goal is to further divide us. I'm done with it.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that.......
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is always glitching to the point where it's unusable for the most basic features. The crew reviewing reports on lives, videos and comments is a complete shame. Bigoted, racist, sexist, ableist content always seems to make the cut, but I'm about to lose my account access for calling out horrible people in a sensible manner. I understand that it's unavoidable with such a large platform but to take away access to those of us trying to make it safer is totally ridiculous."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad so far. Since I downloaded this app, I had two big problems. 1 the save button wasn't working and 2 the Favorite Playlist is not there. Literally is no there. I contact tech support and they have no respond for 6 day and counting."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Likes and favriotes dont save and dont work when you check them or favriote something to come back to it. The like button works HORRIBLY and won't let you unlike or not even like at all sometimes, also it lets people with your contacts etc see your account and recommend it even if you turn off contacts it will reallow after some time even if you click no. don't get this app it uses all sorts of tricks/scams and works really crappily"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pros: Excellent app. Works as expected. Cons: Sentences in the comments don't start with capital letters. Would be nice to lock the buttons. Its too easy to hit a button while holding my phone.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the repost button. it always constantly disappears for me and it's getting annoying. Edit: been a few months since this, YET AGAIN, they ruined the repost button. it has a white background, which I eventually didn't care about, but the idea was terrible, and they had no reason to but a white back round. now, they removed the feature to comment on your repost, which is even WORSE. this update was absolutely awful."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Rewriting cause ever since tiktok SHOPPPP it now feels like a dang shopping app. Can't even scroll on my for you page without seeing videos eligible for commission or tiktop shop linked to it, for what seems to be every other 3 videos. Same for tiktok live now its alot of people just trying to sell things. Don't get me wrong every now & then I do see something I like but that doesn't mean I want my whole dang fyp to be only shopping videos!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My phone is samsung galaxy a52s 5g and on my phone on tiktok some filters doesnt look the same as it looks on iPhones. On my phone they're all messed up and sometimes when i turn filter on my screen where i record got blured. I dont have option to save video but without the tiktok sing. Also i dont have some other options as other phones.. please my phone is from 2021 its not that old can you please update that mine phone amd other have new update ?
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lately there has been a glitch where my entire screen spins clockwise like 5 times every time I hit the back button. It's really annoying and takes a lot of time. And there are still way too many ads!
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app and how it has a option when you get on the app the videos are mute but I don't like how when you record a video you can look up the filters anymore like it will have the search button can you add that back please? And add more things too?
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm new to this app & I'm not one for posting a lot of videos of myself & still learning how to use this app but so far I like it. The Tik Tok shop has a lot of good stuff for pretty good prices & I have found a lot of good pages to follow. The only thing I don't like is the fact that people can make multiple channels that are the same name as someone else's page & you don't really know which one is the real page to follow! So I wish they had some way they could better figure it out
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"nice,, but it keeps adding updates then removing them. I used to be able to do the sliding images, but now I cant but my friends can?? so now i have to continue with the greenscreen which is weird if im not trying to sync to the music."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fun. Could be better. Don't like how tik tok forces unpopular content on my For you page. Especially when I have blocked ð« or dis liked similar content. That should tell you something. And it's sad and unfair that Tik Tok stops hot popular videos from going viral now, because they want us to pay money to get our videos momentum and attention. Not cool. :( Other than that, it's a great outlet for the people."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New Update Issues! The Add to Story button is gone, and the add a location to video is also gone. Typing on a video lags and you can't see everything you type. Submitted a help ticket to Tiktok, will update once I get a response."

I use to get videos that I loved and could go for hours on the app, now I get non stop sick and disgusting videos.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One star for putting the share to story button where the share button used to be. And for it being so damn slow after the recent update. Videos stutter and buffer a few seconds in. None of my other apps do this.

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Plenty anti drug propaga and of course they turn off comments for such things. As of late, It's been ""following"" people for me, shadowbanning the people I actually wanna see, The ""dont show videos with previous sound"" button stopped working because tik tok keeps banning audios and the no knife, no gun, ect polices like that are ridiculous. You cant even make an unboxing video without getting banned from this."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Download this app if you love ads playing every 2 videos and the algorithm putting all the TikTok shop videos on your page.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New to Tiktok. I got it on my Oppo phone and it was great - I really liked the powerful Edit where you can edit various things in the one mode, at various parts of the video (sound tracks, clip trimming, text, etc.). However, after I got a new phone (Samsung), I seem to have what feels like an older experience - the Edit is gone and now everything is separate and there's no longer one UI where you can edit all the different features."

The latest update has caused an issue, though. When opening comments the screen shrinks, which is normal.

Please reach out to me if you need screenshots and I will provide them for better clarity."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like using this to watch lots of content. However, recently, the translate captions and captions on screen are gone. When you go to languages, it just has you select your preferred language. I watch a lot of Korean content, and I used to be able to long hold the captions on the screen and translate it so I could understand what artists I follow were saying. It's disappointing to get rid of a feature that allows a more widespread audience."

Also when I liked all of the tiktoks on a person's page it only saved 2 out of the 100 tiktoks I just liked(I'm not double tapping then swiping without wachting, I'm sitting there the whole tiktok.) and it's happening a lot. It's just really annoying."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I won't lie I do have fun using tik tok but I don't love it and I think would if there were NO sponsored videos aka ads and NO live videos with in FYP. I scrolled to a live video and below that another live video and then 1 video and then a sponsored video. Every 1-4 vids is most likely a sponsored video or sometimes a live video. I guess if I AcCiDeNtAlLy press the live button on the top left then there won't so much but ð. Me uninstalling it won't make a difference but still gonna do it.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't know how to NOT see some videos yet. May be there's a filter that can help me avoid some videos, I don't know. That should not be complicated. A button accompanying each video asking if one would like to block similar content should be available."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad application for all my contacts and he said that I am 16 years old, and when I submitted an appeal and took pictures of my ID and photo, they were rejected. I did it several times and it was rejected even though I had my card and my appearance, and every time the feature was deleted."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good, but it seriously needs a video history feature. I was watching a video I was really interested in, and I accidentally pressed the home button, resetting my for you page. TikTok needs a video history feature ASAP.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"can the developers PLEASE decrease the contrast and brightness of the in-app buttons, the bright white is causing burn-in on so many new phones with OLED screens"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is god awful. Idk how it's become the norm. The interface is not intuitive at all and essentially you're being flooded with uncensored morbid nonsense. I don't see a dislike button like on YouTube nor a ""Not interested""/""Show less Posts like these"" option like on Instagram. So they show you what THEY want at their discretion. It's setup for doom scrolling/forever scrolling. There is decent content but you have to dig for it through the abundance of trash and BAD INTERFACE OF THE APP."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So firstly I spent 24+ hours on an edit just for it to be deleted secondly when I block someone they will still show up on the for you page thirdly people that you block will still be able to interact with your videos fourthly your drafts get deleted every year (I know my grammar is bad)

No matter how good you think your video it will go viral. It's like a system where only things tiktok wants to go viral, go viral. Download this app at your own risk. I'm saying don't. There a lot of stupid, manipulative, and messed things on here. A lot of toxic people on here. Now it spins when backing out of a page..."

I have a brand new Samsung A03, expecting all the latest updates and features with this app, INCLUDING a dark mode option. Well, to my surprise, you gotta do some stupid developer stuff to do it. Heh, and EVEN THAN, it DOESN'T, WORK. This feature is so common across all of social media, and lone behold, the most popular app on the appstore doesn't have it? What are you devs doing? Eating pizza and not even working? Lazy."

When I try to go make a new account, it just continues saying that my account has been banned even after I push the dismiss button. This is very frustrating to me, and I would like to know how to fix this"

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app has never opened on my phone ever since I bought it new almost a year ago. Never get past the loading page!
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The problem with titok it doesn't allow us to photo comment ð¬ because only cerent people have access with it titok u should just make it a feature in settings to allow photo commenting easily cause it takes time to join beta sometimes
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Often doesn't load the video of a video ony fyp. But music does start playing. When navigating to the creators page and click on the vid it does work.. so it's not a network issue.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is very annoying when you press the back button, the app plays the next video instead of closing. This is very manipulative and encourages addiction to this app, which is not good. It zombify people."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still no dark mode. Still slow and uses way to much data to the point I've only been using reels for the past year. Still can't block people (annoying when you keep getting recommended stuff you don't want to see especially when it shouldn't be on the app in the first place) also the not interested button stilk doesn't do anything. All these updates to add nothing? Seems like every other large media app that sucks at everything while everyone uses it because it's trendy. Add dark mode and block.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,latest update is SUPER buggy! its not loading videos anymore and if I click back it goes back to my FYP instead of to the previous page I was on (like my notifications)
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is a great feature but I don't have the option of direct message so please TikTok I request that we provide the option of direct message thank you
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The latest updates have been horrible, fully ruining my experience, with bugs, and removing features that had no purpose of being deleted, as well as adding some unnecessary and useless overall features. I'm not satisfied with the latest TikTok update. Edit: It's gotten a little better, but now the app sometimes randomly crashes."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Even after I have updated the app it won't connect to the Internet. It pauses every video it keeps saying my internet is unstable even though it is not no matter what Internet I use rather it be mobile data or home Internet and yes I have uninstall reinstalled and cleared the cache it does nothing.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this app. But all the buttons are harsh white on black, and WILL burn into your phonescreen."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Adds are everywhere. It's not social media it's a place for the corporation to skim off the top. No tab or private page is safe. They encourage harassment because view time is money and violence pays.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, I really do. But I just can't get over the fact I can't use certain features that everyone else can. And it's probably not a phone thing, bc my friend with an android can do things I can't. I just wanna make a slideshow man ð­"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't give some features even after updating, videos not going viral, also it is addictive...ð­ð­ð­ Followers keep reducing even if they have followed me"

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dude what the hell, the new update has made my app go crazy. On the newest Samsung galaxy anytime you hit the back button the tiktok screen starts spinning for like 3 full seconds. It literally feels like having vertigo and I hate it so much."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love tiktok, just one thing that really irritates me is that you can only have dark mode on iPhone and not android since it's ""not compatible"". I think this is really dumb due to the fact that not everyone has/owns a iPhone and that we don't get the same features that iPhone uses do, and when we do, we get it months after them. There's nothing wrong with the app, I haven't encountered any bugs. I'd just appreciate if you added dark mode for android, all the other recent updates are pointless."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the most recent update (Dec 25, 2023) the app has been glitching out whenever I swap between tabs (fyp to notifications or my profile for example) Very visually jarring and should be fixed. Please update to fix this soon."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Transitions haven't been working for days and no one will respond and there are no answers in their ""help"" section at all. I've cleared the cache, cleared data, checked for updates, and logged out. Nothing works."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app since 2018-19 ish. It is awesome! This is actually my first time writing a review for it.. I do have some complaints tho. With the reposts, you can't add comments anymore? Or that's just me, either way it was a great feature and should be added back. All of the good songs have been removed, which is annoying. I'm pretty sure thats out of your control, tho. That's all, cool app and I totally recommend."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is good it runs well and it doesnt lag much but my only problem is that filters dont show up? like normally you would see the yellow button showing a filter someone was using but it doesnt show up for me, how do i fix that?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update is buggy...missing features. Won't allow me to tag, and not showing correct analytics"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this app and I would use it more (and give 5x ð) but you have this weird feature where you show me stuff when I say (click) I'm not interested in the page from that very same page again and again. You should also allow pages to be muted while scrolling.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ive had pages taken for false accusations of being young I'm 36 I've had to start over n I er all the updates are a headache but I still love the app
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The 'not interested' button does now work. We should be able to block promoted content we find offensive.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App burned menu icons into my screen. Needs to be redesigned to fix this, I now have a plus button permanently on my screen. And then it completely crashed my phone, and it wouldn't respond until completely dead."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its a amazing app and i love it watching diffrent tik tocs is fun there have been some features added that ruined it but they have been fixed now and Its now much better
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pretty good besides the constant array of useless updates that remove useful features but they come back after a while so it's fine
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,its a great app i love itâ¤â¤ it is so interesting only dat we new tiktokers our videos do not go viral they are not added on the for you page
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please stop with those un necessary updates. I can't comment my reposts anymore the activity button changed again and it's ugly plus the little button to download your video to ur phone without any watermark or without having to post it is gone while it was very useful. So put it back please.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After several updates, the editing functions continually freeze, forcing me to start over with voice-over and any edits I've made. Of course, the algorithms hate when you do things outside of the app, but if I'm going to lose my content/edits each time within the app, I'll have to take the hit. The algorithms hide good content and continually show me irrelevant content. It has been a nightmare for weeks. I'm hoping it's fixed sooner than later. I don't recommend any editing within the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, I love being able to save TikTok's and watch them offline or send to a friend. But here's my problem, I heard of Message DM on TT but I have no way at all of using it! Plus I can't do the slideshow as in sliding the images, but my friends can do these things and I can't, I'm frustrated with it and don't understand one fricken bit why I can't use these features......... TikTok..... Love.."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. â¤â¤â¤â¤

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app is easy to use, and overall fun to be on, but ive noticed that my updates are well behind. i don't have the favourite or repost button, and i can only favourite slideshows, and only when there's a ""see more"" caption. on the topic of slideshows, i can't seem to make them when i try to upload a picture. i also don't have the photo feature, only video or text. its fun to use, i would just rather have all the updates up to date. if that could be fixed then i would change my rating"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Borderline amazing, very reactive and intuitive. A few points -1 Can't instantly see the date uploaded and number of views right on the page, would be handy, 2 When eg going to Chrome to check links etc. sometimes TikTok resets to the home page instead of staying on the particular video, 3 When searching for videos and reviewing them, it would be handy to see related searches in a more powerful way and to see those choices listed so they could be further looked at; a more 'granular' experience."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally a good app. Could spend hours watching videos. My only problem is that now and then, whenever I need to update it, it goes into some sort of trance where I enter and am immediately kicked off the app and back on my home screen. Fortunately the remedy is uninstalling it and reinstalling it again. I just wish I didn't have to do it for every update. Otherwise no problem."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whoever thought the spinning motion was a good idea was wrong. I am on tiktok a lot but I cannot stand the spinning of the video when I hit the back button. I can't watch anything without it hurting my eyes

So, now I'm going on the creator page, blocking them, then reporting it, but STILL I keep receiving live videos suggestions. don't waste your time.

Also you have naked women on videos but you are way too harsh on individual comments, giving warnings all cause YOU don't like what's said"

Bigotry flourishes while minorities have to tiptoe to avoid bans. Do not download this. Update: it sucks so bad, it sucks SO bad, do not download, it gives me a headache just trying to use it. Moderation is incredibly weak and the For You page breaks constantly. It just keeps getting worse. Wish I could give it half a star."

All of the people I follow mostly don't show up in my following page except for about 10 or so, and everyone is getting a lot less engagement. It's like you're basically shadowbanned unless you're selling something for the Tiktok shop. Lame."

I have to block as many people as I can and still it won't let me leave and still get notifications for it. It's harassment and annoying.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't see very well so I need everything in dark mode. Can't switch app to dark mode because I don't have the display tab in my settings. I updated the app and still not there. Apparently dark mode is only available to Apple users. Shame.

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ratio of amateur influencer TikTok Shop ads to actual content is ridiculously high now. The app is trying very hard to push their Shop feature, and it is pushing viewers away from even opening the app. Why try scrolling through videos looking for something entertaining to watch if the majority of your time is spent blocking thousands of accounts dedicated to pushing overpriced knockoff products that will never interest you while TikTok makes their ads the only priority for your feed?"

Please take this into consideration and fix this. A lot of people are upset over it. I want the old repost back!"

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Get a notification Read notification Tiktok cuts off most of the title in notification You can only see about 3 words but it seems interesting Press notification You get sent to the for you page You are not on the video you just clicked on You cant find the video that was the reason you got notified You dont know the entire title so you cant search up the video You waste a minute of your life complaining about it Delete the app already
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App crashes regularly, unable to find a video you just saw on your fyp without basicly liking said video. Almost 0 Playlist, no way of getting creators of your fyp off that page even though you tell the system ""don't show content from this user"" Also they pay their creators bad. So yeah wouldn't recommend, just watch the stuff on YouTube shorts where most creators re-upload their stuff anyway"

2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app..great platform for all ages. My one complaint is if you don't recall your login info, you can lose your old account entry. I changed my Facebook account to a professional page and this affected me logging back in when I bought a new phone. Lost 7000 followers. Had to open a brand new Tik Tok."

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm happy with the new moderation so there's more control of the racist nonsense that goes on with the app, but I think I speak for everyone when I think it's time for us to have the option to edit the captions in our videos? It would be a great help for when we forget a hashtag or accidentally press a button where we post accidentally. But yes can we please have the option to edit our captions? Lol"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the picture in picture feature but it gets in the way so we should be able to minimize it. Also, fix the algorithm.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had the photo mode thing when it came out but recently it's been removed for me and even after I've updated the app (multiple times) I still don't have it. no matter what I do I can't get it back. tiktok please fix this. I miss that feature because it's one of my favourites edit: photo mode still isn't available for me and tiktok has gotten so glitchy I can't even go into my drafts to delete them to make the app run better.

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok shop is a plague to this platform. Either make a partition or another app entirely for it. I don't want to uninstall but I am close. I've never bought anything, nor care to. Yet every 3rd page is a seller, selling cheap garbage."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The follow button doesn't work, and the app is generally slow and filled with bugs. The fact that videos automatically resume when the app is reopened is incredibly frustrating. This isn't a feature that should exist, and an option to stop this from happening would improve the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"probably the worst app in handling background operations, it kills the phones battery. this app is very poorly optimised. Some of my issues: Notification are a mess, sometimes i get them sometimes i don't. The Inbox screen is also a mess, loading is extremely slow, the clear display feature is hit & miss idk how it works anymore. Overall this app probably needs a rewrite from the ground up because of how slow and unresponsive it is Ps : add dark mode if you like us android users"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok took away my repost button , my following part is gone , I can't add on my story on tiktok. I've updated the app , reinstalled and took screenshots of my problem to tiktok but there has been no responses. Please fix this problem."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whenever I go to record a video I hold down the record button and it zooms in Automatically and it's just frustrating to record videos . SMH
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Love the app but update causes the phone screen to spin while closing out of videos or playlists
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm in this app is horrible, especially when I made a new account and never sync any contacts. The region section is WORSE. I come home to escape reality but I'm bombarded with useless/annoying content from my region. No matter how many times I press ""not interested"" and don't interact with said content, It's always on my for you page. Please remove the region thing. I can't even send screenshots to my online friends because they now know where I live. I'm definitely going to uninstall"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how tiktok will give features to iPhone but not androids. For example, I am unable to have slideshows or dark mode which is very disappointing."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really hate the spinning screen every time you back out of something. There needs to be a way to disable that feature. It's causing serious motion sickness.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The repost button disappeared and didn't come back I have contacted the support and they didn't respond to me
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app! It's pretty easy to navigate and upload content. However, I have filtered keywords to keep some content I don't prefer. They don't work for lives. Every time I accidentally click on the live button (my fault), the same lives show up, but they are specifically the key words I filtered. I continue to press ""not interested,"" but they constantly show up. It's a slight inconvenience."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"[EDITED REVIEW] so, I got this a while back, and at first I loved it, but now that I've had time to have it, there are a few things I wanna point out. It tends to take up a lot of space, and glitch out from time to time. I can't scroll two videos without an ad, and they continuously ""update"" it, in which they'll take away ALL features, before giving them back, with MAYBE one or two adjustments. In all, it's an okay app, and fun, but beware of the ads and glitches. âï¸"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fun, but incredibly unstable. TikTok is basically any other social media app, depending on what accounts you follow and interact with, you will have a lot or little to no fun. The problem comes with updates, every time it does so, it stops working properly, crashes and never opens. I always have to uninstall the App and reinstall it, which is... Annoying. I hope you can figure out what may be causing this error, and fix it."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Dear TikTok, I saw the latest update was around July 20th. This is the same time period my drafts started acting funny. I want to make you aware of this bug. I can't access drafts. It appears to be processing, not loading them. I can select them (or something), but I don't see what I am selecting, as the screen is blank. I thought I was able to delete them all, to start over, but it appears something is still holding the space. I am concerned bc all new drafts, saved, also end up this way."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm being asked to update the app whenever I open it on my phone, but once I'm redirected to the playstore there's no update button. Just a request to install the app on more devices... weird. I tried to uninstall the app and then reinstall it. Now I can not download the app at all. Looks like the update wiped out many users... Otherwise (when able to use) it's a great app. Very entertaining. Definitely a time thief."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a dicey app for me. On one hand, it's a marvelous app, with relatable and accurately recommended videos, but then it also brings things that I do not find relevant or interesting whatsoever. This is something I have come across quite often, and while not everything can be perfect, it has really took away from the experience. I hope its algorith improves, in all else, it is a great app."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app. Have for a couple of years now, but the last few weeks, my follow page is gone, I only have a for you page, and I hate it! I would like to see the my following page come back for more than an hour after uninstalling and reinstalling the app. This happened when he shop page appeared at the bottom of the app. Please fix this! Bring back my following page, and I could care less about the shops, I can save videos with shops I'm interested in."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I legit enjoy this app, and it is generally a mental break from the stress of Facebook. One challenge I'm having is with uploading my videos - for some reason, the option to add closed captioning is gone, and doesn't work for me, which sucks. I can't find where it is even listed as a feature to turn on and off. Also, my only other gripe is the amount of racists and crazies allowed to proliferate on this app. It takes away from my enjoyment. Otherwise, I love the way it allows people to connect."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, I think it's entertaining and easy to use. My biggest complaint are the static buttons that area visible while scrolling, especially the white ones (+, like, share,...). They got burned into my last phone screen, so now I'm afraid to use TikTok on my new device. They should definitely adjust the home screen so this isn't a problem."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The concept is great but the way its being handled is horrible. It takes so long for the videos to load, really easy to accidently refresh the page when in the middle of the video (literally an upwards swipe) and your overwhelmed with controls and options which makes it really hard to use them and understand them, are just some of the issues I've been encountering on a daily basis on tik tok."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that.........â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ð
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app I've had TikTok for pretty lang, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had update the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, i don't like the captains on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captains off but even if i turn the setting off, the captains will still show up. This is Very annoying. hope they fix the problem"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine. But poorly optimised for android devices. Examples include, but not limited to, the lack of voice filters as seen on Apple devices, inconsistent frame rate when using the camera and, not exclusively to android, the UI could be better functionality wise. Overall, it does the job, but with some flaws which inhibits android users to have a better experience."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good overall. I just have a suggestion: take a page from Instagram's book and add a collections feature for saved videos, audios, filters, etc. Thanks! Update: I've recently been experiencing issues with videos where they'd glitch or randomly stop playing for no reason. I don't know what caused it, but it never happened before last night. person found this helpful"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This a platform for all to show ur hidden talent. I like it. But some features should be changed. 1. video play one after another automatically 2. video should be arranged according to no. of likes. Always highest likes video in the first place. 3. ur unseen video should appear in first . After that seen video start. u can go direct to the list of seen video with the help of other button.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving tiktok a 4 stars because it is literally the only app I use all day every day and it is super reliable. it has basically changed my life. one thing though, I have updated it as much as there is to update, and I still cannot do the photo swipe feature. it just comes up with a video and I want it to make it so ypu can swipe through photos. I see other people doing tutorials and I don't have any of the features they do. I also don't have story mode anymore. I only have camera. pls fix it"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm was once so beautiful..... Now not so much. My fyp is now just 4 types of videos: clips of movies or shows split screen with gameplay, artists promoting their music/craft, meandering storytimes complaining about something, or standup comedy clips (also being promoted). The only reason I see anything enjoyable is that I built a good 'following' page in the before times."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Short cute videos, plenty of adorable animals, and some interesting facts and people. Some of them do get repetitive like the cliche girl with waist length hair in booty shorts doing the same dance everyone else is doing. WAYYYY too many trends. That's why I'm glad there's a ""for you"" page so it just shows you stuff similar to what you like instead of just showing you everything."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing , however I did have some glitches happen while using the app .

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is wonderful, but this newest update made it so that when coming across a slideshow (photo mode) and you pause it, it causes the comments to scroll up. I preferred it the way they had it before (when you paused it, you could still look through the photos but not hear the sound and without the bio and comments taking up the screen.)"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing. The the two refresh buttons are really annoying. I can't tell you how many amazing video's I have skipped because I accidentally pressed one of the refresh buttons. Also, why is there no auto-scroll option? Sometimes I just want to watch tiktoks hands-free (when it's cold, while eating) but i can't because I have to scroll every few seconds, please fix that."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok used to work pretty well for me. But, I'm suddenly having all kinds of issues. The ""not interested"", ""hide videos by this user"", and ""hide videos with this sound"" buttons no longer work. The same videos will continue to show up over and over, forcing me to block to user in order to stop seeing their content. In general, the app is becoming very buggy. Audio no longer syncs with videos, it has trouble loading comments, etc. It's incredibly frustrating"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good nothing wrong with it, but I still have many features and updates that didn't show but my friends features came in early.please fix this and add new features. I sent multiple requests and emails and never replied. user is monsterzzz just add the features. Everything nothing new just like the slideshow and full screen and auto scroll I don't have any of them."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm digging the favorites menu, but I'd love for it to be a playlist situation, i.e. you can select to make it private, friends only, or public, so people can see what you're adding to each playlist, and it would be cool if I could add a video to more than one favorite folder. It also makes very little sense that you can only message people if they follow you and you follow them, just give us a chance to reject or accept the message like messenger does instead pls??"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the most recent update, I've been having trouble with duets. Either the audio of the video I'm dueting is completely out of sync or it starts out normal but, when I press the record button again, there is a slight delay. I've tried everything. I've tried restarting my device, uninstalling the app and then reinstalling it, and updating, none of which has worked. I reported it to the help center but they haven't even gotten back to me."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is actually a pretty good app, I like to use it for motivation and ideas. However, there should be an option to turn off lives showing up on your for you page. Also, it won't let me delete or change the names of my favorited collections. Other people have also been saying that they can't even use the collection feature. I also keep getting kicked off the app and it won't let me back in unless I restart my phone."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like TikTok!! It's editing features are top notch, and I like how easy it is just to open the app and use it! Though there is only one problem: It takes lots of data and it downloads slow. It was at sixteen percent and the next minute, it stays at 88%. Overall, the app is still enjoyable and fun. I look forward to the new updates."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would have given it even less than 1 star. in fact for you there should be a negative rating system. in beginning I was liking it, but then. I used the inbuilt messaging software to communicate with my friends. and that has a lot of bugs, why dont you fix them! it has some keywords if those words are there in the text then the text does not appear on the friends screen. and the messages are received after so long. that messaging experience ruined the whole fun of using this app!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't access my inbox from Chromebook, which is why I installed it. Not only is it missing that feature, but this build of the app is actually LESS functional than the existing web interface. What's even the point? Literally only two buttons: home and discover. I can't even upload like I can from web. Also it crashes every time I try playing a video. Response: if I could keep the app running for longer than three seconds before it starts autoplaying a video and crashes, I might be able to. :P"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's not very easy to find the popular audio in order to use it, you can only find music when searching in the ""sounds"" unless you know the name of the exact audio you need (all the voiceovers, for example) Then there's the matter of the caption/hashtag/profile button/comment button/share button all sitting on top of the video. They can't be hidden which makes videos with text inside them really inconvenient to watch because you're trying to be able to read the words through obstructions."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only small improvement I can really think of is when I swipe over or click on a tiktoker's profile to watch more of their videos (cause they're in parts usually put together in order to make up one huge clip), I think it would be cool if you could find a way to give an option to go to that specific video. Like if swiping left takes me to that video on their page, but clicking their profile button takes me to their main page."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can you please give your users the option to remove or turn off the double ""tap again to exit"" feature. I like this platform a lot, but I don't like that it makes me feel trapped. I never accidentally close the app, if that is what you're ""trying"" to insinuate with this feature. When I want to close the app, I actually want to close the app. I don't think it's healthy for kids, which most of your consumers are, if I (a 28y old) keep getting sucked back in to scrolling into the abyss. Thank you."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app in general, but recently after using the feature once, the Connect LIVE to PC/Mac option has disappeared from my list of live streaming options. I can't seem to find any resolutions online and I've already submitted two reports that haven't received any response. I can't even find a way to re-apply for the feature. My rating will sit at 3 stars until this issue is resolved."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't bother trying to contact support. They won't answer at all. Two things I really hate about this app without getting a chance to even try other features: 1 videos auto play (at max volume). I'd rather have the option to decide whether I want to hear the video or not. 2 I was told my username was taken. Yet when I searched for the user who had it not a single profile came up. It's a unique name that's never been taken on any other social media site.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok provides a great experience, with an algorithm that tailors to what you want to see. You'll find some of the most unbiased information possible, and delivered in easy to digest bits. The only thing I find lacking is some of the features and settings are locked behind device model and/or region. On the plus side, at least they don't steal your info like *some* companies..."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update. The text to speech feature is gone and other features as well. I had try to contact support about this issue and i had no response at all. I use this feature for all of my videos. Needless to say it had been a major setback. For the rest i love the app, I'm willing to fix the reviews after the issues with last update are fix."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! There's barely any problems i have all of which are very minor and can be solved with an easy fix. One being the just watched feature, whenever i click the button it either loads for a minute if that isn't what it does, it will take me down to the video and then take me back up. It gets quite annoying but it's easy to manage most the time. Other than that and other things i don't care much about this app is great! Keep it up."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I confidently/strongly suggest there should be an option to block audios. I've always enjoyed tiktok as a way to lounge after a long day, but at this point I can only spend not even a few minute's on there anymore. The newest trend always attaches to a specific sound, on my page every other video. Sometimes the sound get's so overused, so repetitive, I genuinely find myself wanting to delete the app. If I could block audios, I would enjoy using what used to be my favorite app, again."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best media platform ever, there's so many different things to make and do and watch, you can do lip syncing, dancing,funny videos and more!! Plus you can customize what you'll like to see on your for you page (you'll see) very easy to see what's trending. I do not recommend this app for anybody under 13, because you can text random people, and there is some bad things in videos on the fyp such as cuss words but it's good ãð?

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's great, but every couple minutes, it lags and crashes. This problem has been happening more and more often. Reloading doesn't work, relaunching doesn't work, and now my only option is to delete it and then redownload it. Hopefully that works. Update: It didn't work. Now every vid I scroll to turns the screen entirely white, and when I view a page that isn't my own, the fyp goes completely black. When the vids aren't glitchy, the sound is. This app has become a bona fida shitshow. I'd give 0â­?

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really liked it the first time I used it. Which is good because that is the only time the app would let me use it. It keeps telling me I have no network connection even though all my other apps are working fine. Tried all the fixes on the web and YouTube with no luck. Sent a message to TikTok using the ""Report A Problem"" feature and haven't heard a word even acknowledging that they received the message, let alone anything like a solution. Too bad. I really wanted to get into this platform."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please integrate a feature that we can watch the videos with whatever sounds that are included like talking but the ability to remove the songs. For example. When you tap on the audio and it's that awful oh no sound... I can be taken to the page like it is now, BUT I'm able to turn it off and NEVER hear it in another video ever again. That. Would. Be. AMAZING ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So. It turns out tiktok made this relaunch app thing and it basically makes the app less fun. You can't comment on videos, you can't search anything cause there is no search bar. You can't even change the settings because they removed the settings button. All I wanted was to be able to search up the kind of sound and dance. That's allð­ I don't like this app at all."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app truly. However, I'm giving it 2 stars because photo mode keeps getting taken away from me. I haven't had it for a month and a half now. I have tried reporting it as a problem multiple times, but I keep getting the same response that they are working on rolling it out to all the users. I think, i stead of giving us updates every month that change the layout and appearance of the app, they should work on making sure every user gets access to the same features."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"so, tiktok is a decent app, but with a few downsides. First off, if you have an AMOLED display, be very cautious. it can give you a burn in, and it will. i am speaking from experience. take all recommended pre cautions to avoid one. two, you can and will lose track of time, if you're watching it. it can be very addictive and seriously change the way your brain functions. could be better but it could be worse. i personally have no problems with much else."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing ,however i did have some glitches happen while using this app .for example , when you press the button to record a video with a sound,the sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position, and no, on the camera app this have naver happend.this glitch has been occouring about for 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but no often. I hardly ever record videos anyways , but I do however post edits , it works just fine, so it doesn't really bother me that"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened but my For You page is horrible. It keeps showing me videos that I don't like, or Tik Toks from the same people. I've tried everything, clicking the ""Not Interested"" button, interacting with videos I like, but I'm stuck with these horrible videos I don't want to see. It's frustrating, I just want to have a good time in this app, but it's only stressing me out."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When you make a certain video as uninterested and it gives you the little ""we'll make sure to show you less of this content"" it doesn't actually do that. I've had to do this multiple times. I could care less if there's a trend going on, if I don't want to see certain topics/videos and I put the filter option on that I don't want to see something, I shouldn't see videos relating to that topic. It turns your ""for you page"" into a ""not for you page"" since it continuously keeps showing unwanted vids"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. I came Errors occur while using the app. for the For example when you press the button to record. Video with sound when the sound plays. The camera is only stock in one position .no more. On A camera app has never been like this. This The error is happening for about 1 month. And a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I Anyway record video anytime but I do. However post edited. And it works fine. So It's not really me bro. viral my videos ð thanks
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. The main issue I have with it would be the notifications. Every time I go on my phone, Iâll get a notification like â?username* liked a video you repostedâ? but when I enter the app, it wonât appear in the inbox no matter how many times I refresh it. Also, one thing Iâm sure a lot of people would appreciate in a âgo to bottomâ?button the favourites. I have a lot of videos in my favourites that I would look for, but theyâre all at the bottom, and it takes some time to scroll there."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constantly crashing, the app itself is what it is. And im happy they put in the feature where you can see past videos. But the app crashes Constantly. Either you will be watching somthing and the video will stop and it will refresh. Or you will be searching for a topic and the app freezes and crashes. Think there is a bug in the app and should be looked at. ð¤"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay and all, but an bug i recently encountered is that whenever i press and hold the screen to bring up the menu to add the video to favorites and others doesn't appear. Once that happens I can't exit out of it, neither does switching to ""following"" or ""for you"" fixes the issue I have to close the app and open it back up. I'm not sure if anyone else encountered this issue but please fix it in the next update."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty great, however I wish there was an edit feature. As an artist it takes tons of time to complete a drawing, so I'd like a feature where you could save your video, come back to it and continue. **Update: they have added this feature however, I noticed my captions has disappeared and I no longer have to option to turn them on or off. The option is simply gone."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really good video and a lot of things to do with cooking, funny, horrible, everything else to. But when I swipe left the screen just stop and froze, so I wait for 1 minute and it kick me out when I go back & do again same happened again. I reset my phone to see if work and nope still doing it. I checked update on tiktok or my phone and no updates."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has many great features and the amount of Christian study programmes, comedy, information, services, products on it are excellent. However, the sounds that people quite often use on the short clips can be annoying and distracting. This is something to watch out for. The reason it can be annoying is that it spoils a good video. Overall though, it can be a nice to sit back and enjoy the time on it. The best features on it are : Biblical studies, language, mathematics, comedy and chat."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this app but the video stay stuck while the audio goes. Also when you're recording it kind of glitches a little like it gets stuck. This is only happening since the new update. The tick tock update. The old musically worked perfectly well for me anyways yes I love some of the new features yes I will continue to use this and yes I will just have to grit my teeth and deal with it. But it makes it very difficult to make a good video
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do enjoy Tiktok, the communities I've found on there are a ton of fun, but I don't like how updated are rolled out. They'll roll out a feature that quickly becomes popular, like photo mode or the new voice changers, then leave users who didn't get it initially hanging. I want to join in on trends that simply aren't available to me because of some arbitrary choice. It's an unfair system which doesn't promote growth equally. There seems to be an Apple priority too, which further proves my point."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be rather easy for me to navigate and use, but all of the sudden the format of the app has been randomly changing for me throughout the day. At times, the app won't let me repost or upload stories to my account, and completely hides those features from me. And at other times it will randomly grant me access to those functions. I have no warnings or strikes on my account. It's become extremely aggravating for me to use now because it's switching back and forth from being out of date.."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit 2. After 2 Used primarily on tablet. Now it will not stay on landscape mode. I will update it to good or 5 stars once I am able to use it again. Fixed and some features added. For a time wasting app, this was great. Easy to use, easy to just look at videos and have a good time. Content for everyone no matter your likes. I gotta say I was impressed with the cheer amount of silly and funny videos."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, it's amazing and inspiring but things are getting annoying because of the new updates, like not allowing us to use our own audio and taking away some filters. And also the app has been crashing for five days, it won't log in, please fix the problem. EDIT:why do I suddenly have Israelis in my following page??? I DON'T FOLLOW THEM!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the app is very good, but it should give you the option to change what page it opens on, since not everyone wants to start on the For You page. It should also have a button or something that temporarily hides the UI when watching videos, because while there *is* a feature that lets you watch the video without the UI, it'll probably result in part of your hand covering the screen. Additionally, some features are only available in certain regions, which is just awful imo."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, but I hate waiting for new features. For example. I have an android, and I am stuck waiting for a Playlist option. It is just not available for me....at all... It is frustrating to me, but honestly that may just be my ASD/ADHD brain looking to organize my video better... Everything else has been good so far. And before anyone asks yes, my app is up to date, and the beta program is full so if it is a new feature that is not available to everyone just yet, then stop theads."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The content on tik tok is ok but there are a lot of functional problems with the app itself. Firstly, the coments and captions on videos have a character limit that is too small. Second, there is no way to find out when a video was posted unless you look at the comments. Third, the for you page will sometimes reload and there is no way to find videos you havent liked. Fourth, the message ""youre tapping too fast. Slow down!"" appears when I try to like a video no matter how long I have been online"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No privacy whatsoever!! TOOK MY CONTACTS WITHOUT PERMISSION AND RECOMMENDS THEM TO EVERYONE, THAT'S UNACCAPTABLE! disgusting! - - - - MINOR: links crash into feed, back button just switches to previous video, sometimes when i leave (and close the app) it keeps playing audio, this is terrible when i am in public, switching off the screen doesn't help, i need to manually enter into the app again and close it through active apps menu."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As a TalkBack user, and a blind listener at these videos, I really like it. However, there does need to be some accessibility workarounds. A lot of the buttons are unlabeled, so if you can work on that, I would very well appreciate it. The app is good though, but it's four stars for accessibility. Keep doing what you're doing, and I do like the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderfully addicting. Update: After a long time using this app, I realized that when duetting someone with Bluetooth headphones, there's a delay in your microphone. I don't know if this happens for anyone else but it happens for me every single time I try to do it. And I believe to fix it the creators or developers should add a feature when you can manually adjust the timing of your audio, that would be amazing. But that's it, thanks for reading."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app and I feel like there's something here for everybody. Especially since this app seems to be based on an algorithm so it makes finding videos you like extremely easy. I have a couple of issues with it though. Specifically, I feel like certain features could be added to the app that would make it easier to manuver around. Features like a playlist function, or an ""episode"" function that would make it that a creator can link multiple videos together if there's multiple parts."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! There's barely any problems I have, all of which are very minor and can be solved with an easy fix. One being the 'just watched' feature, whenever I click the button it either loads for a minute. If that isn't what it does, it will take me down to the video and then take me back up. It gets quite annoying but it's easy to manage most the time. Other than that and other things I don't care much about, this app is great! Keep it up ^^"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love tiktok, but since 2 weeks it makes my phone bug. When I open the app, it stays on the menu (just Tiktok is wrote) and then when I switch off my screen, I can't access my phone back again. Even if I restart my phone, I still can't access my phone! I've been trying to fix this issue by myself by uninstalling the app and install it again but it actually doesn't work. Please help me to fix this issue, it's really annoying"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like the app very much. The only problem I have with it , is it's storing a ton of temporary data on my phone, that I have to constantly clear out. Some things that I wish were improved, is the interface, I wish I could get rid of all the writing that covers the video while I watch it. Along with the option to select a sort of ""genre"" to load for videos for you specific tastes for the 'for you' page. Instead of it going by which videos you watch and react to."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm is good and I have no problems watching content, but creating my own content is where there's issues. The voice effects weren't available to me until far after those trends died out. ""Photo mode"" for slideshows is completely unavailable to me. I have reported problems to tiktok and they basically told me that some users just can't use certain features, so I'm just SOL. The app is still usable, just makes me not want to make content."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The updates made everything change. Before the updates, the app was good and everything worked perfectly fine. Once the update happened though, the functions wouldn't work that well, at all. For example, I put a video as favorite and later on decide to unfavorite it it won't, same with the likes and following. When I try to share, duet, or switch, the app crashes. I also can't change any of the settings or anything involved with my account."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Don't know if it's just me, other people, a glitch, or probably a license kind of thing, but whenever I click on the sound to see other videos that used it, some of them would say ""Sound Not Working."" But if I search the sound physically instead of clicking on it from a video, the page pops up perfectly fine and I can listen from there. Some work, and some don't. Can you please fix this? Great app btw, too bad it's getting deleted eventually..."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app for entertainment purposes is great. However, if you try creating content you might not have the same experience. My video editing features did not receive the update despite numerous troubling shooting and having once had it (somehow reverted?). I've had an open ticket with the support team since November with no resolution in sight. Can be extremely frustrating if you ever are in need of help and can't find an answer from other users"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's a hellscape of content being shoved down your throat, with an archaic algorithm, and buggy video editing. However, it is much better than the video editing that I already have ( which is none) and honestly, I have a good time with it, so long as I remember to search for things that I like, rather than use the for you page That automatically comes up."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I spend too much time on this app, and I've noticed that they removed the slideshow feature for some tiktok creators, myself included. It's very frustrating, especially since sometimes I just want to create a slideshow that other people swipe through. It's completely unfair, and then tiktok has a tendency to gatekeeper features from creators until they're 'popular' or 'trending'. The algorithm is great, but there's no incentive for me to create and share, which is a big part of the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointed with the recent update of the app. The drafts, sometimes the apps doesn't want to open and you loose all your drafts because you have to uninstalled it. Like why? You can't rerecord later in the editing process, making it hard if you want to change customs. The stories sounded like a good idea at first but now if you are trying to save as draft and you accidentally pressed the stories button, goodbye. And what's the point of the feature? You can't shared them. Ugh."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but only as long as I don't want to see my personal messages from friends. I click the personal messages button, I see a list of people who sent me something, I click on the chat with the person and that's it, the app freezes, stops responding to touch, and after a few seconds it crashes to the desktop. Developers, please fix this bug."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a garbage app that functions poorly. I signed up, and made sure to verify my email. Then I was unable to follow anyone and unable to receive messages. I only wanted to sign up cause my roommate has it and is constantly sending videos and tiktok is always begging me to use the app 'For a better experience'. This is what they call a better experience? That's laughable. They need to fix their stuff before claiming a 'Better Experience'."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, especially once you've been on for a while and have a ""for you"" page which is actually content you enjoy. However, the app is plagued with bugs. For one, I cannot stay logged in, meaning that if I close the app even for a few seconds, I have to reautgenticate. It seems that every other update the app breaks, forcing you to clear cache, reinstall it sometimes just wait for a fix to get pushed. The app itself seems to frequently get bigger down and freeze even when it is working."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It can get toxic sometimes, but the very supportive side makes up for it! Overall the app is great, but if you could, could you maybe add a feature where I can delete multiple TikTok videos I've made at the same time? I really don't wanna go over 83+ videos to delete, plus the embarrassment so it'd be super helpful. If not it's not a big deal, I still enjoy this app."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). Tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying, hope they fix the problem soon :)"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing on this app is terrible! When editing a video & trying to set the duration for each clip, when I go to play, it will skip right over certain parts of the video. It lags so I have a hard time keeping the timing in sync with the music. I hate that there is not ""edit"" button for your caption once it's posted, what happens if I misspell a word or my predictive text changes a word for me that I didn't want?! Changes needed ASAP, it's so frustrating.I'm trying not to give it up all together!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, there are too many bugs, likes keep dissappearing, and saved videos as well. I like the app, but the customer support team is unfortunately absent most of the time, closing tickets without a resolution, and don't let me get started on the effects that are always missing with every update, even tho they mention adding those features. It needs a lot more attention from my point of view"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Real people being real funny. App itself is pretty good, but could use a couple features. If they could combine the some of the web app features into this app also, it would be MUCH better. After 3 days, I did start seeing ads, but it's only every 4 or 5 videos maybe. It would be better if it was easier to tell the difference between ads & videos. (They are marked, but most times you're too busy giggling at the previous video to realize the next one's an ad. Just a bit more noticeable)"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it the features and funny effects on it. I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but the ads that pop up, are sometimes really long. Let's say a skin care add, is like 2 minutes long. Sometimes it won't let me scroll up on the adds and when I restart TikTok. I get the add again. I had to restart my phone multiple times for the add to go away. Sometimes the adds can be like 10 seconds. That's my only problem. After all great app I recommend it. ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is great, but recently for some reason its not letting me switch my images to photo mode, the button that's supposed to be on the bottom middle of the screen doesn't show up, so I can't upload the photos I want to, I've tried everything I know, unistalling, reinstalling, checking for updates, litrslly everything yet for some reason its just not showing up, and other people have the same issue as me. Can you fix this?"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, however I did have some glitches happen while using the app. For example, when you press the button to record a video with a sound, the sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position, and no, on the camera app this has never happend. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I hardly ever record videos anyways, but I do however post edits, and it works just fine, so it doesn't really bother me that much."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried updating, deleted and installed tiktok on my device and I've gotten none of the new features I see others talk about. Everyone else has the new voice changing filters. Any time a new ""cool update"" comes out I always get them months after. All I've gotten is a buggy freezing screen any time I'm editing a video on the app. Update: Not only do I still not have the voice changers but now I can no longer edit my recorded videos in the app at all. I cant split, speed up, or duplicate."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is pretty good but I have a couple complaints. 1. Sometimes my tiktok freezes and I have to turn off my phone and turn it back on, which is weird because it doesn't happen on other apps. 2. Tiktok sometimes doesn't give your certain features like the Jessie filter for no reason, I had it once, then it disappeared. 3. Holy the moderation sucks, I seen gore on the app multiple times but you can't swear in the caption. It doesn't make sense. My rating would be lower but I like this app."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tik tok, there's just a few problems though. I won't get certain notifications, like when people upload videos and when people follow me. that is not a big issue though I wish there was a recommend section for sounds. I can't find a lot of songs on it and it only shows 30 seconds. I'd appreciate it if we could have the whole song to choose from and more of a variety for sounds. Preferably, I'd want more vocaloid, but the recommend section is all I want. Please put into consideration."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There should be a feature or a button in saved videos where we can search the name of the collection when saving another video. I have LOTS of saved videos and collections in my account and when saving a new video, it's harder to scroll through all the collections to find the collection where my newly-saved video will be put. It's more convenient if it has a searching button. Thank you."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for passing time. Recently though I've had some problems and I dont know if it's because I'm on android or what. 1 the watch history opinion always disappears and reappears at random and its frustrating. 2 there was a faster way to share videos by holding down the middle of the screen and it would send the tiktok instantly, but now it does the same thing as pressing the share button"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I tried to shoot with a sound it had 0% on the screen and then it sent me back on to the home page. Also when I went on to my account page where it tells you all your details it said 'Unfortunately this app has stopped' please fix it. One last thing is that you can only do a live stream if you have 100 fans or over, that's a little unfair."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Down to one because it's incredibly glitchy. Fix the update. The algorithm sucks; I see the same 4 people over and over again despite trying to ""fix"" it. The search bar across the top of the screen is annoying and just takes up more space. The new draft page layout is irritating because you can't make another video with the same audio like you used to be able to right from the draft; now you've got to search for the audio that you were using every time you want to do a new take."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok is a great platform. Initially I thought it was only young girls dancing. However, there's a ton of other content: political views, sport, how to stuff, comedy, conversation starters, art. Such a variety. The app itself could have more features or be more intuitive on how to use it. I find what you can do with it a little limiting. But it's totally worth having and very entertaining."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's fine. I'm neutral on TikTok I've had no problems. I enjoy the straightforward GUI. I have no complaints. I would give it a higher rating but I simply choose other social media apps. I link with tiktok but it is just not my number one. although there's nothing wrong with it. it's A grade just my personal preference isn't tiktok RIGHT NOW. Might change. Many great features. Please try it ..
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is addicting. Highly addicting, but I love it. I've met so many great people on this app and learned a lot about random topics and myself. However, they don't make it clear on how to access certain features and the monetization is literally pennies. I would like to be able to create a playlist as well as have a stream key to go live on my laptop. I have reached out numerous of times and they keep saying ""be on the lookout"" without any follow up. Other than those gripes, it's a good app"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I normally love tiktok, but after the most recent update I can no longer go back to drafts and re-record clips. It just doesn't play the sound I chose at all, so I can't lipsync to any parts of videos I meant to come back to and re-record. I used to use this feature all the time by clicking on the ""adjust clips"" button, but now that's changed and the new feature is obviously buggy. Please fix this!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Just a quick question. I was trying to edit a video and found that the text to speech option comes and goes . I have the text to speech I just don't have the option to change the voice . And I've made sure the app is up to date so i just don't know why its not working. Oh and also it would be nice if everyone had the same editing features. Allowing them on some phones but not others gets really annoying. I'm just talking about tiktok's editing not getting other apps to edit clips .
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Previously would have rated a four or five stars but after the recent update, I lost the feature to favorite videos. I had entire playlists and videos favorited that I wanted to remember (some of which I had put there months ago) and now I'll not be able to find them again because they're buried in my liked videos. I could have lived with this if it wasn't that the feature isn't there at all and I can't even favorite videos anymore at all. Update: After a couple months the issue was fixed."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Content is what you'd expect from a zombified Vine app. My biggest issue is the user interface/usability of the app. The video progress bar is so close to the home button that most of the time when you go to restart a video it refreshes the page and you never see that video again, it is honestly the most frustrating thing about using this app. Once you post a video you can't edit the captions at all, your only option is to delete the video and repost it. Needs work that's for sure ð"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was working fine until 2 updates ago. Now, the screen is zoomed in too far, cropping a lot of the videos, and making the icons waaay too big.

Frequently getting no internet connection error. Something is seriously wrong with it."

TikTok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying. hope they fix the problem"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok app has brought light to many home and creators round the world. The most amazing part of it is that it's user friendly, even the less experienced person can easily navigate and start exploring through the platform. And It's ability to record and then edit a particular video without looking for an external video editor or a professional to do it makes it more exceptional to every other social platform. I will love it if the management can add more effects and features in future."

Sharing and saving are two completely different actions and should not be part of the same menu, some of the most awful design out of any app I've ever used. UPDATE: I can't believe after literal months that this is still an issue, on top of that the auto generated captions setting is broke"

It tends to happen at random times. When I try to scroll to the next video, the screen will buffer/load from the bottom of the video then it'll slide back to the current video that I was scrolling away from. This isn't the 1st time this occurred. It used to happen alot a couple months ago, but it stopped. Now, it's starting again. How do I fix it?"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, i love it personally but it has sucked since the last update for one reason. Sometimes creators put word boxes on, and it's where the hashtags and @'s are, when you'd hold the screen to bookmark or save before, there used to be a box so you could still read what the words said in the video, but since the last update you cant. It's rather annoying and I've had to skip over many videos because I can't read it. Please fix this."

After an unspecified period it tends to automatically lock out users for unknown reason(s) and delete their account(s) entirely only permitting them to establish a new account in Private setting. Indeed, this happened to me yesterday (06/23/2022). This is somewhat irritating and I advise to think carefully before risking an experience similar to or exactly like mine."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The android version of this app lacks many things the iPhone version has. Some filters/video effects don't work, dark mode and the ability to toggle captions on/off is gone. Captions used to be able to be toggled but that changed after an update. I don't understand why but it's very annoying. It's clear that tiktok doesn't even try to fix the Android version of their app. Pathetic. There's no excuse for high-end androids to not have the same features as iPhones."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot back out of the app cleanly. My sister will text me multiple tik tok links, and the only way to open them is with the tik tok app. Even then, sometimes it gives you a totally different Tik Tok before the one linked. When I try to back out and get back to the messages app, Tik Tok just gives me another Tik Tok. It's a scummy way to try to force users into engagement and boost watch time. I'm surprised this kind of ""feature"" is allowed on apps in the Play store."

It refreshes pages in the middle of looking at them, on everything from Tiktok to Google. Problem stops as soon as I delete this app. I waited a month and tried again, boom, same problem. Between this and the option to get random sounds being gone, there's just no point. I'm so disappointed."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like the app, but pissed that they took away the option to add your own music from your music library. The song selection that users are now forced to choose from isn't the best, so the developers have effectively blunted the usefulness and enjoyability of this app by stripping out a really convenient feature. Otherwise, the app is fine."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So you updated the app but didn't add a fade away feature for the onscreen controls/buttons? They should fade out like after a few seconds so that I have the whole screen for viewing without impediments... They are constantly in the way of the content I'm trying to view. A lot of the times they block out portions of what I'm supposed to be seeing. Also, the app needs a specialized volume control so that I can mute or turn down the audio for the app and not my entire device."

I kept getting a little popup on my notification screen, no logo, just an empty block. when i tried to swipe it away it stayed there. Upon further investigation (pressing down on the notif for a few seconds) i found out it was from tik tok, i uninstalled the app out of a suspision tik tok could MONITOR what i was viewing/consuming to ""better my content"". No apps, especially one with loads of young people, should have any kind of monitoring."

Everytime I go to change the duration of a text in the new interface and hit save the text ends up being off the screen and there's two copies of it for some reason. I can see that it tried to copy capcut but it needs to be way better."

Secondly, I get none of the new features for weeks. The thing where you hold 2 fingers on the screen for the UI to dissappear is a good example. It did not work for months after it was released. I checked my app store everyday until I got it. And it wasn't my phone, my sister has the same one and she got it way sooner than I did."

Adding voice effects over videos I'm editing? Don't have that feature. When I try to use a sound using multiple videos that I didn't record through the app, I can't edit the amount of time each video clip plays over the sound without using the auto sync.

The clarity of what does and does not violate the rules and regulations for content is questionable. There are certain features are not always available cross all devices.

When creators would put text in the video that was covered up by TikTok's video text, I could long press on the video to bring up a pop up menu so I could see it.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Request TiKToK Wasa great app but there are so many problems with it after a while The not interested button doesn t work because when l press it l get more videos that l don t want to see this also includes live streams l press the button and it gose away but shows making it so l can t follow anyone all these problems make this app nubearable to use and no matter how many times l try to fix it the problem stays My account Shafqat ullah
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It would be nice if tik tok added a couple of more features for those of us who maybe dont want to see anorexic creators and their want to be anorexic fans. That's just one example. Like can we not hide people or the same chat rooms where people are arguing over such important nonsense as how someone styles their hair.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! But I hate it. Everytime we get an update it's always late for me and never shows. It also has changed to I can't edit or keep recording my drafts and only have the option to post them. I still can't do the photo slides like everyone else and I'm tired of waiting. It has been MONTHS! Fix this app. edit: now it's WORSE! Now, when I make a new account, it treats me like a CHILD! FIX THIS! I DON'T NEED A SCREEN TIME! I CAN'T EVEN CHANGE MY PFP! YOU'RE STUPID, TIKTOK! ABSOLUTELY!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tooo damn bright deleting this app soon if we don't get a dark mode and get ride of all the white backgrounds from menues and lists
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"pretty stable app that rarely glitches and works as intended with great algorithm and i can say that every update makes it better by bringing more useful features. i have noticed one issue though, that is the zoom feature. it works fine most of the time but sometimes the app would zoom out by itself and no matter how many times i try zooming in again the app would zoom out. (im using an android smartphone) got over this problem by using screen magnification setting on my phone"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Hi dear when I longing tiktok isn't responding and I cannot post my video on for you page ð¢
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok app absolutely super amazing i ever came across so far,it very fast and easy to use.Tiktok offers great features to all users also to meet but old and new friend around the world."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've started encountering a problem recently where if I try to skip the ad that plays when I open the app, the ad will end as it should, and a video will start playing, but the ""skip ad"" button won't disappear, and tapping literally anything makes the app react like I clicked the ad. I can't do anything when it does this, and I have to close the app to fix it."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The notification and messaging systems were perfect. There should at least be an option because I'm ready to delete the whole app. The update happened like a week ago, went away the same day, and then came back today and it's terrible! Tiktok is not a messaging app! I need to be able to easily access my notifications. If you want a tab up there for messages ig that's OK but making the main page messages doesn't even make sense. It's not even aestetically pleasing."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's fun but I wish there was a feature to have folders in your saves cause I have audios from back in 2016 and even after going back and deleting a bunch I still have to scroll forever and I don't even remember half the audios I saved. And this is bad because I am a cosplayer and I have multiple ideas for multiple of my characters so it's hard to find the right audios most the time. So if I could do folders it would save my life. It could also go for favorited videos too! It would be awesome!!
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since a recent update, the app has been horribly broken. I keep getting age restricted on videos, even tho I have literally never had this feature turned on. I've updated, turned it on then turned it off, done everything I can think of, but it still keeps happening. And ofc there's no support so nothing I can. Honestly about to uninstall the app completely at this point, it's so annoying."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love tik tok. I also am super thrilled about the favorites button being added to videos. The only thing I'd ask for from the app is the ability to easily go see your video history that you've watched. I tend to refresh the page alot and lose a video I wanted to save so having the history tab on your profiles would help prevent that in my opinion.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Left a permanent burn-in image of the upload button on my screen. I will be deleting the app and not downloading again until either 1) tiktok allows for fullscreen, uninterrupted scrolling or 2) tiktok implements OLED safety features in their app (which can be as simple as moving the icons a couple of millimeters every minutes). No entertainment is worth permanent damage to my device."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! It deserves all 5 stars because the content and the design are super good. I'm giving three stars because I and a few of my friends are annoyed at not being able to turn off post notifications for who we follow. It's automatic from what I've seen and the ""turn off"" button doesn't appear to work. If we can have an option for this in the main settings to opt out of post notifications altogether, I'd update this review with 5 stars."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can you add a volume control bar maybe to the top right of the screen so we can adjust the volume of the video on screen instead of the volume buttons on the phone. All of the videos are constantly a different volume and I'm always turning the volume up and down. It would help out a ton! Overall, awesome app though! Great for passing the time."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be good now all the constant lives and adds that show up on the for you page really worsen the experience, wish there was a way to modify this. Also, comments are way too restrictive, meaning you can't comment anything without it 'violating' community guidelines."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bad app It's so little features And the only features there are are annoying ones For example If you follow one of your contacts All of their contacts and their followers show up when they post So now I'm being bombarded with notifications Of my friend's dad posting on TikTok It's so weird Also for like a 2 years People with a Samsung Can't search up stuff
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, except... I installed in October 2018 and my problem started in Febuary 2019. in less then half a year tik tok has taken over my storage space. my phone is DOWNLOADING videos I never even hit the like button on or shared- anything! I am afraid to uninstall other apps that wont work (unrelated) because I dont know if I will have the storage to reinstall. I've tried everything from storage cards to clearing my storage and it isn't enough. Help plz."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad. Plays a video when you load in, even if following a link to a video. ie a video will be playing before loading the video you are going to see. The back button doesn't have uniform use. Hitting it to back out of the app loads another video unlike other apps that let you back out without losing your place. While other screens will back out to, you guessed it, play a video. More bad, clicking a shared link will take you to the wrong video 4 or 5 times before you can get to the shared video."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps glitching I can't even get into it and use it,I have updated it,freed up space and I have stable internet connection and there's still nothing,I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app to use it"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is insanely entertaining, but it's drawing way too much battery.. 2nd only to 13% screen, using 12% of all battery usage today, and I haven't even opened the app for two days! AND I rebooted last night. Please include an option to turn off polling for notifications.. I have them disabled in Android but it still shows an increasing count on the icon, and it's clearly doing something."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is rather useful and fun. There's a lot of filters and ways to make content that make being on tiktok enjoyable. The biggest issue is screen burn. I've always kept my brightness below 50% and somehow have tiktoks buttons burned into my screen. It would be cool to have a setting that has the text disappear or change the colour of the text.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app. I have one problem tough, it doesnt let me make slideshow videos. I want that feature really bad. Change to 5 stars when fixed."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app but now the new update it keeps saying no internet connection to login or logs me out and now it just keeps exiting my screen and going back to the main screening glitching tik Tok please update it for all of us or go back to the old upgrade
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that the features you have on your app for security and privacy don't actually work, You can put as many words as you want into keywords and you'll still get the messages."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying. I hope they fix the problem soon :)"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm no longer able to create my own sounds when I upload videos from my camera roll. It was never a problem before my last ""update"". Update: now I can't even trim the audio inside the camera window you have to trim the audio from the audio list and when you do that and it goes to the camera/ recording window, the buttons don't work. What is going on tiktok?"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently liked videos don't show on My Likes page, and somehow, nobody got a clue on how to fix it. I also hate that there isn't a select all option to delete old videos."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give 5 stars to this great app if it made all the effects available to everyone on tiktok.. Some video effects are only compatible for iPhones. That's not fair to your Android users. I have an LG phone and i can't even make the video i want because the ""green screen"" effect isn't compatible with my device. Disappointing. UPDATE: The update won't work, it won't even let me update."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this app is always buggy. It doesn't even show options for certain things like uploading in high quality on some of my devices but does on others. It has a feature one day and disappears the next. They really need to get some quality control. I try contacting the help desk and they just tell me there isn't an issue or that they just never get back to me."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Missing profile view button and glitchy when trying to make a video
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm facing a problem.It is about My feed there is no nearly users post option in my privacy menu.Fix it I'm still facing problem fix it Still nothing changed.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Way to much censorship that's unevenly applied. It does not adjust the display for different devices, leading to the edges getting cut off. When i tried to suggest a feature (add a other option to the big report page) they was no where to actually put in a suggestion in the ""suggestions"" feature. Good communities, lots of good content. The app its self is garbage. Disabled notifications and i still get them."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok has a hold on funds from your customers, and the funds are how I'll be able to pay my vendors. Thus, making shipping take longer than usual. I dislike that hold feature"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's been good but now it's been glitching. the videos are buffering more than ever. you apparently can't pause on the slideshows anymore?? and before when you could pause on them you had to swipe up to get to the comments and then pause it instead of simply tapping the screen. whenever I press the back button, even when I'm on an account's page, the app somehow resets my fyp. I leave the app for one second and my fyp resets even though I used to be able to leave and come back to the same video."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I pause a video it automatically starts playing again after a few minutes, it's annoying. I pause for a reason, why have the feature if It'll just automatically un pause by itself. I tried reporting the issue on the app itself but all it gave me was ""network error"" when I hit submit, even though my network is perfectly fine and working, guess that's another bug. Overall TikTok keeps doing things by itself, not just un pausing videos."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is good and bad, like too many unwanted commercials/ads, and the biggest thing is hard-core fast battery drain. The positive thing is that you can find great recipes! Suggestions would be to add an advanced search filter feature to find local friends with, like maybe, an option to choose (filter by) Christian or even a sub-filter by denomination. (Example: Non-denominational Christian) or sort by Christian bowling group or soccer."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so when i first got this app, it was Amazing! Indeed alot of funny/Talented Videos! But, there's just 1 tiny bug that I wasn't able to get rid of for months.. So, when i clicked on a video, i wanted to press the little heart (Like button) but then i saw a error come up my screen saying that I wasn't able to like the video, i tried again, but still, the error remained. Please fix it, i really like this app"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"When editing a video it freezes up turns white and then closes the app I spent 2 days trying to get on video ready for posting and everytime I made the content and start adding words it would freeze up, and I couldn't save it to drafts.. another I have ready to post and tiktok won't post it. I've spent this whole week not posting.. because of the app. Other then that the ap is great. I love the variety of options and editing features."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but there's one HUGE issue, the reaction time of the pause button. It seriously takes 3 seconds for the damn thing to react, which doesn't sound like a lot but when you're trying to see something specific, it's huge. This is almost a deal breaker for me, it makes it impossible to enjoy the content without getting extremely frustrated to the point it makes me want to delete the app all together."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this app but recently it has been playing up hugely. I have tried to make the same video about eight times. It keeps saying when I find it in drafts that it has been ""deleted by a third party app"". And now, when I try to save it to drafts, it takes me back to the shooting page and deletes everything I have done."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing . For example when you have press The button to record a video with a sound.on the camera app this has never happened . This has been glitch has been occurring for about 6 month and a half . Some time at work but not often . I headed ever recorde vedio anyway but I do however post edited . So it doesn't really bro my vedio viral and support everyone else â¤ï¸
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The creators are great, but the app itself needs a serious update. Central record button keeps disappearing, versions keep changing but never to the latest, and now it's reset itself back to the original Tik-tok, no background noise remover. Haven't even been updated to the version with the Studio. Really, really bad functionality."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I never get any of the new features updates are supposed to have, and contacting support just gets me nowhere. Apparently they're features intended for beta users, but I used to have some of these features. (Namely the progress bar) They just disappeared randomly. Lives are also glitchy and stutter constantly, though that may just be my internet. It's become very hard to navigate this app when I can't do half the things everyone else can do."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely horrendous. This app has literally the whole globe on it and it also has amazing features. THAT DON'T EVEN WORK! honestly shooting a duet 30 times before it decided that it doesn't want to: Offset the sound Keep crashing Doesn't post, just deletes everything Messes with the volume Absolutely annihilates the quality Completely deletes the audio from the OG video or just the end And many more amazing things to deal with. Its been like this for months. So, 1/5. Absolute headache."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that......... I
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im not sure if I was not stoned at moment of trying to start with this app, but I can assure you. This app have most weird and stupid UI in history. Damn buttons and text cover almost whole screen, and if you try to hide UI by taping on empty space, what is actually meant to work, is unexpectedly pauses the video. Deleted the app to prevent my brain cells to die, cuz they know something about good UI"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"And so I've heard from smart resources that tik tok steals important information from emails, texts, messages, etc. Anything that you put out there in the web, to later sell it or use it for different purposes. Only when downloaded to your phone, though. That's why I use it from the outside. However, they make it really hard for you to open certain pages, almost forcing you to get tired and give up so you can finally download the app to your phone."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Spent a questionable amount of time on the app. Impressive features and content. The short form videos will take emotional toll as you will eventually become ""numb"" and only watch content out of habit. It feels repetitive and unproductive, I believe the infinite scroll makes the personalization of videos poor. Scrolling through 400 videos a day and liking out of habit really ruins the experience. Just limit your time on the app if you have this problem too. This is a design flaw."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fun way to meet new people. The major thing I don't like is when you find a video you like and want to repost from you page and TicTok either takes the video down or they mute the sound track. It doesn't make sense how the video goes against the rules on my page as a REPOST but it's fine to be on the original page!!!! Just does not make sense!!! I had multiple videos treated this way. I might agree with them if it was an original post I made and did something wrong by a REPOST it's not right.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, you can follow people, like them and comment on them. One major problem needs fixing though, I can't access the part where you can add/gain more followers, yet some people have done that already. Another good feature that should be on there is you can follow, block or keep an eye on people without them knowing, but only if it is very important."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, the best social media app in my opinion. While there is one thing that annoys me about it, it's still 5-star worthy. The issue I'm referring to is that sometimes when I follow someone or favorite a video, it won't work. The button will act like it did. Like, after I press follow, the button turns to unfollow, and so on. But when I look at my following list, the account (s) isn't listed, and when I look at my favorites list, the videos don't appear at all. They stay in my liked list tho"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After adding ""collections"" to favorites i was excited to finally be able to sort through all my favs, but there's no way to sort the favorites by oldest to newest; if they could add a button for the option to sort favorites by dates/dates added or something, that would be super user-friendly and fantastic. Otherwise it's really hard and inconvenient to try to sort anything out. Also the ""not interested"" button DOES NOT WORK. I REPEAT, IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Changing to 1â?until it's FIXED."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Due to the new update I can't use the back button anymore. The entire screen spins. I don't know how else to describe it, but it makes the app unuseable."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was usable when I was able to get the algorithm to find videos related to my interests. But since the last few updates the not interested feature doesn't seem to deprioritize videos from creators I'm not interested in and I still get similar things anyway. there has been an increasing number of ads and on top this the app requires a user agreement that is incredibly invasive on your phone. Decided to just uninstall.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, nothing to say, but the problem i have is that I have two accounts and on one of them I can't repost or do any recent features while the other is completely fine."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the latest update pressing two fingers on the screen no longer removes all of the captions etc, other people have mentioned 'clear mode' but that only seems an option for iPhone users. Can this be fixed? It was soo much easier to view the whole tiktok. Also alot of the time the video to audio goes out of sync during the tiktoks, getting worse as the tiktok goes on. I have also noticed it glitching at the begining of the tiktok and re starting after a couple of seconds."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, but constantly have issues getting ahold of support. I have bugs all the time, and no one has gotten back to me about fixing them. I want to make more content with tiktok but it can be really frustrating when I don't have access to certain features or features I've been using (lile text ro speech) don't work suddenly and even updating the app won't bring it back. I'm using a brand new z Flip and had hoped buying a new phone would fix these issues but it didn't."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, but the notifications are a MESS! 1. Live streams notifications is off in settings but I still get them. In the android settings it's categorized under ""other"",but turning it off also turns off the direct messages notifications. 2. Separate notifications in the shade for every single message, instead of one notification saying ""x new messages"". 3. Notifications don't go away even after they're veiwed unless manually dismissed. 4. No feature to reply to a specific DM in chat"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,TicTok is super cool i like it very much you can do everything on it and it has edit features on pictures and sounds and everything.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My screen spins ever time I click a notification or a comment video??? I'd add it on if I could it's actually ridiculous how I can't even enjoy this app properly anymore.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are multiple things wrong with this app.. For starters push notifications are very bad. Second, video format is very bad. Whenever I post a video it is posted with 2 black bars on the sides of the video. Third, the app is nowhere near the same as the ios version. There are so many small and big features that are on ios that aren't on Android."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the concept and the mostly the execution of the apps feature. However I find the messages system most frustrating. There is no way to reply to a particular video if several were sent. Neither can I see who I got a message from or what the text is in the notification. Other then that, a great app."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the first time ever, after months of having the app, TikTok just crashed on me. I was offended but they must be doing something right if it's never crashed before. Endless hours of content. I get sucked in every evening before bed and stay awake 2+ hours more than I wanted to. I do have a suggestion though. Pressing the home button while scrolling thru the for you page instantly refreshes the page. Sometime I accidentally press it, maybe adding a refresh confirmation button when yu press?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App was fine but all of a sudden all my posts are getting 0 views, even when I watch it from another account. It seems like it's not shared on any pages nor subscription pages. This has been happening for 2 weeks and I've deleted and uploaded countless times, even different videos, still nothing. ALL my videos are original content so I know it's not ""being reviewed"""
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As a fellow ex musical.ly user i think the app is well made and stuff. I also really like how your preference adapts to your fyp and it could change anytime, everytime. Although its a good app, i have 2 things that might make it EVEN BETTER. 1st: Fricking add a button where we can see the duets of a video (The people who duetted/stitched that video) 2nd: Once you press ""add to favourites"" we should be able to make like folders thingys to organize our saved videos (favourites) Thats it 4 now ig!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was a 5, but update wrecked editor for Android. The ""studio"" editing suite of features was amazing, but I updated the app and boom it's all gone. Tried several times to reinstall and get the editing features back, but apparently tiktok has been very inconsistent with features rollout. Some people have access (ios users maybe) and others get shafted. It's really inconvenient as a creator to have major features stripped away with no explanation or warning."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"On my new galaxy A03S this app lags so badly it is almost unusable. And the Ai portrait filter is awesome, but the teen filter does nothing. It s not just my face, because this works on my bf's android. I just downloaded a software update and it still has no effect, and gives me no error message or anything, just does not change. There is a slight airbrush on both halves of the screen but nothing more ."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app runs fine, it is fun and I get to enjoy a variety of content, but, and I don't know if I'm the only one this happens to, there are filters that don't work on my device, the app says it, it pulls up a little message, like I can't even open the record page when trying to use certain filters, not that they dont work on me, I am on a Samsung galaxy S21 FE btw Update: they have fixed whatever it was that was going on."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Risky app. This app will slow your phone down. Audio will keep on playing after you close the app. It freezes your phone and makes other features unresponsive. It will not close when you want it to. I am using an android. I also do not like that it starts streaming videos as soon as you open app instead of taking you into a home menu.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"rating 3 stars for the overall performance of the app and my experience. very disappointing to know that ""dark mode"" feature is not supported on androids. would give 4 star rating if it was supported."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app, but music will randomly play over videos on my fyp. I can't get rid of it either, every time I scroll it stays until I close the app and reopen it which is very annoying whenever I'm trying to enjoy content from creators I enjoy. This isn't even addressing the lack of prioritization when it comes to making Android having the same features as iPhone, not to mention the sheer amount of lag that comes with it. I'm genuinely so tired of this."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I browse Tiktok frequently and create content but I have complaints. Tiktok is taking down or removing sounds from videos that are considered ""too harsh"" when other videos with questionable content merely have a content warning. There should be the option to choose if content was for a young audience or not. Whenever I go to the friends section, it glitches and goes black, rendering it useless. Often the save to a collection button is missing, only to reappear later. YouTube has better options."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was 5 star had to change to 4 as I'm still yet to receive the repost feature. Would add the star back if I was contacted but sadly I haven't been. Edit now 3 stars. 3 weeks waiting for a response for my previous issues still no reply. As of the previous update I have been unable to edit my new clips. I have also had multiple features removed when I use nearly all of them. Such as adjustments, templates, the original sound for my clips, the ability to change what part of sound is used. And so on"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best app that you can use it to post your content and engage with your audience. It has advanced features that you can use also to make money.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love using this app, mainly sending videos to friends, and honestly would give it a 4 or greater without hesitation. However, one of the most annoying design changes recently has made me completely flip my stance. The design change in question is the removal of the inbox section of the app, instead placing all your inbox in the main notification section of the app, and replacing the inbox section with a button to start new chats. This button serves no use, I contact people I know more than not"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Idk what happened with the latest update, but now I can't edit my drafts without losing the audio completely. I'm a cosplayer who does transitions and lip syncs to the audio. I can't review changes I make to videos and the ""add audio"" button on the recording screen is grayed out. Please resolve this so I can get back to making content I enjoy. Furthermore, captions are missing on all videos. What happened?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some features are missing for some people. It's very unfair that I can not see the layout option for the duets in order to make it horizontal. I don't have that button. And I see many horizontal deuts however they are only made with people who have tons of followers and likes. That's disappointing and it feels very wrong for them to do this. I uninstalled and re-installed to make sure it was up to date and STILL no layout option for the duets. Also, some peoples Instagram links are not working."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to work great but suddenly most of my effects and ""try this effect button"" on others videos have disappeared. I only have a handful of effects and most are Xmas and New Years. I've asked 3 times for help on the app and all they do is say ""Thank you for the feedback"". It has been months, now I just view toks and not make them :("
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Enjoy the app, but it is missing some of the features from the IPhone version. Once you follow someone their content basically disappears for ever"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the creators and content but the app itself needs an update. No notifications (yes, I've checked the settings) and when I do receive a notification it's a random page I don't even follow or a video that's months old. The amount of lives I've missed because there was no notification is a joke! Clear mode was a joke, it was there for about 5 videos then suddenly disappeared again and now there's random pop-ups. Also the random friend suggestions, you're not Facebook, leave it alone."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New bug where two videos play at once, the background one can't be paused, and I have to restart the app. For a global company so widely used, who's harvested the data of nearly every American in the country, I find it hard to believe you guys can't make a decent app that works more often than not. There's always something new wrong, your new features suck, and the app just isn't good. I would never touch TikTok if not for family and friends sending me videos on it. Absolutely horrible."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but something weird is happening on my phone I can see the tiktok bottom buttons that are usually at the bottom of the screen, the plus, home, etc, I see them constantly faintly in the background of every app, its weird and creepy and I'm really debating on deleting the app. I do not know how to fix this but it's uncomfortable and I turned off permission to run in background and it's still there....I don't want to but I might have to delete it..."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and the content but I can't tell you how many times I've tried to put a tiktok in my favorites so I can remember to follow up on a series and have accidentally hit ""not interested"". I mess up my algorithm and there seems to be no way to undo that. There should either be an undo button after an action like that or a second box after you hit not interested that lets you confirm so people have a chance to fix it! It really throws off my experience."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have posted videos more than 1K. Most of the videos are in good clarity but that doesn't go viral and will not get likes for that. If a girl jumps or do anything with bad videos, that will go viral not the one's videos who used to work hard to achieve it. So many bugs are still there..the slow motion is also not good in this ..wish you could look over it soon...and try to add slow motion feature like in btwn 3 to 4 places in the TIKTOK video...not only in one place."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One step forward and two steps back. What happened to the watch history option. You press a button by mistake and will never get back to a video you missed again. Cannot read captions. There was a brief update where the caption was visible in the comment section. Bring it back! I would like to save some videos, but I do not want them in my camera folder. Most apps have their own download folders."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Still hard to figure out all the features and also being able to get views. Sometimes my videos get alot other times hardly any..
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They tanked the state-of-the art algorythem to censor Pali stinian voices and gave cencorship control to fascist governments. Every other video is an insufferable add. Each update cheapens the experience. Notably the back function reloads the fyp so it's no longer possible to see what you were just looking at. Most of the videos are not saved on the watch history tab which makes it impossible to find anything prevalent or maintain a cohesive narrative. Disappointed not surprised 0/5 do better.
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They have that effect called raindrop control where you would move your hand and big bubbles would appear in the video and now it doesn't work anymore. I don't know if it doesn't work because of an update but you need to bring that feature back ASAP. Because it wasn't working I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I lost over 70 drafts that I had saved which took me hours to make. Could please return my drafts and fix the effect button I would really appreciate it thanks
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"entertaining, good for contacting and findings new friends... however the direct messaging system has a few flaws, these being that there is a selection of words which cannot be used, but this is not disclosed to users... and when these words are used, it well not send any of the message typed And there is no way to remove this feature, nor urea there any confirmation of it in the settings, or by the staff... this has plagued me since an update about 4-5 months ago... unable to send photos though"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have the latest Samsung phone, latest android os, and latest snapdragon, yet features on tiktok keep disappearing. I can no longer see the sounds ppl are using. That's a great feature for helping me to search for different creators and now I cannot do that. I also do not have access to certain basic features when creating my own tiktoks, like text-to-speech, which I was able to use on older phones with older OS. Please update with the technology."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I advise you to save the most current videos we've watched. Since it's challenging to locate the video and pick up where we left off if we accidently touch the back button or any other button in the middle of the video. Please take this into consideration as a significant issue for numerous users. Thanks
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The reach is impressive. The personal version is great having with new music to create. Business features lack that feature but understandable, not sure if there is or will eventually be a package for use of Copyright music ? (specifically for artists creative usage) not for ads. Great experience. Variety of live feed is definitely your distinguishing feature."

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been having issues with being selectively given strikes on your app. For posting the same trends I have seen wide across your app for weeks. Every time I try to report an issue it shows me network error. And it is not because I have a network error, that only pops up when I try to hit the send button. I see other videos just fine and i post fine. I have tried for 3 days to send reports, as if tictok does not want to hear from me. Pathetic that they wont listen to their own users honestly."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It seems like every update makes this worse for android (specifically miui) users. At first I turned on the setting that gives me message previews in my notifications. A couple days later this is gone. Doesn't even tell me who a message came from anymore. Now a ""shiny new update"" moves the button to send a video to a friend all the way to the back of the list of sharing options... It's almost like this is all being done on purpose. EDIT: now there's also whitespace at the bottom of DM chats"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice content very buggy app. For example half the time clicking on creator icon just shows blank screen. Switching by swiping right automatically plays wrong audio (it's the same as video you were on, so you get new video and wrong audio). It's a mess. P.s. problems still persist. 100500 steps required to actually report them are not helping. Seriously add a freaking text field to ""describe a problem"" instead of 5 levels of menus and NOT being able to report the bug in the end. Horrible UX"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but few things I personally would love to see: A feature to create playlist(s) for every videos, not just for mine only; a feature to remove all unavailable videos in ""Favorites"" at once; A feature to sort out all my Favorite vids by day added/posted/etc. OR custom (could add this feature in the playlist feature instead); an update where the search filters ACTUALLY work right; dark mode option for Androids; a filter to sort videos in a tag based on date posted, views, popularity, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like the app, but features not there. The current trend is the voice changer, but I can't get it no matter how hard I try. I update, I uninstall and reinstall. This happens with literally every trend feature within this app - I never get them. Why? Is it because I have Android? It makes me not want to create videos, despite having over 4000 followers, because i can never follow the trends and can't create good content without the features. I wish features were consistent across all phones."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The concept is great but the actual app is just straight-up bad. When it actually decides to run, the first couple of videos are always a slideshow until the app catches up with itself. Half the features don't work even when it does actually manage to play 3 videos in a row without freezing (shout out to the watch and comment history which have never worked and have only ever instantly crashed the app). So yeah, great idea, you just need monk-like patience or a super computer to use the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Truly a terrible app. So predatory and manipulative. Keeps playing videos when you're pressing the back button to try to close it also uses a ton of data in the background. I pay by the gigabyte and this month's cell phone bill is going to be really high cuz I did not notice it was just using my data without my expressed permission. I've hardly used the app at all what it is doing in the background that is so data hungry is a mystery.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use the ""not interested"" feature every time I open tiktok, and it still recommends the same irrelevant content and creators. I make sure to go to details and specify if it is a sound I don't want recommended or a creator, but it doesn't matter. Every day, same people, same sounds, and no end in sight. I have submitted a ticket in the app with screenshots, but there was no response from CSR. If I like one video by someone, my fyp is their entire channel. It makes me want to barf!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My following page is gone. Whenever I want it back so I can see the content creators I actually like, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app so I can view it the first time- as soon as I close the app it's gone. Plus, just now, there was a bug that wouldn't even open the app, AND the app harassed you to connect your FB, contacts, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sad to give this app 2 stars but omg there's a lot of problems right now. First of all, where's the dark mode? It's legitimately 2023 and there's no dark mode. Also, what happened to the scroll bar at the bottom of the screen used to rewind or fast forward videos. Nobody ever complained about that feature and considering how bad TikTok's ui is, a single accidental swipe in any direction could mean having to rewatch potentially minutes of a video just to get back to the part you left off on."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has been getting more and more ridiculous. The constant horrible live videos, the ads made to look like other videos, the weird follow page that you can't skip, and now they've removed the watch History option? If you're going to randomly reset so I lose my place after leaving for only a minute, you have to bring back that watch History option or I'm going to have to stop going on to the app. Also I don't want to connect to my irls on here so stop asking."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm for your ""foryou"" page is easily thrown off when your friends send you videos, and the ""community standards"" are completely one sided. I posted a video which contained a short clip of my husband at a private outdoor shooting range, along with many other short clips, and it was removed for ""violating community standards"". I'm no longer contributing to this nonsense."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the new notification screen. Edit: the app repeatedly crashes at least 2-3 times a day. Edit 2: I hate Taylor Swift. I hate her genre of music. Every single video that is related to Swift, I hit not interested. And yet the algorithm keeps showing her. Makes me think Swift pays you guys to boost her popularity on the algorithm."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is the app always bugging until i go to the Play Store to manually update it?!? It's annoying. In the last few days, when i open the app, after few fast scrolls, it freezes the whole screen with the sound blasting, until i scroll away and close it. With few other minor bugs, i always have to check the Play Store for updates and then the same thing happens sometime later. It's absurd and... not great. At all."

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My Request I love this App. It's the best experience ever. However I have a proposal. Because the way tiktok is made it burns into our screen. Can you allow us to click the video and then the + and for you and following disappear off the screen. It can show then you touch the video and the menu could go away to prevent screen burn in.

Disappointing as i had found a lot of great posting that i find inspiring, yet one day i tried logging in and account disappeared and after creating new account, the search bar no longer appears. I tried un installing and reinstalling twice and doesn't work. April 2023 update, problem fixed.. Access ok. I like the motivational pages and Christian pages also...Uplifting ( upgraded to 5 *)"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hate the new update. The slides suck and you some how made them even worse by making me tap 2x to pause the music. Especially since the first tap reorients the screen and brings up the comments, then you have to tap again, in a different spot, to pause the music. Also the slide scrolls so quickly you can barely look at it. I just skip the slides now, which sucks cause they were a bearable addition before and now they are just infuriating. New slide update is clunky and unnecessary."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love the app. My only problem is that after the recent update tiktok has been glitchy. Videos are lagging and I have to scroll up and down to get the video to play properly. After I leave a comment the keyboard opens up and closes multiple times unless I exit the comment section and go back in and sometimes a video will be playing fine but the moment I like the video it freezes or lags and the audio continues. I've never had these issues before and since I updated the app its been doing this
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really used to love this app but it is so buggy now that it makes it no fun to use. NONE of the effects work on my phone. I have the Galaxy Z Flip 3 so it doesn't make sense why I lost my effects but my S10+ didn't have any issues. I also can't edit sounds or even use text on my videos anymore. Watching tiktoks is one thing but being able to make videos with all of the features is what pulled me into the app in the first place. This has to be fixed before I try to use it again. Very sad.
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. I come Errors accur while using the app. For the example when you press the button to record. Video with soundsð when the sound plays. The camera is only site never been like this. This the error is happening for about 1 mouth. And a half. Some time it's works but not often.

2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"every month or so, id have to uninstall tiktok because whenever id press on the app, the tiktok logo would come up, and then id be back on my home screen. And that would happen to the point where i was clicking on the app, and nothing was happening. And yes i have gone onto the playstore to see if i just needed to update the app, but nope, it just said open, which i did try but again it didn't work. I think this bug is ridiculous. I want it fixed and i want it fixed soon."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My phone is always hanging each time I open the app which is so frustrating. If only TikTok lite possessed all the features of TikTok I would have switched over to it. Live videos are nothing to write home about,it will always hang. At first I thought it was network issues but it never changed. From time to time it says,'Tiktok is not responding,(close app,wait,send feedback)'. It's quite frustrating and I keep wondering if other people experience this or is the problem from my phone."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can't record my own voice after choosing a sound. Tiktok had temporarily fixed this issue by allowing us to turn the mic on or off, and setting the volume for each. Even though I turned automatic updates OFF, TikTok still removed this feature, which makes it more difficult to sync my speech with the sound. This also impacts duets. BRING IT BACK! I removed a star because of this issue. UPDATE: I have submitted THREE tickets as of 11/16/20 (Aug., Oct., Nov.)"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I was thinking that it was maybe my phone or my wifi connection because I have exactly been experiencing the same issues or bugs and crashing without even opening the app itself, sometime it will just be on the TikTok page indefinitely without opening the app. I have tried restarting my phone couples of time but still does the same. Reading the reviews below, I noticed that I'm not the only one. What happening with tik tok??? Developers are you taking tik tok off the media? Let us know at least"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound .the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited . And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that........ ali
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I go live a few times a week and I use the green screen filter like most people do during their live sessions. But as of last month mine are gone. I've reported the issue several times and nothing has been fixed. I have literally tried everything to remedy this issue and nothing has worked. I was hoping with this new update I would have seen the effects icon back where it should be but still nothing. I like using this feature and would like to be able to continue to have access to green screen.

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine, it functions normally, but the fact that feature accessibility is not consistent across all versions of the platform is driving me nuts. It took i believe 6+ months post release for my app to get the option for captions and i am still currently waiting on the playlist feature. I get it, multiple operating systems requires different coding, but you have to draw the line somewhere."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I spend too much time on this app, and I've noticed that they removed the slideshow feature for some tiktok creators, myself included. It's very frustrating, especially since sometimes I just want to create a slideshow that other people swipe through. It's completely unfair, and then tiktok has a tendency to gatekeeper features from creators until they're 'popular' or 'trending'. The algorithm is great, but there's no incentive for me to create and share, which is a big part of Muhammad naseer"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Won't let me see some of my drafts, says ""some drafts may not work with this version of tik tok"" but yet theres no newer versions for me to update to? too be able to see my drafts. Honestly so stupid, also all the small changes, like friends being able to see what you repost on your page, and other bits and pieces that you don't really notice at first till you go to do something and it's different. Not gonna lie tik tok keeps making updates that makes the app less enjoyable. Still love the app:)"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: still no effects. Tried every tutorial, trick, everything. So disappointing. Just updated. Still no new voice effects. Do better tik tok. Updates and features are consistently EXTREMELY behind for Android. New features are often available months after iPhone users and the app itself is discriminatory toward Android, though most apps do. I am uses to this for most apps and for upload quality ect, I don't really care. I really just wish we got the new features when everyone else does."

Sometimes my comments or likes aren't visible to other users.

2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is good, but there definitely needs to be an option to hide captions. It makes it nearly impossible to read things creators out at the bottom of the screen. I used to long press on the screen so a menu would pop up and I could read whatever is on the screen but now the menu comes from the bottom and is useless to me. It's so frustrating."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I feel like Tiktok should get a view just watched option where you are able to watch a video and go to that person's profile and have an option to find the video you've just watched and it's part 2 or so. Would make it so much more convenient than having to scroll through hundreds of videos. Thank you tiktok for adding the just watched button
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app! One thing that I'm not happy about is the audio sync with duets. I absolutely love the duet feature so u can add harmonies onto friends singing videos, but I have to work some type of magic to get the audio to sync up. I always make sure my phone is optimised before recording, but it doesn't sync up. Other times I have to uninstall/reinstall or even restart my phone to align the audio. Could there be a way to manually sync audio?"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be rated much higher if not for the fact that for some reason my app is like 100 updates behind? I don't have the story, repost, or tag feature, and the app itself just looks and runs like its outdated. The only way to fix this issue is to reinstall the app entirely, which is obviously enormously inconveniencing. However this doesn't make the app unusable and otherwise tiktok is great."

Now I have to edit my clips first then go to a separate section to pick my sound. Can't do both while in default mode.

I often fall asleep watching tiktok but so far, if I manage to pause the video before sleeping the screen would turn off. The last few nights I woke up to an empty battery because it was still on. The screen should turn off when paused and after a video was played 5 times in a row. Anything else doesn't make sense..."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The report system is broken, the community guidelines are way too strict for this to be considered a 13+ app, I cannot type tags without having to go back 10 times minimum, when I go to edit my text the text box will move to the corner of the screen making it inaccessible and unable to delete, and the layout makes navigating the app extremely difficult.

I'm left handed and I constantly accidentally refresh my tik tok almost every video, if you change the the refresh button to the (For you) spot right next to (Following) it would be way more efficient in my mind.

2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The bugs in this app are a lottt I can't see filters I can't search filters I don't have a lot of features like other people and my phone is not old so it's not the phone or the version of it
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying. hope they fix the problem soon :)"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't want to sit here and be another complaint because I truly love this app and it's amazing,creative videos! I do however NOT LIKE that I cannot follow a page! I can't add new pages at all! I've re-download 3x with no fixing the issue! It's a real bummerð hoping maybe someone or tik tok can help me resolve this issue! I really like this app and hope I can continue to use it and follow new people!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so dumb. The one and only video i posted got taken down for one reason or another, who really knows why. If i can't post what i want on my page, I'll gladly delete my account and tell everyone i know to do the same.. also i tried to delete my account and the app wouldn't let me so... (That's not creepy at all)"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Honestly it's a good app. The best features in tiktok template.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I keep hitting the Not Interested button. But the app brings the same video/creator up again no matter how many times I select the option for it not to.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's good and all, but I have a problem with reposting? I don't seem to find the repost button anywhere, nor do i know if it's available for my phone. I haven't seen the feature for a while."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it, use it everyday. Good entertainment in short bursts and the new features they add don't break the app like others ð¤£ reliable and fun to use"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So while this app has been letting me post content and with every page has a certain topic they would post under. And recently I've had both my meme/junk accounts banned due to unclear violations of the community guidelines, I still do not understand what I did, however of you're just a small content creator, and you post what you love, I do not recommend this app if you're trying just to have fun and share what you love doing."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app,there is a variety of videos you can watch..what I like about this app is that anyone could go viral and your comments don't get disabled unlike in youtube..there are no copyrights so it's less stressful when u post..tiktok also has some secret features like u can do special emojis in the comment section..the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is bc you cannot post long comments.also u can refresh ur fyp,message ur friends/make new friends so it's a good app overall."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every feature is best but Favorite song list is not show in this app ð¥º
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the recent updates took the search bar from the ""followers"" tab. Please give it back! Ideally it would allow you to sort friends/ following, but at least give the search bar back!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok but being that I'm unable to use certain features & functions in-app such as certain filters because my phone isn't compatible after the update. My phone & the app is up to date. TikTok is the only app I have a problem with that doesn't let me use certain filters. Babyyyyyy, TikTok ain't finna play with my feelings and my pockets ð¤£ got me out here thinking ð¤ð¬ ""Does do that with an iPhone?"". I think the think NOT! Discrimination against my SAMSUNG I tell you ð¤£ðððð"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Um can we please have the search back in our following section? Like I don't want to scroll to find the people you decided to ban without removing them from my list. Also would appreciate it if I could have sound back in my videos. You update and refuse my ability to make a video because I can't have sound. Do better!
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app for its entertaining purposes, but it needs some extra features. For example to be able to edit comments, to be able to message someone if they dont follow you back. And something more important: looking for a specific video in someone else's profile is a PAIN. Maybe searching by keywords would help, or adding something like categories. Just a suggestion, but overall the app effectively kills boredom."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The for you page is sometimes sketchy and sometimes there is sus stuff on there but it is a good download
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"can you add a ""ignore all reposts"" button on someone's profile? I've seen nothing but my mutual reposts forever and it's starting to annoy me"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hard to describe how bad the user experience is on this app. I can't even see my following page half the time cuz it just recommends random garbage I don't care about instead.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Overall this app is fine but what disturbs me is the reporting system, I have reported so many times instances of rape jokes and people making fun of women and saying that is all they are good for and every single time I have, tiktoks finds 'no violation'. It's actually ridiculous how this app has so much hate on it but literally has a report button for every minor thing. It's like it's there just for show."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love tiktok so much but I been having trouble with the story feature it only let's me post on it at certen times i don't know if u made it like this or if it's just a bug but yeah just thoght I should address this just in case
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,(android users) it keeps refreshing there no way to stop it from refreshing... (I think) could they add a button for the homesge to stop refreshing if one does not wish it to refresh? please...
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the love of creation of all things, please add shuffle feature for liked videos so we can watch our liked videos randomly please!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The best feature of titok that I like to use template to edit video.Because of this feature we edit our videos in just on click.
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun app,but I hate when I accidently click refresh on the page and I can never find the video I refreshed on."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What's wrong with you why you don't opened the beta program or live or monotrized in Pakistan why don't work these feature why .. so plz release the these features in Pakistan otherwise we have to go for uninstall the tik tok oky . This is last one week warn of you
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dissapointed with the ui on android. Some elements follow the system theme while others are always on light theme. Dark mode is an essential feature that needs to be added
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Started in 2019. I've Always liked tiktok but I still never get any new features like slideshows and other stuff but other than that love it
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I keep hitting ""Not interested"" on specific notifications but it keeps reccomending them. How many times do I have to press that button?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't save my video without water mark neither can I do the photo swipe most people are doing the features just come and go and this is an hidrance to my content creating
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the wide variety of content on this app, keeps me very entertained. Lately though, when I try to view creator pages all I see is white, which is very frustrating. This glitch needs to be fixed because it's totally unfair to the creators that multiple viewers are unable to go back and see their content. There have been multiple pages I wanted to go back to to follow a story but couldn't. Please fix this, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this problem."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New effects for opening or closing any page/profile pic/settings.. are broken and glitchy. Just get rid of them..
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app as it's fun and entertaining but it's not really fun to see my videos flop, so when I try to promote it the option isn't even there. I know me flopping has nothing to do with tiktok but please add the button back, also please fix your slideshows. when I use it it's very bad quality or when I add just a picture in general, please fix it!!!!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App used to be enjoyable, but recently there has been a huge increase in spam accounts. The ""not interested"" button doesn't seem to function at all. And there is zero way to block a tiktok Audio or specific filters so instead of seeing actual videos my entire feed is the exact same videos on Loop all posted by different accounts. No matter how much I interact with videos I actually want to see my whole feed is flooded with the exact same song. I have to block hundreds of accounts because this"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the app updated its been a mess. Constantly glitches and says it's not connected to the network (forgot the actual verbiage it uses when it says it's not connected). THE worst part is when I share a tiktok with someone, I have to scroll back and forth between tiktoks to make the share menu go away and the share menu freezes in place making it frustrating and impossible to share videos with people. I've put in two help desk tickets and have had zero resolution and it's been weeks."
