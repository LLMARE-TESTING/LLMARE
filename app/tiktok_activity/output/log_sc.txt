I love the app! I'm looking forward to creating more on there! I don't like that the app can get slow when editing or posting a video. For instance today I picked out the cover of my video and it totally didn't set. Now my video has a weird cover. It's happened to me multiple times. I think there should be an edit feature for that specific default. Even for editing the caption! There could be a lot of great fixes! Please listen to your users!

Galaxy Fold problem me and my husband have a galaxy. Fold4, and both of them are having problems with TikTok. The screen will load half of the screen and the other side be black. Also, the comments are always off , With this new update, please fix this now. I know our phones are new so it has nothing to do it .

Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse.

The TikTok experience has become increasingly frustrating. I deleted and reinstalled the app hoping to fix the editing issue, only to encounter more problems?no 2x feature, still unable to edit, and reposting is no longer possible. It's disappointing for both viewers and creators. Please address these issues. I can't believe I risked all my drafts for a complete downgrade.

great app honestly, it's really fun to watch and make videos. I do have an issue though - in videos where there's CLEARLY an effect being used it doesn't display the little button that has the effect name on it if yk what I mean, then when I try to search for the effect it isn't there. if this is because of the device I have then it's stupid as hell because I have a brand new samsung phone. please fix this issue and also make dark mode available to samsung users.

Honestly I like watching tiktok and the videos are so cool, but there are tons of complaints. First of all I can't fund my REPOST BUTTON. This is very annoying also I can't even send messages on tiktok even though u did nothing, I can't even find the msg button also. Plz I'm to check this out... I'm very upset at this point.. like what's the use of using tiktok . One more thing I don't have the button to like... select emojis... there are only 5 emojis I'm using.. tysm

This app is okay and all, but an bug i recently encountered is that whenever i press and hold the screen to bring up the menu to add the video to favorites and others doesn't appear. Once that happens I can't exit out of it, neither does switching to "following" or "for you" fixes the issue I have to close the app and open it back up. I'm not sure if anyone else encountered this issue but please fix it in the next update.
