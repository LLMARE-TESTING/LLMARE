"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"reels are uncomfortable because you can't properly skip videos back or ahead. also stories frequently don't get saved in archive at all, or randomly (for example, out of 4 stories made in one day, only one or two will be saved, and the rest won't appear in archive, even after a few days). often half of the stories in the archive won't load at all, even with perfect connection. also sometimes highlights don't work properly: the story you have added won't appear, even after several attempts."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really didn't mind it at first but now it's really ticking me off. When I try to change the layout of my instagram story, I get sent to a black screen in which my photos disappear. Even with uninstalling the app, restarting my device, clearing the cache, I'm still unable to fix the issue. Hopefully the instagram management can get back to this and resolve the bug immediately."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app. A very good way to keep a Digital Album of the memories that you have created with your homies‚ù§. Just a small feedback. Instagram should allow to delete a particular slide(picture) from a post of 10 pictures. Because life is very unpredictable. Some event happens, after which, you don't want to keep the people in a particular photo on your profile, but you don't want to delete other pictures in the same post. Why deleting other memories only because of one bad memory?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is great, but not for business accounts. The problems I have are that I cannot schedule posts through my phone. I can only schedule posts through my tablet. Also, boosting barely works. I reach maybe two more people than usual when I boost when the promise is up to 100. The other problem is the algorithm. If you are an up-and-coming artist, it's extremely hard to gain traction and have it stick. Other than that, it's a good app if you're not using it as a business account."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unable to scroll through a story without it freezing solid. It randomly crashes at time where it's never been opened so how's it running in the background? The reels when clicking on one are extremely repetitive instead of loading new things. Fix your app. Now. Was flagged for unfollowing a bunch of people at one time (expected). 3 days later, I get told I apparently used something to get likes/follows and now I'm completely limited and can do nothing until 2024-04-08. FIX YOUR USELESS SYSTEM."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Logging out of this app is unnecessarily difficult. You click on the menu button, but then the drop-down menu doesn't appear immediately. You literally need to click away and then click back for it to FINALLY appear. I understand that you're trying to be innovative. However, your innovation is inconvenient. Just keep it user-friendly."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I guess the app updated at some point, because now I can no longer view any saved or like posts/reels that I've seen. Years of posts from friends and family or reels that I found to be enjoyable are just gone. No clear answer or solution to fix this issue. There used to be an option that said recent activity that showed these, but that option is gone."

If the audio of the reel is off, i tap on it to unmute but instead of unmuting it pauses the video. Now again if the reel is playing with full volume, but when i want to mute the audio i tap on it, instead of muting the reel pauses. New feature lets you pause/play by tapping, but how to mute/unmite the video? L 2. Your Meta AI gives absurd and bizzare information, its untrue , like rumours. üëΩ Tech people fix this"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Instagram and think it has some great qualities. However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would love it however, whenever I add a new photo to the previous images that I want to post, it bugs out and all my progress(including the previous photos) are lost. You can understand how infuriating this can be when I spent ages picking and editing each photo. Moreover, I'm unable to pause the reels, I can only do it by long holding the screen. Finally, when I'm posting with music, the song stutters or glitches. It becomes very annoying after a while and other people have the same issue"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Stories and highlights used to be working just fine. Now some of the stories won't show up in my archive. Sometimes, some of the stories I tried adding to my highlights won't show up either, even if I've tried multiple times. Updating doesn't work. I've had to reinstall repeatedly. This app is already good, but I hope this gets fixed as this is inconvenient. Edited to 2 stars. When I try to log into another account, app says it's non-existent when it isn't."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Making reels is so painful. The app crashes so many times and all the work gets lost. Sometimes I will spent 20-30 minutes creating a reel out of 10 or so videos which is perfectly timed to the music, and then the app will either crash and I have to start again. Or I will post it, and the music will be out of sync etc. It's incredibly frustrating, and I get it, it's just an app, but if you have like 2bn+ people using your app, it should be perfect."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is mostly fine. I can't believe that reels, which is basically rebranded Instagram TV or whatever it was called, is still so glitchy. I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck. Have to restart the app. The time slider doesn't work or disappears half the time. And every time I open a suggested reel, it tells me I can scroll to see more. Like as though I don't know that by now. Also, where is the opt back in to political suggested posts? Does it even exist? Or are you lying?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! ü§¶
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a great app. It is very user friendly and entertaining. But nowadays, I'm facing a lot of issues with the app. Whenever I reinstall the app, I am getting an outdated version of the app, and it's taking a lot of time to get updated. Even after getting the update, I am unable to use the layout option for stories. It keeps glitching. Really disappointed with the app lately. Requesting meta and Instagram to fix this bug ASAP."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pausing reels is inconsistent. One week I tap the screen and it pauses the next the same action mutes the video. Pausing should be intuitive. (especially if pausing is needed to prevent autoscrolling) There is no option to disable autoscrolling on reels as of right now. I don't want this feature. I don't like it. I want to stop it. It's not useful and it happens at the worst times.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like instagram, but this app has a lot of issues lately. Ever since updating the app a couple of weeks ago, I can no longer add my own posts to my story. The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3.5 stars. Purpose of the app is fun and easy to use but there is no consistency in the UI. I don't know why the developers keep changing it. Contacts changing back and forth between lists and bubbles, rearranging contacts, adding favourites that aren't at the top of your search, tap to pause, then tap to mute, then back to pause. Just stick with one UI please"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Instagram! It's my go-to platform for connecting with friends, staying updated on trends, and exploring new content. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, and the variety of features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV keeps things interesting. Plus, the algorithm seems to know exactly what I'm interested in, so my feed is always filled with relevant and engaging posts. Overall, Instagram gets a solid 5-star rating from me!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Painful to upload pictures. Sometimes when carefully selecting and editing your pictures for a post to the feed, the app just crashes and you're left empty handed. When using square frames, IG tends to screw this up and on one side of the picture, there is an ugly white bar. Sometimes on the story when you use a location, the font is below the icon which makes it look ugly. Sometimes when you post the story, the picture stays on the screen after so you have to reopen."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Am having an issue with your app. Whenever something is being uploaded on my story it takes forever as if that's not enough. Even when it's done loading I can't switch to my second account. And my second account is my business account it's very important to me. Then I can't even read messages in my DMs. I see them in the notifications and when I open the app to reply. They don't appear. It's almost impossible to get a song using your app. I have to get from other apps then post.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has become so poor I'm so close to leaving it completely. Tagging people resets the post. Adding photos to a draft resets the post. Selecting multiple photos for a post doesn't work half the time. Basic functions have become broken to the point that I don't have time to deal with the multiple attempts and this is coming from a full time creator. Going to just focus on my YouTube content now, I'll post here when I have time to waste and a high bandwidth for frustration."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This new update is not cool at all. When someone sends me a reel and I want to keep scrolling and see something new, it just keeps recycling the same reels in the chat. And you can refresh the reels because it keeps going up the list of reels already in the chat. Also, on android, when you would tap the screen, it would pause the video, amazing! That has been removed for some reason. Grrrr"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The android version has always been so buggy, and it only gets worse over time. Key aspects that should work do not and it makes it hard to be able to use the app at all. Photo cropping does not work and resets any edits you've made constantly. The pin to profile/unpin doesn't function properly. If you open a link in someone's bio in dark mode, it immediately bugs out the whole UI when you return from the link... the list goes on."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very annoying auto-refresh often takes me away from the item I'm looking at, or the one I'm about to look at, before I'm finished, and this makes me rage close the app. Content is good because you choose what you want follow, IG is just the platform. And how can images be zoomed in on, apart from the momentary finger zoom that reverts when the fingers are taken off?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so glitchy when it comes to posting story or on feed. It use to work fine but for the past 3 months it's a hassle to post anything. I've officially stopped even trying to post stories or anything since the app crashes or the screen goes black everytime I try to post it. When I try to post 1+ pics, the layout can't be changed, I can't search for more filters. When I try to post on feed, the order and edit and filters don't work. Fix the issues. It's genuinely irritating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some bugs just piss me off...it's not that they don't get fixed after someday but in every update there's a new issue and hey for sure I love this app and never has a thought crossed my mind to deactivate my account...I have been using this platform ever since I got my first smartphone (6 years ago) and it has gone through its ups and downs. I am leaving a 4-star rating because after the lockdown started Instagram changed dramatically and is still making changes. Thanks, Instagram forever more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great when it works. I often have to wait a long time for updates to actually get to my phone. With having different accounts, the update will only be on one account and not the others. Sometimes when I redownload the app, the update is completely gone. I've had to move accounts consistently because the app would be on an older version ONLY for that account. It's frustrating. If I'm on the app too long it'll break and I'll need to reopen it. Other than that, it works as intended."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I only really use insta to message my friends. I keep having this issue where I can't see what they've sent, and it'll either permanently say they're typing, or, I have to go off of the app, and view their message as a notification. It's incredibly annoying and I struggle to message them. I don't know what's wrong with the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixes it for a few days, but then it goes back to the way it was, not letting me see their messages."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The feed is in no apparent order, which is annoying. Stories disappear after 24 hours, which is too short. Also, using your fingers to enlarge a picture for a story often makes the picture tilt to one side, making a mess. Accidentally touching the top of the screen causes the feed to scroll all the way to the top, which is STUPID. Why does a blank space act as a button? Also, the ""use the app"" button in Chrome opens the app to the feed instead of the user's profile."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is okay. At best. 1) Algorithms are trash. Starts on a random feed you likely haven't seen yet, just before refreshing itself to show you a whole new recycled feed. 2) Photo sharing consistently degrades quality. 3) Pausing videos is buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Goes hand in hand with: 4) The NEW problem of not being able to go forward or back on a video while it's playing. If this wasn't an accidental bug, you should probably reconsider. Please fix?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sick of ""Your edits weren't saved, please try again"" error messages. Considering it is a photo app, the options for photo sizes appear to be limited. In order to zoom, you have to hold your fingers on the screen, which blocks the photo you are trying to see, soon as you let go, the photo zooms back out to normal size. No option to rotate phone into landscape orientation in order to view landscape/16:9 photos better. Just not a very well put together photo app. Huge disappointment."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Starting a few versions back, I'm not able to reproduce reels sent by Whatsapp or any other app. When I click on the link, Instagram opens up in the reels but in black screen and video is never reproduced. Please note that I'm able to open the link to post, this issue only happens with reels. UPDATE: A few weeks back the issue was solved."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Engagement on Instagram has fallen so hard over the years. They want you to upload reels in order to be seen, but when you try to upload a reel it doesn't work, either it posts to drafts instead of public, or the text you placed dissapears, or the music you added goes to 100% volume despite turning it down. If you want us to use specific features on your app, maybe make them functional? Then there's the issue of thousands of spam/bot accounts that comment on all of the photos you post. Over it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been using instagram since last year and the features are just great i like the way that you can highlight your stories and etc. i also like the way that you can add music to your posts to add a little more detail . But the only problem is if you log in your account in multiple devices it gives you like an error that you can't log in in other more devices. But overall still my favorite social media app in communicating with friends and family.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads (I'm sure everyone agrees with this!), too much unwanted content and wildly inconsistent between accounts! Two separate personal accounts I can see (mine and someone else's), and the layout is different on each one! We need to be able to ONLY see the accounts we follow as a default, and when an ad is hidden, selecting not to see an ad from them again should work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"All in all, this is a poor platform for content creation and sharing. The app deletes content drafts before posting and gives no way to restore lost content when the software fails to post. I switched to a different editing software because of the constant failures. No organic reach available, most followers do not see my posts despite >20% engagement rate."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of my stories in my archive aren't there anymore. They just disappeared. Some of the stories in my archives, I also put in my highlights. They're not in my highlights, either. I don't know what bug this is but random stories from both my archive and highlights have been disappearing randomly. Please fix this. Edit (Apr. 2, 2024): Same problem. My recent stories that happen to be my favorites are GONE! This is NOT okay!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is awful. As much as I am used to it and actually like it, its quality is horrendous. I have to fight body and soul everytime I change my goddamn password or delete an account. In addition to that, the last update is terribly bad. When I try to change a reel's timing, it bugs suddenly. Honestly, the overall assessement is truly dissapointing, I personally used to love this app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I consider this app to be something of a scam. The app automatically hides pages almost as soon as you've downloaded them, even though they're still in the app. There's almost 200MB of material in the cache, but you cannot retrieve it because all Instagram want you to do is waste data downloading over & over again. There's some interesting stuff on here, but really it's for those who just wanna look at photos, some of which are very obviously & dubiously manipulated."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most recent update is an absolute pain. Can give me the option to add music to one or multiple photos and stays like this for a couple of days when all of a sudden batches of posts with music have had the music removed. Reels and posting stories onto my profilehave also been a struggle to make on the app as it consistently crashes and I have to restart all over again or just make my own reels but on a different app in order to post anything to the platform. Really disappointed in the new update.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So today I get an error message when I try to do anything ""cannot refresh feed"". Message failed to send. Something has gone horribly wrong. I have full bars of service and zero problems with any other apps/ internet. Recent update wiped out my actual ""newsfeed"" No I don't want to only see 3 suggested reels of people who I don't know. What is this? Slowly getting rid of yet another of the few parts of Instagram I actually liked. This app used to be about sharing photos with friends."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I find it difficult to maneuver around, and limited wording is frustrating. The Threads part is even more confusing as I never truly know if someone is really ""following"" me or if it is just written by those who want to be ""followed"" on Threads. I see people posting listing a lot of sentences, but I can not, especially in the bio section. This platform doesn't seem to be able to access all my photo albums, which I find limiting. I have agreed to allow Instagram to access my photos."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reels are great. Checking out posts are great, but I've been having this same ongoing issue with being able to listen to voice messages sent to me. I've reported it and updated the app. Given all the possible permissions I can give, but it still doesn't work. And it's stupid."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This would have been a better app if all those glitches are cleared and made this app bug free. Some messages cannot be seen even after it is delivered and I couldn't zoom the profile picture. There are more and more bugs that I couldn't list all of it out. Some features are available for some users and not for others. Hope those bug would be cleared at the earliest.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The background music for my multiple photos in a post (not reel) are gone although you could still see the name of the song on top. Also, I dont understand why I can't magnify or enlarge the stories with my fingers for one of my accounts while it can be done with my other account. It's useful when I can't read the captions. Thirdly, what happened to 'series'? It was great to categorize photos."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Low support for android, especially high end phone like s24 ultra. Having a few issues, which i would like it improve on high priority, 1. Sequence option, slider is not snappy and responsive. Video doesnt respond well by using a slider. 2. Touch to pause on Reels is too slow on android, whereas, on iPhone, when you touch on reels. It pauses very quickly. 3. Bad camera quality and too noisy. Please fix those issues. I dont know why instagram dont fix it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1. Removing the ability to unread messages was dumb. 2. Pausing reels wasn't necessary. 3. Sometimes the explore page refreshes; not showing you content you've liked/saved and instead showing scenery, things that would show on a new account. There's also just a lot of unnecessary updates that make the app worse! Stop adding things that don't need to be added. Ex. Pausing reels/moving the mute button! Ex 2. The share to threads button replacing the share to story one. There's much more."

Minus 1* because I had glitch and lost all accounts I followed. Now revived but some of them hung in requesting mode. It was a limbo experience for almost a week. TYSM developers!!"

The notification icon will say I have notifications, but then it's all ""suggested for you"" but most of the ""suggested"" are accounts where we dont have any friends in common. and mostly spam accounts. Also you can only pause notifications for 8 hours. After that there will be messages and what's in them going across the screen. Tried to turn it off or pause, but no."

They weren't broken so idk why they were changed, it doesn't look great and is very confusing, just keep it the way it was!! It was fine! Nothing. Was wrong, and if there was a bug, just fix that, not how it looks."

I don't know if it only exists in the android version or not but when you close the application via the home or back buttons most of the times, last video that was being shown on the app keeps playing even though the app isn't running in the foreground anymore. Many of my friends have this problem too. I'd be glad if you can solve this issue in the future updates. Thanks."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So for the past two weeks Instagram has been crashing on me and giving me an error every single time I try to open it. I've uninstalled and redownloaded several times, rebooted my phone several times, with the app either uninstalled or not installed to reinstall again, and it just doesn't work. It's not a problem with my phone. Instagram Lite is useless because it freezes and stops responding all the time. I used to like this app a lot but I'm sick and tired of this."

I also need the suggestions feature removed from my DM area, as it creates A CLUSTER. It is also, an unnecessary update feature (since we can always search a name & send a direct message) I don't see why it's needed!!"

Cool video, cute meter's , reels and stickers on the stories. But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying. Do better."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally reported in 8/2023. STILL HAPPENING. I must delete then reinstall the app multiple times a day. The app continues to revert back to the old version and glitch out. Stories are affected, missing filters and features like my avatar. My chat themes are a mess..

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram isn't what it used to be anymore. I've been using this app for years and years back it worked perfectly fine. There never were issues but since updates kept coming and certain things changed, there's constantly issues (that are rather annoying) popping up. Such as the inbox not working properly. Having to refresh in-app for messages to appear. Not being able to post or change pfp without the app closing itself, stories acting up weird, etc. kinda dissapointing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm having tons of problems posting. Constant issues with ""unable to save image"" errors. I removed old photos off my phone, cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, tried to post via my home WiFi and cellular data. Even with 40 GB free on my phone and doing the above, I still can't use more than 1 or 2 photos per post. I submitted an error ticket and heard nothing. It's certainly not inspiring me to pay for advertising if I can't make basic posts."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi there, please improve your saved post section. It's difficult to track saved posts not in collections & frustrating to find quickly. As Instagram is used for inspiration and ideas, we saved a lot of posts over time. And often struggled to find saved posts that aren't in any collection.

I can't select anything without getting a notification that two of my actions have been deleted as spam but when I click to see them, it says all of my content is fine and I have access to all features. If I exit out of this notification, the app becomes a blank white rectangle. If I restart the app, I'm immediately sent to the notification again. This happens across devices. The app simply does not work."

Oh, good, the reel restarted AGAIN. If only I could skip the part I already watched! Nope. Beyond being a waste of time in-general and showing you content you don't care about, even when you find something you DO want to see, this app's functionality is awful and seemingly intentionally wastes even more of your time. Trash"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst notification settings I've ever seen. I just want to turn off reel notifications. Is that really such a hard feature to implement? It's turned into junky adware. It's also somewhat clunky with how posts update. You'll open the app, see a post you want to read, and immediately, it disappears through the auto refresh (which you can't disable!). I wish there was an alternative. If you haven't created an account yet, don't bother. Meta has absolutely ruined this app."

My phone is a Samsung s23 FE, I don't know if that's the problem or not but I can't upload pitch black photos. The reason I want to upload them is for aesthetics but I can't. And, in one specific account, when I enable dark mode, it gives me more Navy blue ish background. I also can't hear my voice notes nor others voice notes when I'm on the phone. These issues are really irritating me."

I try and report the problem but I'm not sure if anyone works on it or even reads the emails. The platform is great when it all runs smooth, I have had anything but."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the latest update, reels cannot be fast forward nor can you rewind without it freezing or stopping or just fully restarting the video, sometimes even refreshing the entire thing so your reel is gone! The worst feature in my opinion is that it tries to skip to the next reel, *WHILE* you are WATCHING the one you're on! Sometimes I enjoy repeating the video or I'm busy looking at the comments. It is so incredibly frustrating and upsetting. I hate the new update."

It NEVER saves. Makes you start all over again. It's honestly very discouraging. Posting a quick video shouldn't be so difficult. Instagram needs an entire new development team. You guys are continuously dropping the ball. A lot of people use this app and you guys got egotistical and thought it was perfect....it's very, very far from that."

Most times, I have to edit the photos myself so it can fit into the frame provided by Instagram for posts which I am not satisfied with. Please, fix this and I will come back to rate it. I don't want my photos looking like a passport when the original plan wasn't for it to look like so. Please, fix this. Thanks in anticipation."

And for me as for an user they are not really easy to fix within ""user workarounds"". But these issues relate to different base parts of functionality that should work ideally by default. Even features like: followers sorting,photo editing,posting,stories,search - don't work correctly at all. I don't even tell about how Instagram spoils the photo quality however this app is about photos. It's a shame"

It's unusable. Not to mention if you leave the app for even a second it refreshes the feed and you lose whatever you were looking at. I know it's on purpose so you get distracted and spend more time on the app but I can't even use it for what I want anymore.

Besides that, please put the pop-up comments back to the end of the video, they are distracting at the beginning and not that useful like this. These experimental updates and feature tweaks are annoying and degrade the user experience."

I've tried resetting my passwords, opening my accounts from the website, and trying to log in through email links but nothing has been working. The lack in quality when posting an image is also very irritating. This app would definitely bring more people in if the ones behind it fixed the issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so frustrated with this app that I don't even know where to start. What's the point of having an option to crop a thumbnail for a reel for it to appear differently on the profile grid? In reels I work meticulously for them to look exactly how I want them to look, but when I post them, they are cropped differently. Jesus Christ. I like Instagram in general, but bugs like that are terribly demotivating. Please, fix this!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the update I am not able to navigate the timestamp bar at the bottom of reels. It's very irritating because often time I'd want to may be share a video and show a specific information in that video and that feature helped me to watch the video from between or from any timestamp I want. Now just vanishes as soon as I click on that thin bar. Please fix this, what's the point of having it if I cannot move forward/backward in a video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is just falling apart. Over emphasis on stories, random updates that change the layout/interface with no explanation on the changes, every version of the app appears to be different, video quality seems to have dropped since the recent update, the algorithm is awful and assumed that because you see something once that's all you want to see. Instagram, stop with the updates and just make this a simple app again"

I enter my email and password, but none of the 2FA methods are working. Won't send notifications. Won't send confirmation code text messages. Locked out and unusable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It seems there's a glitch where the bar at the bottom where I used to be able to fast forward to go to a specific spot in the reel isn't allowing me to do this anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch or if that feature was removed. But it is impacting my experience with Instagram pretty negatively because I don't want to have to watch the whole reel from the beginning if I want to see a specific part of the video.

But theres no way to see what you reported or the status on it. There is no true customer service for these issues atm which is very upsetting. No email. No chat. Nothing. Very frustrating. especially when i see message notifications and can see none of them. no access to new notes feature.Update: now It has a glitch with uploads. And kicks me out of app.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for fixing the bug but I want to give some feedback. When I was going through issues with my account, it was hectic trying to find help. To try reading all those articles or whatever on the help center page was not helpful. I recommend having chat support. At least then I can have someone to talk to and if it is a simpler issue, they can just redirect me to the specific page. This is better than having to frantically click all over the website, get more aggravated, and feel lost."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TERRIBLE BUGS OR TERRIBLE APP CHANGES!!! Keeps getting worse & worse! They removed the pause button a while ago - pls bring back! Now unable to fast forward or rewind videos bc the playback freezes so bad. Unable to see the button during playback that shows how long the video is or how far into the video you are. WHO IS COMING UP WITH THESE CHANGES - THEY NEED TO BE REASSIGNED!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app needs a serious overhaul and update. It is not for androids. Android users are getting updates late and the app is still continuously glitching. Update: 11/16/22 App is still glitching. I'm seeing posts that are 3 days old and it will not show me any new posts. What us going on with this app!? Too many bugs and glitches. When someone sends you a reel it doesn't open on that specific reel. It opens to something else.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Buggy, when viewing the followers/following list of anyone, it often scrolls back to the top, making you restart. Is this a permanent feature? It's been a problem for years. I've also uploaded a reel only to have its audio constantly replaying in the background even after I've clicked away from the upload, it stops once I fully exit and close the application."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lots of crashes and freezes, on latest version and new phone. Reel editing and multi-photo posts almost always freezes or creates weird behavior (audio out of sync, blank thumbnails, reverted edits, crashes, etc). A fine and fun app outside of actually trying to create content. 4/1/24 - reiterating the content creation UI is really bad. Posts without captions and cannot edit, videos become black screens, randomly rotating some slides. 4/5/24 - crashed while creating a 10 slide post of pics"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app since last year. It's been great and easy to use. Nowadays I have noticed that it shows unusual stuff like the reels aren't shown in the feed, I'm unable to log in my other account. I reinstalled it and it shows that there is a problem and I should try against later. I did try it but it's not possible to log in again. I request Instagram to kindly notice these problems and some other people also maybe having the same problem. thank you"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst apps. If it isn't glitching out, the algorithm is keeping you buried. I've tried the boosted ad's, and they barely meet the minimum reach but somehow still get all of the money. Now the like counter is hiding a large portion of the likes I received. You can view them in the insights, but they don't show on my profile. Help center hasn't replied to any of my reports or emails."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Any time I watch any video on the app and try to rewind or fast forward. It freezes, so then I have to leave the video and come back, and sometimes the line that allows you to press on it to rewind or fast forward comes back, and sometimes it doesn't. Also,the likes should be easier to find..it takes a long time to find my likes pic."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Instagram Explorer page completely messed up all of a sudden and stuff that I have never even encountered or interacted with is showing up on my feed. spent days trying to fix the algorithm and clicking on 'not interested' on each of those posts and even telling the algorithm to remove posts with those certain keywords but it's just not fixing or changing anything. it's been this way for months now. even reinstalled the app, tried vpn, complained to support center but no response and no fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When uploading stories, it says error and the red ring around my profile pic shows, but the story never really uploads. It especially happens for videos and when I zoom in and out on photos while in the story editing. Randomly logged out for 12 hours last week. The whole app freezes if I click pages or buttons too fast. Profile pics show as blank for a couple mins before finally loading. Stop laying people off, that's when all these glitches started!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good in general, but in the messages it has some bugs. It shows the person is online but they aren't and sometimes I get a message notification but even if I click on it the new messages don't show. The thing is: I left the beta mode, and even after I reinstalled the app multiple times I kept on it. I cleared the data and cache but it still doesn't work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's so unreal how buggy it is. Right now, I can't post any graphic that's not a video to my story. The whole post is just the background color no image visible. None of my text visible. The post can be clicked if you know it's there. I left the beta to see if that would help and redownload. No luck. Fix it please. Still happening. Edit: Now instead of uploading just the background it gives me the message ""couldn't upload"" and uploads nothing ."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app for use and like posting stories and pictures, sharing memes and texting, meeting new people. But with all these advantages and nice things some things i would like to state are that it just doesn't work for me sometimes. Like just now i was trying to log in into my account but it just kept showing error and even tho the pass and id were correct. My network is working completely but it just wouldn't load the messages even if i kept reloading it again and again."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App crashes often, features randomly stop working. It doesn't show you posts in chronological order. I just end up seeing posts from the same couple of accounts and a bunch of ads. My feed will say theres nothing new and start showing suggested posts, but then I'll click through accounts I follow, and there are several new posts it never showed me. Not at all user friendly, I just want to keep up with people and share things with my friends."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great app but I'm facing a problem so going to give a small suggestions. The problem I'm facing is whenever I'm watching a reel and went to my phone's home screen, the audio of the reel keep on playing even on stand by mode which forces me to close the app. So the suggestion is for the app to know whenever the app is not open but don't want to close it entirely. Because I might want to continue the reel. Thank You."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The lack of a feature to delete the entire like history on Instagram is a significant usability flaw. The current option to manually select likes, limited to only 100 at a time, is extremely inadequate. We urge Instagram to urgently implement a functionality that allows users to delete all likes simultaneously. This improvement is crucial to enhance user experience and ensure more effective control over personal data on social media platforms."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Me and a bunch of people are UNABLE to add text to stories unless we put a video in it! A picture won't work, it'll automatically tell you to delete the story. It's been like this for a week! I've had nothing but problems with this app. It's like it's purely developed by AI that was poorly coded by a 4th grader whose only programming experience was using Alice software in elementary school."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to rate this app 5 stars but with all the issues it's been having I'm dropping it down to a 2 star rating. Latest issue this app has had is the one where a lot of users (me included) were randomly logged out of their accounts. I've been putting my correct username and password and it keeps asking me for backups codes and when I put them it says invalid. I officially can't log back in to my account because of this dumb servers and issues that keep happening at least once or twice a month.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the new update, if you have to add another photo after uploading the first photo in a story, when you go to 'stickers' and choose the 'gallery/photo option, you can't CHOOSE a particular photo from different folders !! A random folder opens and you get only LIMITED photo options to upload! Anybody else with the same problem? This is so annoying!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear Instagram, I love you app so much because I can post stuff on story and send random reels to my friends, I wanted to inform you that recently whenever I try to skip certain reels video, I can't skip it, instead the reel freezes, so everytime I wanna skip a reel and save some time, I can't do it, please fix this problem. I love Instagram, even if something as little as the reel freezing is enough to make me not satisfied to use Instagram, so please fix it. Sincerely, your favourite user."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't get it.. I made a reel with audio (song) from Instagram.. but later on the audio is not available.. and I can't edit the video.. only the audio.. my reel looks ugly and stupid because it has different beat with the new song.. so what is the point of making reel directly from the apps.. and this app sometimes also doesn't allow an original sound/song
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IG has possibly the worst interface I've ever experienced. There is a progress meter at the bottom, but if you try to use it, the video pauses permanentlt. Mute? Permanent pause. Any kind of interaction but scroll up or down? (Which restarts the video) Start from zero. I give up. Jesus people, test the garbage you write before using it to sell my data."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really like the feature that when I press the volume down to be sure my volume is off before something in my feed makes a loud noise, ie in a Dr. Office. It just activates all the sounds. So innovative! So exciting. /s I hate it. Nearly rage uninstalled. The whole committee that approved that feature should be sacked, as well as whoever appointed them."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The autoscroll on reels is incredibly aggravating, there's a lot of times when I'm trying to read something in a reel and it just skips to the next one, and there's no way to turn this off it seems. Kinda makes me want to stop using Instagram all together. Update: since uploading this new review the app has randomly logged me out a couple times on my phone and is now saying this phone is a new device and I don't have access to some security settings for a bit because I logged into a ""new device"""
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You finally did it instagram! You got yourself a star from me. Lately this app is having plenty of issues, as you can see all the reviews about bug issues. I for one have been dealing with an issue of my own. The app keeps failing on me, it constantly doesn't let me use it, doesn't open at all. Maybe there's a new update but it doesn't show, my other apps work fine. I've done everything that I could to get it going, but no avail. Hope that you consider in fixing all these issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was all good and fun until a few weeks ago, my Instragram randomly starts glitching. I can't layout the pictures I want, at first it is okay but when I want to change the layout, it shows black and when I back out, it turns the whole pic to black. And just today, I was checking my dms and I saw that I can only see half the messages that my frn sent and that I had replied to earlier. I had even reported this issue three times before. I didn't expect this from Instragram."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Reel editor freezes every time I want to edit a video. When I finally got through it, the video wouldn't post (may have been my wifi so ok on that one). I deleted the app to see if the bugs were just from a previous version of the app. When I reinstalled it I couldn't get into my account without 2 factor auth, and the support page was buggy and wouldn't let me submit a support ticket. So frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been great, but ever since I woke up this morning, it's been bugging, and I can't log in or reply to any texts that I received overnight, and after reinstalling it, it won't let me log back in, it keeps showing up with ""unexpected error occurred"" like um excuse me? Let me log in. Yall better fix your app otherwise a lot of people are gonna start removing it from their phone"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for years and just starting to really dislike it more and more with every update. I primarily use IG for my stories because the capabilities are better and I can share it to FB with one setting. Convenient, I know.... Until ut stops working the way it's supposed to. I can't even record in my story anymore. Every time I try it deletes the whole thing and says the file type is unsupported. I've actually had to start recording stories on TikTok and just share them to IG, and to FB"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I signed up for an instagram account. I added maybe 10 friends, changed it to a private account, and added a profile picture. then you brats suspended my account. no idea why. I DIDN'T EVEN POST ANYTHING!!!!! it said I went against community guidelines, but there wasn't any content in the account to go against it. I have been searching and searching and can't find a way to contact any kind of customer support. The recovery stuff says I need a code from my phone, but won't send it to my number."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a good app until the recent updates. Reels are borderline unwatchable as none of the functions for them work. You can't scroll up or down without being sent to the main user's page, you can't click on the like button or see the comments without having to tap on them multiple times, and before, the rewind and scroller was broken too. Please fix these issues soon."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,P*rn ads starting to pop up in my feed. What the hell is going on Instagram? Changes to sending material to friends with the circular images isnt as good as the previous scroll down option... so I spend too long searching for friends profiles when it used to be easier. Last years changes to the insta feed s*ck. So I have to now sift through stuff I dont want to follow on the standard friends feed. Its hard enough to see my mates feeds as it is without this idiotic (and money minded ) change.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I know it's been like this for a long time, but honestly, whatever the reason is that you automatically shrink the photo size when I post to Story... no matter why. It's stupid. Obviously, no one wants their photo shrunk to cut out some of the picture... it should default to showing the whole photo regardless of Instagram's story, photo size default. I don't understand how this company got so massive with such an annoying setting. Do better."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I noticed some of my stories are missing from my archives, especially 3 out of 4 from 4/13. After updating and logging out of, and then, back into the app, the 3 appeared the archives. But the 1 that was previously showing is no longer there. I'm tired of having stories missing from the archives!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nothing works consistently, this app is a mess and forces me to use square aspect ratios if I don't want to post one picture at a time. The desktop version is worse, after editing and adjusting pictures, almost every time it says it can't post, and there's no ""save as draft"" on desktop so however much time I spent finding the pictures and adjusting them is just wasted. Makes me want to find another hobby, because trying to post anything I make here is a nightmare."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just started using insta and went through all my pics so I knew what I wanted to post. Whether story or feed seems like the limit of 10 photos or videos is pretty limited. Out of any vacation I have never just taken 10 photos. Trying to pick out of an amazing trip or adventure is impossible. Breaking up feeds or stories is nonsense. Would just stick to snap for stories going away. Gave into limit and picked 10. Hit share to insta and only stories/reel showed up. Select 1 and got feed, fix bug."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The reels section does not have the ""sound off"" option anymore. When I tap on the video it just pauses it and I genuinely hate this. That's the only reason why I use Instagram instead of TikTok because I love listening to music while watching reels, and now I cannot do it. Don't try to be ""innovative"" anymore. Just leave it be."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is frustrating! The bar for the videos no longer works. It makes the video freeze. You can't zoom in anymore without it freezing. There's so many ads also. Almost every other video is an ad. I keep seeing ads for a mr. breast game that is not owned by him like it says. How is this legal? Their using his name because they know how popular he is! Y'all finally fixed it to see the comments on a reel while in Facebook. But at the same time, it's still messed up. 500 characters is not enough"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The home feed autorefresh is out of control. If I set my phone down and the screen turns off or I look at any other app, it refreshed. Sometimes it refreshes my feed because I look at comments for more than a minute. It's an absolutely terrible user experience that you can't turn off the excessive automatic refreshing. Ypu can't even see the posts from people you follow because it's nonstop refreshing the feed. It's been an issue for some time and Meta just doesn't care to LET US TURN IT OFF."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It won't let me into my other account since I changed my phone number. It keeps saying that it's going to send a verification code to my new number and nothing happens. I almost got scammed trying to contact someone about it! Be more accessible when people have issues with the app!!! UPDATE: It still won't let me in. Offers to take a selfie video, great, and then asks for a password. Guess what? Doesn't accept any passwords. No one has gotten back to me to help."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had so many issues with this app over the years, but most get worked out fairly quickly. This must recent one is horrible though. I cannot even open the app. Every time I try, my screen just goes blank. Nothing comes up at all. I can't log in on any of my accounts like this. I can't check messages. I can't see any data, post anything, just nothing at all. I cannot find any way to take off the latest update so I can at least get some functionality back... just everything is blank."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I came back after being disgusted with Tik Tok and YouTube shorts. It is still dismal. They constantly try to get you to watch reels, which is super annoying. I also posted something, and it was immediately buried. Imagine trying to show your friend a picture on your phone, but somebody grabs your phone from your hand and puts one hundred photos on your phone that your friend has to scroll through to see your photo."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is Instagram having such a hard time loading on my phone? I even bought a new phone to solve the problem & it still takes 5-8 minutes to load my feed. Also, posts on the feed should have the option to be shown chronologically (newest post first). I would also love a way to re-set the search page that has recommendations of posts we might like. I'm not the same person that I was three years ago & I'm still getting outdated suggestions. Your app needs work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Randomly stops sending of messages, randomly stopped me from getting into my instagram account for a few weeks without any warning or email or anything, the dark mode switching to light mode breaks all the time, and messages in dms just randomly dissapear. Quality lowers even when changing the setting to only high quality when sending photos from camera roll. Calls don't connect to my headphones even though it says connected audio and calls. Very buggy and terrible app overall."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't even log in properly. I've tried everything to log in to my old accounts. But there seems to be an error everytime and saying ""couldn't refresh feed"". This has happened TWICE with some of my old accounts too, I had to create new ones and now there's a trouble logging in in my new ones too. Too many bots and definitely not a safe place for kids. Really poor service even after I tried everything including, fixing my wifi, clearing the app cache, even restarting my device."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately Instagram has become almost useless to me. I used to search for things on this app would always find plenty of results of what I was looking for but now the search results are useless, limited and lots of searches are simply empty. It seems like it only shows a fraction of results related to a has tag you search or none at all. It's a shame.."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of my go-to doom scrolling apps, it has been completely ruined by recent updates. From automatically scrolling to the next reel while I'm reading comments, to vibrating each time I like a comment, to ""sponsored reels"", etc. With no settings to turn off any of these features, I can't stand using this app anymore. Don't even bother with this app, just download tiktok instead."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You need to fix the new update. I just updated the app yesterday, and I've noticed that the text bubbles are a lot longer than they were. The text bubbles on my side are a lot bigger, and it makes the recipients' texts look tiny in comparison. Longer messages take up the whole screen because the text bubbles are messed up. Please stop doing things like this and revert whatever this new update is that did this back to normal and back to how it used to be."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is such garbage. Doesn't keep your edits making a post and loses all information on config changes. Every heard of saved instance state? Multi billion dollar company and can't implement the most basic Android functionality. Plus stories fail to upload for no reason, stuck in endless ""try again"" loop. Update: now crashes when trying to add a video to a post. How is this worse a year later?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Videos always freeze and glitch, which results in me closing the app and losing the reel I was previously looking at. I hate that posts on the explore page automatically scroll up. Now I can barely click comments, and I don't like that it pops up ""report spam, post on story etc etc,"" when you barely touch a comment. The algorithm is also horrible! I am tired of seeing the same posts that I saw days ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Stop moving the Link Copy option every other day!!! HATE where you buried the option to copy a link or share. So annoying! I have friends that stay on the app throughout the day because we constantly share links. We could do it quickly with the old format. Too many steps now mean we will spend less time on the app! We have tried it today. Massive FAIL! So unbelievably annoying and time consuming. I use the app less and so do friends when we can't find the copy link option to forward something.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever new update they rolled out is awful. Specifically on reels. The buttons don't work anymore, you'll press share and it'll bring you to the creator's profile, comments and it'll pause and become non-responsive to touch. The UI is horrible for such a common app. Did you hire children to complete the coding? There's a new auto-scroll feature that I blame for it - and who needs it? I can scroll on my own, I don't need the phone to dictate when I'm done on a certain video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too much publicity and the algorithym makes it difficult to actually see friends publications. It stoped being about seeing what friends are up to and instead its about them (instagram) showing as much advertisements as possible. I would even consider paying to stop having advertisements. I think it would be outrageous that it came to that since that was its whole point, seeing friends, but I'd still do it. Also, its help service doesn't work, they do not respond/solve problemas."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Few suggestions for functionality that could improve the app. Introduce the concept of close friends for each post (or each posted pic among a series). So that people who want to post pictures for a limited audience within their account might be able to do so. When people accept the friend request, they should be able to control if the user can be added to close friends list or not. Suggestions for hashtags to be used would be a plus (usage of generative ai). Square frame editor"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Someone hacked my account. This person activated my account which was deactivated for over a year and posted scammer stories and my mutual friends got confused. One person actually believed and tried to invest in. This person also changed my email address so I cannot access to changing password. As well as I tried with phone number option, but the second authenticator made me unable to change password, which I don't have. This is so frustrating. And there's no one that's trying to help me from."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One decent update that Instagram got was the feature that enabled us to scroll through the reels in a chat. I had been wishing for this feature for longer than I can remember. Closing a reel and reacting and then opening another reel is fine when you have normal friends. My friends send 300,000 reels at once (exaggerated but you understand). I praised Instagram for that to everybody around me. Now you've gone and undone that update. Please give it back. üôèüèª"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's so great you can (theoretically) upload more than 10 images per post now. But this is useless when the app keeps crashing when you try to post. Once it finally worked it only posted 6 of my pictures and the rest is just white. Please don't take months to fix this like you did when adding music was bugged...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is the best social media platform that provides more entertainment all over the world. Supporting and helping people like creators and bloggers. However, please add the pause option in Reels. When we are reading comments, the reel plays automatically many times.

I want what I'm actually interested in back, and I've submitted four support requests in two weeks, all of which have vanished and I haven't got a single response. This app is going downhill fast, and I've already cleared my storage cache, uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Edit: it got fixed great! I uninstalled it and Reinstalled it because it had a bug that won't refresh the page even that I restarted my phone and didn't work after a few days I came back to see that the page that couldn't refresh but their were no videos/posts that was before and it couldn't load at all ik this might not help to uninstall an reinstall but I had to do it I got scared I hope that the bug thing could get fixed!!(I will change my review to 5 if you fixed it) please I need this app!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since jan 2024 there's an intermittent use of using the slider on the reels to fast forward or rewind. Was on a pixel 7 Pro, reinstalled and still persisted. Now I'm on galaxy s24 and it's still doing it. Worth. Voting I think it glitches if you tap and pull to fast forward and then leave the video and go back to it and the sliders gone. Probably designed to force you back into the infinit scroll. Go fys"

It's a humble request to fix this bug cause it's my personal data which I don't like to share depending on which post I like or not. So, please fix this bug and let me know about this as soon as possible."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason, The chat list takes years to load. Not to mention that if someone texts me I don't even get the notifications, I've been using this app for years now but this is new. Neither I have any internet issue, nor I have notifications turned off. I've tried re- installing, but it doesn't work. Please fix this stupid issue and I'll give a 5 star. I Hope you would fix this, or at least give me a solution"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This issue has been going on for three days. I can't use the Instagram explore page, and I've checked my internet connection and it's fine. Then, I tried using my second account, which worked, but when I tried using my main account, it didn't work. I had sent you an email but the team was didn't respond my emails. Please slove this problem as soon as possible"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Status privacy settings should be changed according the preference. i dont like that my friend can see that they are in close friend they dont have to know about that so there should be an option of group that can choose a group of people without knowing that they are only people who are taged in the post

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"OK, scheduling doesn't work, won't upload even though I can post in real time so not an Internet issue. It did upload 2 and then it just won't upload. Tried over days, re-downloaded the app etc... I wish it automatically saved to drafts when this happened so you weren't re-typing when it fails. As usual tonnes of ads, so I don't use it to look at anymore, why would you choose to watch so many ads?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"**Update** Insta has been an absolute headache recently. Since the last update the audio cuts out 1/4 - 1/2 way through videos I'm creating. I create the whole video, get the title ready, hashtags, etc only to find out the audio has cut out 1/3 of the way through the video. This is getting beyond frustrating. I'm not the only person this is happening to though as I've been in contact with other creators who have said the same happens to them."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app just keeps getting WORSE. Not only do I always have issues sending messages to people (stuck on ""sending"", I have to reinstall the app to fix) but now I can't even forward reels without it freezing and glitching. What is going on with the dev team?! Do you guys not test the software before publishing updates? Unreal!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Instagram experience for me is what used to be not a big fan of, recently changed ,as I realized how many awesome photo filters there is on here! Wow amazing filters for everyday photos you can edit, save, delete, whatever . Not to mention it's a very good way,as is Facebook, to connect to basically anyone in a convenient quick fashion."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm extremely annoyed by this app. Generally it is a good way to interact but lately it's become so frustrating. I'm in process of watching a short video then bam, screen goes to sleep. Now, I first thought it's my mobile device but it's not as no other app does this. Not even FB. I've checked all the IG settings can't find anything to extend or turn it off. Please fix this nonsensical display."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Oh, Instagram is one of my favorite apps! It's a great platform for sharing photos and videos with your friends and followers. You can post your own content, like and comment on others' posts, and even send direct messages to connect with people. The app has a lot of fun features like filters, stickers, and stories that allow you to get creative with your posts. Plus, you can discover new accounts and explore different interests through the Explore page. Overall, Instagram is a fantastic app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's gotten worse over the years. It doesn't show you the most recent post in order. It will show you suggested post that no one wants to see. The algorithm is so messed up. It only shows you post on who you follow or interact with. I prefer to see people's post in time most recent times. Not post from 7 days ago then 22 hours ago. I follow 300 influencers but only show me the top 50 . It's annoying. I would delete this app permanently but I have all my memories stored on this application.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE INSTAGRAM. BUT Please stop overcomplicating apps that work perfectly fine. Updates should fix bugs and add value to the user, like being user friendly, fast and efficient. Anything else is unnecessary. Also, Please don't turn Instagram into Facebook. Facebook is literally just a advertising page now. And it's really not enjoyable, as a user nor as someone that does social media marketing. Just get back to your roots - and simplify things again."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since Jan 2024, follow button is just white and nothing inside, can't navigate videos anymore (fastforward or rewind, bar is there initially but if you click it stops and can do nothing about it), memory leak with app (uses immense resources and continuously increase memory usage and CPU requirements), image quality dropped on videos and pictures in multi-posts (after 1st posted image or video). Still, after months, no way to select all saved posts and unsave all simultaneously. App needs debug."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last two updates I have been unexpectedly logged out of my account so many times. At first I thought my account was getting hacked but now I think it's the app it self, thought updates was to make the app better not worse but it keeps happening for no reason. I'll be on it then I'll get an error message then I'm logged out. Please fix tired of it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest misadventures. For over a month my explore feed has been assorted India/Bollywood, people dancing, generic nature photos, and other nonsense I've never shown any interest in. Many on Reddit reporting the same thing. Like others, have tried everything to fix it and it's still completely trashed. Terrible app. Non existent support, to boot."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app's story is buggy, i cannot repost posts without it giving me only a blank background, even for the texts i add on the stories, they don't appear, plus the options to post either only text or in grids isn't available on the left. I don't what's up but i even restarted my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app and still got the same problem plus the app's update downgraded to previous update (this excluded pausing Reels with a tap, full screen reels repost) and i wasn't a beta tester."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was working great, then out of nowhere, my direct messages started glitching out and so I can see that I received a message but I can't see the message itself and no matter what I do, restart the app/phone and it still doesn't work and the issue is still there. I even tried logging in and out and uninstalling it which didn't work. Plz fix this"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"horrible and laggy. The app used to be bearable but now every other thing is breaking. The text disappears or turns black randomly (dark mode), stories dissappear or dont load from my archive (I have story saving on) and everything takes forever to load and is generally a laggy mess. (My phone itself is fine, instagram is up to date and everything else on my phone works spectacularly) fix your app meta."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been coming down with alot of bug recently and it's very annoying. Alot of people are complaining about it but nothing is being down. All my saved filters for my stories got unsaved today morning when I went on the app and it does not all me to search for filters and when I added some filters from other people's stories, 1 hour later it all got unsaved again. Please sort out this problem immediately because it is very frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi Instagram developers, It's been a while you guys are not fixing the audio issue we are facing. When we are changing the video speed to lower rate like .4 .5 the original audio is not getting muted although I am choosing mute original audio. This is really a big issue while creating a reel. Everytime I need to use another aap and remove audio and then create the reel in Instagram. It's like double effort for the same work. Could you please check this issue and prioritise this?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Please stop the algorithm from suggesting reels about topics that people can find annoying or irritating, especially of the suggested reel is something they hate. The new update is very buggy and has rendered the hashtag useless. The algorithm also keeps pushing reels and posts that people don't like to see into their suggested reels and feed, even if people have not even interacted with the content of the reels before. Would be very much appreciated if this gets fixed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lots of weird bugs. My explore page hasn't shown me personalised/tailored content in like 5 months. For a good month it was also only showing me misogynist content?? I should be seeing crafts, bears and anime based on who I follow and interact with but theres nothing. Using the filters and such in settings had no effect. I did submit a report but nothing changed either. And right now I can only post two photos at a time? Its bizzare. :("
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Instagram is a handy and easy-to-use app which provides tons of information in a friendly way according to ur taste. A few times we experience Instagram's glitches which is really frustrating but then again not everything is perfect It's also an earning platform for hundreds of thousands of people which elevates it's rank overall
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Glitches all the time. For about 4 months get notified about receiving a message and it takes anywhere from 5 minutes to a week for me to access the message no matter how many times I send troubleshooter reports. Sometimes the app will randomly crash and even rebooting phone won't work. Had to Uninstall and install app a good 10 times in the past 4-6 months
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use the app everyday however the last few updates have been pissing me off due to bottons being moved (seems to be normal now) but also they changed the messaging format. Now messages stretch across the screen. It's ugly. I hate it. Fix the messages insta. If I wanted to I could go in detail about the different issues I've come across but the messaging format really irritates me the most. Please tell me I'm not the only one y'allüò≠
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram is the biggest social media platform but still it can't handle 4k and HD videos. I mean my hd videos always get laggy after posting them and I don't the why. I hope they fix this as soon as possible and they also need to focus on the quality improvement. This is my only problem with Instagram. Also I hope they bring back IGTV. I don't know why they removed it at the first place. Soo now even a long video is converted into a reel and it's not ok for various reasons.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Settings do not actually change anything. Turned off notifications from people liking comments. Those notifications still pop up. All the time. What's the point of giving the option to change settings if they don't actually change the settings Edit: still hasnt changed. New though, somehow while scrolling, I got logged out entirely??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If i could i would rate it in the negative . It's always something up with this app. I chased them for about almost a year to get help with a problem i faced with my payments account and nothing .. i had to create another account in hopes for it to get fixed but then again i failed. They show 2 options for payments account when you are creating a promotion for a post but you cannot chose the one other than facebook payments account . They just want to bully into creaying a facebook account !

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Less follower activity & more random content on personal feed. If you switch apps for 1/2 of a second the page refreshes entirely. No sense of continuity. Just overwhelming, overstimulating hogwash constantly. It's fine at times and was available through the explore tab. Now it's the whole of the IG experience. Hiding posts or indicating you don't want to see certain topics seems to only increase the amount of times you'll see that specific content. Funny memes and wide range of content"

I have a big problem with fake accounts and nothing seems to be done about it. It was a great app but since last update my music on my reels don't work properly and everything isbout of sinc they are promoting reels. Not impressed. Now my reach as just about gone and finding it so hard at the moment on this platform, which I used to enjoy so much"

Clicking the slider causes it to disappear. The translate comments feature is only available super randomly, maybe 1 in 1000 comments. My comments are constantly getting flagged for spam for literally no reason at all. Reels aren't fitting the screen ratio and the left side of the caption is cut off. Did meta layoff too many folks and now engineering is going down the tubes or??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Where to start? This app has never ""fit to frame"" anything... ever. I thought with the FB merge, this would be a priority, but no.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I didn't thought that Instagram will be this much problematic. I can't send animated messages also I made a new second Id on my Instagram a while ago but they only give the reels option on my first one , I can't add Stories longer than 14 seconds even after the new update and many more problems. Seriously, These problems should be fixed! I uploaded this review 4 months ago, still no action taken!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app has been full of problems related to the follow button. I had to uninstall it. I hope it will work better after reinstalling. Edit: INSTAGRAM IS FULL OF PROBLEMS. NOW it has blocked me from giving likes and following people on the basis that I used a program I did not use. I sent several reports with messages and multiple attached screenshots but never received an answer. Awful user service.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix your app ! I don't understand how after all these years, even with a flagship smartphone I'm getting poor performances from instagram. The camera is laggy and so are reels. The crop and the compression of posts makes it super hard for photographers to post the actual composition they were looking for. Probably the app with the worst algorithm as I'm getting targeted by the same 3 subjects all the time. Update: it got even worse With flipside it's almost impossible to add people as it loads"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The recomendations Instagram gives me based off of my personal intrests are great. The texting feature on the app is also really great, its easy and conveinient and even allows you to share content that you enjoy with content that others may enjoy. Moving on to the reels, the reels are great I like how you can give credit to people and or artists for sounds/songs. I also enjoy the comment section so that you can see what other people thought of the video and say what you though about It. *10/10*"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app for connecting to the world. I love the diversity of what you can view and whom you can connect with. I would like to see more real followers...not bots..the algorhythms sometimes do not let me reach my full audience and I believe this can be improved to make Instagram even better to reach full potential and satisfy every user especially artists and businesses!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The photo editor is appallingly buggy. I often can't use the highlight of shadow tools, nor can I use the colour editor. Annoyingly, it also crashes when you try to add a new photo to a selection of edited ones for a post! Not to mention, the app simply does not work properly with Google Photos (which 99% of Android users use) meaning that I can't ever make a proper post since photos don't show up in chronological order, and *I can longer open the Photos app from Instagram anymore either*!!"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is bloated with bugs due to the fact that you keep updating it too often. You get one star for removing funny GIFs for no reason. App would be greater if they would listen to the community. Decisions are taken very poorly. Plus that your ads persist even when you click it's irrelevant/seen too many times, and recently, I see them more and more often. Every 3 reels I see an ad. A bit too much wouldn't you say?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is great for connecting with friends and sharing moments, but the algorithm can be frustrating, burying posts from loved ones.

Predatory notifications that wait 5-10 minutes after you close the app to tell you that you have a new message, but then when you go into the app its just the same message you read 20 minutes ago. Does it just so you're back in the app consuming content again. Was fun years ago when it was just about being an image editor and putting some pictures up, but it's been downhill since they got rid of picture frames and everything became a marketing hustle."

Just don't waste your time, even tiktok is better than this right now.

Well if put the cursor further back in the paragraph, I can backspace the word but when I start typing it moves my cursor back to the end of the paragraph where I left off.

Reported multiple times and it hasn't been taken down. The log in details were all changed before being able to confirm in an email that it wasn't the person's account. 7 days later, the account is still up and is clearly a scam account now. Also, having top comments pop up on instagram reels is really annoying."

It either erases everything (no matter at what step I can be) and makes me lose all the progress or it posts pics completely altered that they do not look like what it is posted. Some of them have posted even in just black. Similar things happen when posting reels, where it repeats the pics or videos and it does not warn you.

Cant post a series of pictures anymore. Now it has to be a reel to a ridiculously short bot of music.

Nothing shows up in chronological order, and if you accidentally go to another page when you come back, all the posts will be different. It's awful.

I follow people i know so i can see their posts but now im not even seeing that. My home page should not turn into the reels page after ive seen all the most recent posts. This app was pretty decent but now its so ridden with adds and garbage reels that its almost unusable. Then they use this app to try and shove threads down your throat.

I mostly like the new download option,that has made a lot of things easy. But one thing I think they should add is a way to be able to restrict certain followers from viewing your post -and not just your story- without having to block them. Also there should be a way to delete certain messages without having to delete the whole conversation or unsend it. This would be a great add on. Thank you. Keep up the good work."

Please just make it so you have the option to access what you want to post via the albums. When you simply post a story you still have that option, just make it for adding to stickers to strs!"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've got a lot of problems with recent version, it's all about stories content, I can't share images edited on photos app, and if I want to edit a collage, the screen becomes black, I don't care at the start, but now, it's unsupportable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App freezes consistently after recent update. Comments get removed without a valid reason, and when I look up the ""Community Standards"" I find out Ai and 3rd party communications are in charge of moderations. Awhile back Instagram automatically went through everyone's settings and ""limited content"" from certain creators to keep them from having a voice. Contemplating deleting permanently."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what the hell is happening with the app whenever i try to make a voice or video call the screen gets totally black and then suddenly my device goes directly to auto reboot and just stuck gets stuck in that situation like loop. And it's only happening when i use insta calling feature.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Each update is worse. Trying to make a real, when you use different filters or try to put music sometimes all of the buttons disappear and you can't click back. So you have to close the entire app which also loses all of your progress. Just going downhill over the years, eventually instagram's just going to be unusable"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The function of disliking multiple posts at once is unfortunately unusable. I try to dislike 30 posts by mass selection, but it just shows a pop-up message stating that something has gone wrong. I just want to be able to clear all of my likes so that I can get a clean start without making a new instagram account."

Edit: now I need to uninstall/reinstall every few weeks to see videos that people send in DMs. But I guess the ""reels"" are working out for Facebook's business, yeah? ü§¢ Edit: now, whenever I like a comment, the phone vibrates. No way to turn it off. Might as well stop engaging with the comments sections"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You won't stop asking for a review. So fine. Posts glitch. Reels are broken for my viewers and break less than 20 seconds in. Constantly clips and crops my images so I have to sacrifice size and quality to make anything fit within your stupid grids. Not only that but you have LEGITIMATELY no way of contacting customer support about actual issues; I've reported a scam product for more than 6 months and no one can find anything wrong with a product that's actively causing health concerns. Ok.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is constantly glitching and I can't use my side buttons on my phone to take selfies, which means a selfie stick is pointless. I know iPhone users were having this issue first. I'm on a Samsung. Can't edit videos. If try to upload a video I took with my own camera phone, it won't allow it. You can't send voice messages that are longer than a minute, which is weird because Insta is supposed to be part of Meta and I can leave 10 minute voice messages on FB chat but not insta chat."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am a user of this app since 2015 and recent updates have made it much worse to use. Colours that overlap background colours, reels section not loading even when you have a stable connection, unreasonable amount of ads and boosted content plus frequent app crashes. Updating app with the hopes of getting bug fixed is a big deal to ask for apparently now. Instead of launching games through emojis, try fixing your app first."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm always into reels so I think it's becoming more like tiktok but way beyond its standards when it comes to reels and using filters. I'm delighted to promote Instragram as one of the best social media platforms to connect with new people all around the world. It helps me alot while using this platform and if you're someone who haven't created an account, I suggest you better download this app and start to create one for yourself. You'll enjoy new features and it's beneficial to young people."

I've clicked let us know, and made a report about this but has anythingh happened? No, it got worse. Now the same thing is happening when I try to follow anyone.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm sick and tired of our much this app refresh. If you say on one page too long and your screen goes off, no matter how fast you unlock it, it refreshes the whole app, and you start over. Plus, whenever you leave a comment, you no longer get to see it in a paragraph format. It's just one long page, and it's hard as hell to proof before you submit it, then you see it. Whatever they did to this app, it truly stinks."

My messages disappear and sometimes the videos stop loading. Using note20 ultra so the hardware is also not an issue. Update 2024 : The issues keep on worsening, the reels dont work, lags and lags.

And cause more bugs that prevent me from commenting(it doesn't even show that I'm suspended)... so, like, what is it with Instagram constantly removing QoL features?

For hackers it is so easy to hack whereas for users it appears as if it is highly secured. After account getting hacked there is hardly any support from Instagram. Soon it will be the next orkut.

The product of greed and neglect. The purview of the preview of the modus operandi--a society who exists en mass exodus. An insight to cite the conventional. No more art. No more losing.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like Instagram I feel like a favors ios more than Android because it's compresses photos and videos to hell making android look bad vs iPhone that actually look better. It's not the android phone it's self because the quality is great with Samsung and Google phones just to name a few phones with great cameras but it's the app that's not optimize for those phones. Google or the the developer has to figure out a way to optimize this app for Android OS.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,One thing that disappointed me is that it doesn't have any options like 'select multiple followers' to 'remove' them. It becomes very difficult to remove those unwanted followers one by one. So Instagram should look into this matter and try to introduce this type feature where one would be able to select and remove multiple unwanted people from the followers list. I'm facing a lot of problem due to this. Please solve it. Thank you.

Literally filled with endless bugs and for some reason it logged me out and when i try to log in back nothing happens and doesn't work. Not only that but its also a toxic place filled with racism/sexists/etc..and another example is whenever there's a reel of disabled person the comments just make fun of them to the point it crossed the line. Either the app will fix itself in the future or just stay like this till its shutdown

While watching reels, the app doesn't respond at once to tapping on the caption, same is while tapping on likes, tagged person's name, etc. Also as on iOS, while tapping anywhere on the screen, it does not pause the video, instead mutes it.

There's more...i can't make group w/o encryption.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the last update, it has been bugging out. I'm not able to change the layout of the stories template, it just changes to a black screen. I have tried un-installing and re-installing it, and I've cleared the cache, restarted pH and it's still doing it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"my stories are disappearing from my highlights and when i go to the stories archives they're not there anymore either, i don't understand how that could happen, it's entirely ruining the experience for me as stories are the feature i use the most. edit : every story filter i saved disappeared, there's only the official instagram filters there rn.. what is going on??!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram this new update prevents you from forwarding or backing up a video clips. NOW IT FREEZES!. You previously had that convenience why change and eliminate that? Sometimes we need to re-listen to something that was said... and now you have to start from the beginning to rewatch the entire thing. Please put that back in place!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The slider / scroll bar for watching videos - to go forward or back does not work. When I attempt to scroll forward in a reels video, this causes the video to pause and crash. This has been like this for 2-3 months. Please fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible experience. Meta verified is overpriced and doesn't work. The app shuts off by itself for no reason at all. Sometimes the music I add to my reels just keep playing in the background. Speaking of reels. Reels often stop completely. This app is garbage.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good one but there are few issues with d app & one of them which concerns me is- there should b some system or arrangement where we come to know that which effects are Instagram effects & which r 3rd party effects while making reels because most of the time when I try to boost d reel it gives me this message that it can't be boosted since d effects should be created by Instagram only. So there should be something which tells us about this since it takes a lot of hardwork for a reel.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lot of bugs and too many glitches!! We want back the mute option on reels , even now after the lastest update we can't rewind or take forward the reel properly ( this option was the best till now but its not working properly) It's my humble request to team Instagram to solve all the bugs and glitches! ASAP"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Inability to snooze suggested post ruined my experience. I practically want to uninstall the app after this update. This is just bad customer experience. I would not like to see suggested post on my timeline. For that I can simply go to Explore Page. This is just instagram forcing us to see literally anything and everything. Very Disappointed!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is this app just getting worse day by day? It's showing Couldn't refresh feed although I have a stable internet connection. Also the timeline under the reels isn't working, I've been logged out of my account around 5-6 times now... and now my dms aren't loading and I'm unable to send any messages...you really need to fix this asap... there's no other option left other than deleting this app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I added the Instagram app to my phone and signed up. Everything seemed fine for an hour. Then I received an email saying my account was suspended. I clicked through and now it's saying I have to add a mobile number. I did that, and clicked send code, only to repeatedly get the response ""code not sent"". Instagram help center provided no assistance."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram has been having MAJOR issues with the login! I also had 2 accounts connected to the same email but because you can no longer have 2 accounts on one email it has been completely difficult trying to gain access to the accounts. The worse thing to happen to Instagram is connecting to Meta. It sucks now.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"4/1 Update: Unable to comment on any posts. Every time there's a new update, app is super buggy on Android devices Blank screen for 3 weeks. Nothing loads. Was able to get it to work by downloading an older version but this also crashed after a few days. Pls do something"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very annoying that when I'm watching a reel, the screen keeps moving up & down, & the app tells me that I can swipe up for more reels. I've been using this app before reels existed. This is very destracting when I'm trying to stay focused on a reel, but then, my screen starts bouncing up & down. Bad design choice."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is getting increasingly hard to make stories and posts on. If you don't have an apple phone you can forget about having the latest updates! I just had an update and it undid all my profile links to Facebook Pages. One I cannot get linked back up because my two step verification code NEVER sends to me. I am fully blocked out of my own account in which I clearly have the login information for. I cannot run my business page successfully in this app anymore!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had been my favorite social media app for years. Unfortunately it's totally devolved into a terrible user experience. Non-existent support, (GOOD LUCK reporting problems through the channels provided), garbage algorithm restricts your reach regardless of follower count, top it off with the errors and glitches and its a real struggle. Would strongly advise new social media users to look elsewhere unless they somehow right this ship."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,New to Instagram but I like it. Would like to see support for portrait and landscape images though instead of just square. Also I noticed that the app doesn't seem to support animated GIF images. Please improve! Support for vertical and landscape video is good.

Is it so hard for you to make uploading videos a little better after all these years? I wasted 2 hours but I couldn't upload a simple post, it just stuck at some percentage and doesn't continue at all. That's it, no warning, no error massage, not even a god damn cancel button!!! Seriously? I must uninstall and reinstall the app every time uploading a video stucks???..."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In ads, the comments are invisible. They should not be due to companies creating misleading ads (especially game ads). Whenever I go to edit a comment while I'm writing it and move my cursor to anywhere within it, as soon as I type a single character, the cursor jumps to the end of the comment. Stories from reels that are longer than 15 seconds will stop playing at the 15 second mark and just stay there instead of jumping to the next story."

I like a video on someone's story and it says I can't leave a message to use the recent app. How? I like it and they don't get the reaction. It freezes, take awhile to load a picture or video. I shouldn't have updated it. Please fix!"

Plus, I can also see the music song and the artist name on the top of the post, like I mentioned, I'm unable to listen to that song and the audio enable and disable is also not available.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Looking at others posts is fine and dandy but for like a decade now I've always had issues when posting/uploading stuff. It's crazy to me I still run into issue after issue when trying to post to this day. Update: they also don't accept reports of bots or hacked accounts. - update: about another year later, my posts still just end up black screens."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The toughness on actions like following and liking for new accounts is too severe and has created a very negative experience for me as an artist. Joining as an artist you naturally want to get established, connect with others and there is so much exciting art to like too. Being constantly punished just for being enthusiastic and for actions that instagram also pushes on you has been an awful experience for me. The total lack of communication too and all the hidden rules - just awful!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great social media app having extensive features but still some features can be added to make it more user friendly and enhance user experience like edit a comment. One feature that i think would be beneficial if added, is add or remove a song from the posted photos any time."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The AI spam detection has made this app so much less fun to use. I have zero violations but I'm not free to use my account because I said something NICE on a clothing companies account and it happens all the time. Not to mention the glitchiness of creating stories and anytime you're trying to post multiple photos, the app automatically resizes all of them after the first photo. This app is garbage."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram is a great app for communication with your pairs but the only reoccurring issue that I have been getting is that I'm only getting logged out of my account. It's only 4 in the evening and I've been logged out approximately 5 times! And also when I tried logging back in one time it told me the owner changed their password and I was unable to log in. Other than that issue Instagram has been working fine for me.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whatever recent update that instagram decided it was a good idea to make Reels autoscroll without a way to turn it off is super annoying. I'm starting to get really pissed off when I'm trying to read comments on a reel and I close the comments and it's moved like 4 reels on its own in the background.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love taking photos and videos in Instagram cos of it's filters by using my Samsung S Pen as my action button to take pictures and I find it really convenient.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have to keep uninstalling the app because it keeps freezing and won't scrole on my phone. I've done this three times now. Update: Instagram is terrible with reels and won't let me at a caption to them. I am absolutely fed up of this and I've been trying all day to add a caption and it just isn't happening.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nothing but issues. New posts disappear before you can like/ read them. Timeline no longer exists, it's either weeks old posts or bombarded by suggested posts. Have to go to persons profile page to see their new posts since they disappea. Freezes constantly..

Hashtags hardly ever work. Guides are gone. Notification system and settings are terrible. I constantly have to redownload the app because of some glitch that prevents me from posting or using the app at all. All of my support requests are unanswered. I wish Instagram would stop trying to be TikTok or Twitter/X. Go back to being a cool photo sharing app!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is the resize function for this app so terrible? If you're posting multiple images, the pic automatically zooms and you can't adjust to fit screen. New update: story layer doesn't work on android (can't move text or pictures around). Very poor experience."

I fear opening up this app at work now. (Mostly from funny pages and sometimes the pages I follow that show cars or home decoration and tech.) Not to mention how many scammers are on this app as well. Something gotta change fast! And people are worried about tiktok smh

A lot of annoying pop ups and redundant information. 66mb update for what? Atleast give people the option to customize these settings. Hate using the app now"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Android app is failing to detect proper inputs such as opening comments when the share button is pressed (or anywhere on the screen is pressed for that matter) It's also operating very oddly such as showing comments for the previous video when a subsequent video has been scrolled to. Or simply doing nothing at all (rejecting all input when a button or region of the video is pressed to prompt an activity) Also commenting fails randomly without retry
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So the Meta AI features just showed up on my version of the app and they quite frankly suck. There's no option to disable the feature which is whatever until you scroll on your feed and the Meta search bar STAYS ON THE SCREEN. The chat bot set up for the AI also shipped with zero instructions - I tried asking it how it can be turned off and the first answer it always gave was ""press the three horizontal lines"" in the search bar or chat screen"" only for there to not be such a thing in either."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for social media, but it's extremely buggy. Skipping time in reels breaks the entire video, im unable to report or delete comments, Dms are malfunctioning too. Edit: Stop moving around buttons. I want posting to my story to be the first button I see for priority reasons. Not other social medias."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Loats of buggs like uploading errors. UI/UX of this app needs major improvements like scrolling through chats and searching for spesific word or date. Also, stories needs to be more efficient and user friendly for creative people. Constantly have to work around to find a solution. Also, layering elements is still not on android!!üò±"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very good app for stress relief and mindfulness. But I want to give suggestion to Meta page that If I want to see the reel which I saw in previous days and it is not saved, why don't the instagram page can develop history based option which we can see same reels again currently."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. My previous account was deleted bc of a stupid issue which wasn't solved, I lost 29 important posts. But apart from all that, the app is great, the chatting and the reels are all really good. Pretty much similar to Face book but some settings like the close friends one is absolutely genius."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Would have given it a five if my stuff was reaching people like it's supposed to certainly not a lack of effort on my part. Not only is my page verified but we still seem to have my location set up in Virginia and I live in New York that doesn't make any sense either. Also another thing I've already rated you guys and I keep getting notifications while on the app to rate you why does that keep happening. I'm also paying for ads so I wish my views and profile visits would be distributed correctly
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's wrong with Instagram these days.When I posted a video on the story, suddenly the story took a long time to load and couldn't upload it, the problem was I had to delete it so I could re-upload it, but I didn't have a backup because I uploaded it directly to the story without saving it first. I'm afraid that if I want to upload something to a story, I have to save it on my cellphone first. Then when I uploaded it to the story, suddenly there was no trace of it in the 'archive'"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Constant blocks when tagging friends. Now I can't even get to my help menu to let Instagram know that sending me a notice that two comments have been removed is causing a major glitch where I can get to my normal page it just keeps sending back to the warning. I'd really like to know how tagging a couple of friends goes against community standards. I'd tell people it's not worth the hassle. It's just progressively got worse.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Posts and reels must be at least shared to all the followers. Also this is a place for creators. It seems that trending audios are pushed more easily than a different new one. I think background audio should bot be a criteria for pushing the video. This would temt creators to use existing trending audios whereas there could be a possibility for a better creation..
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am having a similar issue as I am watching reels that the progress load bar disappears, which makes it no longer for me to skip forward, I have to go outside the video and come back in. The reels that would replay by themselves will skip to the next video without me doing it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please sort the reels out. Just fit the photo/video to the screen so it makes it flow a lot easier. We're not all videophotographers. This app is for everyone not influencers who have all the time in the world to create masterpieces.

Everything was working just fine why the sudden change?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Quit updating and changing things that don't need to be changed. Why give us to mute buttons for reelz just to take them away and replace it with that god awful pause button like with Facebook. Worse design choice I've seen, every time from y'all. Smh.

Whenever reacts to story it's ask me to update the app which is already up to date. I see people are live but when I go to see live they are not because they where live much time ago. Really this is disgusting.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"albeit there might be some issue on content recommendations being clearly randomized sometimes which means i had to cache reset every few weeks, i'd say instagram is literally one of the best social media out there, why? quite simple, my internet is absolutely horrenduous, a little ping spike and i'm done from almost any internet. But in instagram, even in the worst of rains, instagram somehow works fine as if i'm living in Japan. Truly an instagram moment."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My id isn't working properly,There is no poll option in my chat if someone send it to me it shows message unavailable. I can't add location to stories when i tap on location my story turn black.I report several times but there is no response from your side. I hope you can resolve this issue as soon as possible.There is no video call option available in chats.Although app was quite good that's why I'm giving 1 stars."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever I wanted to give it a 0 star rating but I cannot what kind of joke is this it's always crashing the app most of the time I open the app it starts glitching I can't upload any photos or videos too even if I try it always in the middle of the process and it never ends unless I delete the app and install it back and what the hell is wrong with songs why are they only unavailable only for my account?? Please fix this asap !!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You only get one shot at editing your reel now. If you save a draft then open it you can only edit your cover. Don't know why they changed it. I enjoyed being able to save a work in progress for later then pick up where I left off later on.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many issues main one being that when I try to make a post it blacks out my pictures or half of my pictures so I can even post anything and when it doesnt do that when I am able to upload them it says theres an error posting. whats the point if I cant even use it it also doesnt actually save my drafts so I usually have to restart a post over and over
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Garbage the worst app as a new user I have ever tried to use. All frills but can't do the basics. Absolute trash. Don't waste your time unless you're a masochist. Allows you to post the same video 10 times then says there's a 10 post maximum. Never mind I was trying to post different vids. programmers should be shot. Round up the whole software development team and drown them in a sceptic tank. Not even joking. If you're a new user, just uninstall the app right now. Save yourself the aggravation"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Watching a video. Make the video full screen. Screen goes black in the middle of video due to inactivity. Tap screen. Video is gone. Have to start 4 minute video over. No fast forward feature. Leave a review. Add fast-forward for videos Keep screen alive when watching videos
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a 144Hz display. My adaptive refresh rate is turned ON. 1 month before, everything was fine. But from past 10-15 days, the screen is very laggy. I think adaptive refresh rate is not working fine with this app. I'm using other apps, they work just fine with adaptive refresh rate."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My experience with Instagram was good but now I'm facing issues like my messages deliver too much late even though my internet connection is perfectly fine. It's very annoying like someone is talking to you and then you suddenly ghost . Please fix this issue as soon as possible. Idk but this app is getting worse day by day . I tried reinstalled the app but my DMs are still not working :/
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"REALLY SICK OF MY COMMENTS BEING AUTOMATICALLY FLAGGED AS SPAM ON INSTA WHEN THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT. Now there's not even an option to request review, which there was before. Your technology isn't working properly. On the other hand, I've also reported some actual vile instances of hate speech and exploitation material though, which doesn't get removed, even when supposedly having being manually reviewed. This is totally cooked. Deleting app, tired of Meta anyway, & this is a good prompt."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In all seriousness this site used to be banging and over all its one of the better social sites in terms of what you can do, I use it more than most but the constant crashing, bugs, mass outages and glitches is acc getting ridiculous now, like cmon tiktok, snapchat youtube even Facebook that no one uses anymore don't have nearly the amount of problems Insta seems to have. One of the biggest social media's yet its the one that stops working the most"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The pinning option is full of bugs. I cant pin anything to my reels grid. Every time it says your reel has been pinned and then nothing changes. tried pinning other reels but it was the same. I have reported this many times in the app and still no fix. Not a good support üëé
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"These past updates have made the app virtually useless. I can't post to my story, I can't see other's stories, trying to fast forward on reels freezes everything, and I constantly get a ""Couldn't refresh feed"" message every time I open the app. Absolute dog water."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Privacy concern: Contacts exclusive to whatsapp are showing as suggested and this app has no permissions enabled. The send to list is messed up, with a completely random order that keeps changing. All Facebook apps are terrible, it was just a matter of time before this one was Ruined. Facebook developers, you are terrible!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With every update, the app gets worse. With today's update, I can no longer skip reels or directly share reels with my followers. I have to manually enter their name every time I wanna share with them. A pop-up menu used to appear whenever I hit the share button, it no longer exists."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lags. Stops playing reels randomly. Terrible UI. Sound button on reels, automatic scroll after a reel has played once, scrolls so that the next reel is in full view so cannot scroll in the middle of two reels so can't read big captions, and many other terrible features. Also randomly crashes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My instagram this morning has just completely stopped working nothing loads nor sends and when I went online to look for help nothing worked I have deleted and reinstalled the app cleared the cache and data and tried to re-log in however now it just comes up with a different error message stating problems on their end and to try again which does not change no matter how many times I try to log back in.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have met with so many bugs. Sometimes i cannot even see what's written because of the bug. Nothing shows. Very slow loading. My story aren't going clear. Blurry. Loading issues. Black and white colour issues with captions.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time I attempt to log in to the Instagram app on my mobile device, I encounter an error message that states, ""Sorry, there was a problem in your request."" This issue has persisted consistently, and despite various attempts to troubleshoot on my end, I have been unable to resolve it. Although it's working in other mobile phone. Everytime I've to change my password, use gmail to recover account than use two factor authentication apps, why is it happening??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Awful UI. Full of bugs. App always changes for the worse. Discovering new content or being discovered as a small artist or business is next to impossible due to the garbage algorithm. only negative experiences with the app for the past 5 years.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix your endless scroll in following & dm list, it keeps reloading first page over and over again. Its been like that for so long. And theres a new bug now where you cant move the reels' timestamp, if you try to move it, it will just break the video and got stuck."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recent bugs that have gone uncorrected for over a week or so. no longer able to seek through any video content without the app crashing. If this continues to be the case I'll probably uninstall and move onto something else.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think last update was better than the recent one. During the previous update after clicking on the reels it was pausing and separate mute option was visible on the right top corner. But in the recent update it came back to the mute after clicking and for pausing long continuous press on screen.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Advancing through reels is no longer working. I seldom look at an entire reel. I look at the beginning, then scroll right to see the result. I hope this is a glith and not intentional. If it remains this way, I will no longer watch reels. This is a waste of time."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its has been working fine for a couple of yrs. But today, it wont work suddenly, wont refresh my profile. I can see my own posts. Cant add music to the posts. It suddenly stopped working even after i updated it, restarted the phone, the issue still persists. please resolve ASAP!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it keeps kicking me out. Everytime i tried to log back in, everytime i tried to make highlights it doesn't have many options and also my followers doesn't increase when i follow someone's account and it doesn't appear on my account. This is ridiculous. Pls fix this mess insta. Fix all those bugs. And i won't change my review until it's all fixed up"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is not functioning properly. Sone of the features are hardly visible... for example the ""follow"" button is now appearing like a white button. Photos or videos I'm saving are not showing up anywhere on the device."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy watching content about photography, cars, aviation, guns, and all kinds of other cool things. The algorithm is an absolute dumpster fire. Instead of getting the usual things I enjoy watching, I get videos of people getting killed in some horrific manor or I get a bunch of naked women or, worst of all... political propaganda. There is that, plus if you comment ""shoot"" or ""gun,"" your comment can get you banned. Their guidelines are wack as hell, and their algorithms are obnoxious."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dark mode for my samsung s9+ is horrible (background will constantly revert to white blocks.. but text stays white so you can't read anything etc), a bunch of functions (like ""posts I've liked"") are hard to find/poorly organized. I love IG itself but this app needs work..... as usual. Political content automatically turned off."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm having trouble logging in to my other account. The options are not even working, especially the SMS login code and Facebook access they keep erroring, and I didn't receive a text code. When I try to get support and do a video selfi to confirm my identity, it wasn't accepted, and it keeps on rejecting my video selfies. I didn't know where I could get the backcode, so I can't log in to my account for months"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Another social networking app. I find Instagram slightly complex when it comes to use & navigation. Add friends, comment, like/unlike, stories & more. Similar to it's original predecessor Facebook only seems to have an extra level of privacy, & content is more so user defined or customised."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What is happening. I wanted to make a new account so I can post edits and after I finished making the account a white screen would pop up and close by itself and would say we limit smth idk. It was nearly impossible to sign out Edit: I barely managed to switch accounts by double clicking the pfp icon rapidly, when there wasn't the white screen (every 0.6 seconds) there would be the notification pop up. If you wanna make a new account be careful not to lose the other ones in the process."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Some functions have to be improved! Mobile app always crops your images to another aspect ratio unlike the webpage! Very unclear how to use certain functions such as reply to comments in a DM or not letting your posts sorted into some kind of folders (you can only put stories into story highlights). There's lots of work to do!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't understand why this app gives us the option to snooze suggested posts on our feed for 30 days, when it does nothing and I'm still getting them, even with the setting re-enabled. My Instagram is up to date too, so this doesn't make any sense. Seems pretty counterintuitive to me üòï"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are a couple of issues with the Instagram app. Firstly, I can't drag the video forward using the progress bar; it disappears when I try. Secondly, I'm receiving friend suggestions in the notification section even when there are no actual notifications. Please address these problems."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update- i can use it as intended except for it freezing most of the time when i try to share a story. Which means i have to restart the app and probably not find the story again Wont let me comment, but it says my account is normal. No limitations,no warnings,etc. I tried reporting it to get help, but there has been no response. I think im just gonna delete my account at this point. I used to love this app. Went from 5 to a 1 star in a few days"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It slows down much. Righ after i make a post, my wifi goes off and it only happens with instagram. My phone is clear. Just spent about 9 hours clearing everything and updating antiviruses. And ot still slowsdown on different devices. Getting a bit better though."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As an android user, it's very frustrating uploading multiple pics in a post. The editing and fit of the photos are always out of the frame. That's the only complaint I have. Otherwise, app is good."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Since the last app update on my Google Pixel 6A the Instagram videos have started stuttering and full of lags when I use Bluetooth headphones. When I disconnect them the videos play just fine. This doesn't happen with any other social media or video streaming app.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Looks like they have not written enough tests at Instagram: you can drag and zoom your photos as good as you want, but when you post them, all adjustments are lost. This used to work better a few weeks ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I got logged out randomly today from all of my accounts and can no longer log back in. I checked my email and nothing changed with my account. I can still log in on my browser. This app is broken. Update. Day 2 of not being able to log in. This might finally be the push I needed to quit this app for good.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app has major issues while editing reels. I edited a reel successfully with the text to speech feature only to find that the text somehow got overlapped and all the text is spoken at once. I did this two times wasting my time and was frustrated.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible usability, switching to web. Resets new posts unless they are published. Cannot find saved drafts. Always goes to Recent, forcing me to scroll through thousands of WhatsApp pictures. Sometimes an 'unknown' error occurs - hello, this is 21st century!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have it, but ONE thing keeps me from using it... i have to tell it NOT to crop my picture to square when i post a photo. Maybe there's a quick fix, but an app that touts bein primarily for photos shouldn't edit mine by default when i post it. I shouldn't have to tell it to post all of my photo. As a semi-professional, to me that's like a slap in the face."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Y'all ruined the app can't fast forward or rewind videos anymore it's like what did y'all do it's frustrating I literally just left Instagram after trying all day to watch all kinds of videos and it just don't allow you to fast forward or rewind it just literally freezes up and I have to exit the app
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,New app update can't use photos or videos from my SD card. That is where all my videos are stored. Cannot make anymore Reels or stories. App is useless to me now. ****New update fixed my Instagram SD card access problem. It works great now. Thank you so very much.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Latest update made the issue with the feed refreshing much worse. It's constantly refreshing when scrolling and clicking out of the app (not closing it). Very annoying and can't keep up with posts. Also routinely shows posts that are 4 - 5 days old & videos are buggy/freezing.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Now there is a lot of bugs in Instagram. While watching the reels it's getting stopped, while seeing the story it's showing entire black screen and sometimes it gets stopped for no reason. I suggest you to improve the quality of your developers. As a developer I have a respect to meta team, now it's getting down."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't see the appeal. All I see are ads and posts I don't want to see, with no way to stop it. Looked at 1 image of Y? Here's a million more, forever. Regardless of you follow 100's of accts about X, like X images, etc - You're getting Y. Open app, Ads, close app. Repeat. Use it for business use; it's not a social network anymore it's just ads"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Since I downloaded this app I'm having problems. Stops refreshing or working every once in a while. In addition to this keeps asking me to add my birthday date, but if I don't want to do it I can't access to my account. My solution is keep uninstalling and downloading again and again, every time it doesn't work. Such a poor app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app needs an update. Videos from a carousel (multiple post- post) that I click on shows a black screen which causes me to swipe left then back to the video so it can play. Another issue I'm having is the slider at the bottom of videos. Anytime I try to fast forward or rewind a video using the slide bar at the bottom, it causes the video to freeze. I've already unistalled and reinstalled the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This platform is among the ones with the most awful programming in history. The algorithm is a mess, I tell it a million times that I am not interested in certain types of content, that I'm uncomfortable even, and it keeps forcefeeding me with that. Also, add another ""not interested"" option: I don't even speak the language. I get so many posts in languages I don't speak, it's beyond annoying and ridiculous. And do something about the bots for once, it's unbearable"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall I really appreciate about the features and all the stuff included in this version but kindly being an Instagram addict I request your team to fix the issue of whenever the user goes offline kindly please it shows like they are online for 7 minutes please fix these because of this issue I got more trust issues with my loved ones üôè it's an humble request from my side by the way thanks for such a great platform ‚ú®üíù...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have some suggestions for the developers of Instagram app who's job is to enhance certain basic features, 1. Please put a sort and filter option in saved posts /reels just how it is in the ""liked posts"" , it makes user's life easierrr. 2. Bring back the ""share comment"" option. 3. Please make a feature to copy the comment as well (this is very useful when trying to copy and paste links)."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well, this is the most creepiest app on my phone. Whatever i search on my browser or any 3rd party shopping app, for some reason, Meta/Insta knows about it even though it should not know what I'm searching on other apps and then shows similar ads on Instagram. I wonder what else your app is capable of doing even though, I've not given any permission to it in the settings. I would just stop using all your apps because each time the above things happen, I feel my privacy is breached. Dangerous!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible customer support. I have an account that's been malfunctioning for months now. It won't accept my email and returns me to the same login page over and over again. I've tried sourcing some assistance from ANYWHERE, be it their email or the in-built bug report system, but have received complete radio silence on all fronts."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I think Instagram should help to add pictures after posting cuz' someone will forget to add some pictures while posting the pictures.. so even after posting instagram should bring an editing option so we can add extra pictures and with delete option..I hope they'll bring up this feature soon.. pls bring that feature soon..
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Changing to one star. For MONTHS there is a bug after bug with each update. It's getting ridiculous. It is always something in regards to reels. And now they don't even work, app just crashes when you open any reel. AWESOME JOB GUYS"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""What the hell now"" is all I can say. The comment, like, and share buttons all pause the video. They will eventually work if I spend a few minutes tapping them like a crackhead looking for a rock, or they will somehow swipe right and take me to the videos page. This used to be such a solid app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Title: Disappointing Instagram Experience My recent experience with Instagram has been frustrating. I can't like reels or other people's posts without encountering notifications about guidelines and privacy policies. The inability to comment or like comments further limits my engagement.

The new features that allow you to add music to your profiles and likes notes isnt available and there's no place for me to update it on the app. My friends (from the same city) have this feature on there acciunt but I don't.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app. 1 out of every 4 posts is people I follow. All others are adds and suggestions. It says you can block an add, it doesn't. It will be right back there next time. Worse still, it will constantly block the ability to post a comment. It allows 1 then blocks me for a week before repeating the process if I have the nerve to post a second comment. If I could it would get zero stars."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like it my one complaint off the top of my head is how easy it is to accidentally call someone, it happens a lot because it's just one button idk maybe they could fix that or not either way its a good app. Edit: over time my opinion has changed. Very easy to get hacked, happens A LOT. Bad costumer service I, nor did my friends get any help. Also glitchy as hell, and constantly won't let me do the simplest of tasks."

I tested a new post to see what would happen. The post appeared on the app but not on the same account online. This is not working for me at all."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I always thought that top apps have best user support & top developers but it isn't true.

Over complicated for no reason it's a video sharing site that's makes it difficult and unfun to share videos. Need I say more.

I don't like how it switches stories I'm reading if I close my screen or switch apps (must be intentional) Theory is to maximize usage hours. By trying to find it again. Minor stress released so you need more dopamine to fix it was probably researched by meta. Another issue is The chronic flagging for bs claims & no way to disput becoming increasingly frequent. Needless to say I sold all my Meta stks

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The haptic vibration whenever liking a comment is annoying, but can't be turned off. Scrolling through reels is also super-sensitive now, the screen constantly wants to swipe sideways instead of scrolling down. On that same screen, it's also near-impossible to tap the comments perfectly enough to open them."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've been using Instagram since 2020 . For these years everything was absolutely fine and normal. But after the recent update I'm facing problems. The app crashes continuously for 2/3 days. At first I thought this might be a problem of my phone storage but I can see now the problem is with the app only. So please solve this problem ASAP.

Anyhow, I AM irritated by how your feed refreshes automatically, losing where you are in the app. Stop that! (And lastly, as a sidenote, I get that social media is a competitive market, but I'm on IG because I like this specific app - not because I want it to be the new TikTok.)"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall this app is good. But I have one suggestion: in the profile page of chats, can u add functionality for continous reels to be shown as per the chat history, Just like normally it shows for profile. As its hectic and cumbersome to watch one reels at a time, and go back again in the chat history."

And I have to say that I really tried to like Tiktok and Threads, but in the end, I did not. TicTok seems to be hypnoctic mindlessness, and Threads is just boring.

Due to this error that is due to their app I get a notification Telling me I was in the wrong for posting multiple times. It is ridiculous. As I have seen posts with violence, Fake news, And sexual content. Why are these posts still up? Seems to me Instagram selects who they want to pick on and ignores what should be noticed.

When typing on Instagram the keyboard will duplicate the first letter of the first word so I'll type out a word for example ""where"" and it will change to ""Wwhere"" ... why? Also, let's say you miss a word in the middle of your sentence and you click to add it, every letter you click will move the cursor back to the end of the comment. It is very infuriating and only happens on Instagram, no other app. Yes I have tried all the usual steps. Cache, Logging out, etc."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram as a platform is good, set up in a way that removes a lot of the toxicity you encounter on Facebook. However, as others have said updates are continually causing issues. Right now I'm unable to remove links in my bio. Also, they're pushing Threads *SO* hard, and it's a useless platform that just shows you people you're already following. Stop pushing it. You'll get better reviews and therefore more (loyal) users when you stop breaking your own app each you 'update' it. Do a better job."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Good grief. This app is STILL buggy. The stories continue to play even when the phone is not using the app. The original audio will play over new audio that you want to use if you change your mind about the other.

For every new bug that appears, they make an unnecessary change, instead of focusing on the problems, they keep changing other things that no one asked for! Right now, I can't like any posts, follow anyone, or comment on anything. It's been happening for a while, and not only to me. I have a lot friends tell me they have the same problem.

It claims I should be able to access the app but I can't do anything or see anything. I can't even see my own posts. Please fix I used to share my art on here and I'm scared it might all be gone now.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As of yesterday, I am no longer able to post anything. I've tried to contact support by shaking my phone to no avail, it's as if they don't even look at the bug reports and diagnostics I send them. Horrible app, and extremely buggy."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Instagram for soo long, the app is nice but there is two fatal things that disturb me and I really don't like it. The first one is when you upload a picture or a video into your story, the picture's or the video's quality become worse. The second one is the reels algortihm, my page used to filled with the things I intrest the most and the things I like but now the reels and the page filled with people creating nonsense content. I tried everything but it didn't work. Please fix it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's disappointing to note the absence of a reel bonus feature on Instagram. Introducing such a feature could significantly enhance user engagement and encourage more content creation on the platform. By incentivizing the use of reels, Instagram could foster a more dynamic and active community of creators and viewers. Implementing a reel bonus would not only enrich the user experience but also contribute to the platform's growth and popularity so please think about it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am irritated when someone sends me a photo that doesn't stay in chat, and it bugs out.

Can log on easily via laptop and phone but not the app. Contacting customer services us a joke as there is none and if you get lucky they will be incompetent at best. Instagram has become totally useless since taken over by Facebook/meta, whatever you want to call yourself it still = useless"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram at it again with breaking all features that make it a good app. Haven't updated it fearing what damage they'll do next. The last one removed the progress bar thing for reels, you can't hide the description box for reels anymore, hid all share lists so you can't share posts/reels with people. Honestly idk why the devs hate this app so much. Like adding ads i can understand, money hungry corpos need money... But why break good features?? Dangit I wish I can go back to the older versions."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So lately I haven't been able to follow anyone back after the last few updates. It hasn't said anything about me having Max following or anything it just shows that people followed me and I try to follow them back and it shows I'm following them but when I get off the app and I get back onto the app in my notifications it shows that I'm not following them and I keep on trying to follow them over and over and nothing's working. I refreshed the app and reinstalled it. Once again nothing's working

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've lowered down this rating because I can't determine if I've been shadow banned or my content is purposefully be blocked by some entity. My experience overall is somewhat good. The algorithm needs to stop playing favorites when it comes to certain users. If you want a better rating then give me a better experience with more followers and exposure on explore. Fair advice enough for you.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hi I'm a person who loves to use Instagram but recently I've had more issues considering the fact that yall refuse to let me use my account and logged me out randomly. I was just on it and it said error and logged me out. Then I can log in do to the ridiculous codes but I still provided the recovery codes and it did not work. I have emailed support and have not gotten a response. I have tried multiple ways to retrieve my account going to both the help center and support. 0 stars if I could.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had Instagram for almost 10 years. Used to be a pretty solid way to share photography. Now, it's just an advertising and data collection service. Every third post is an ad‚Äîoften a scam‚Äîand in between those are more and more ""suggested"" posts and the ""promoted"" ones users have paid to be seen. Constant badgering to join Threads. Hashtags don't work anymore. It's becoming another sad casualty of late stage capitalism."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram for me is often glitchy and won't post photos well. Reals have completely taken over now. There is a toxic atmospher the app clearly pushes even when you try to just keep to a specific type of content (for me art). I've tried programming the algorithm to give me art only but it's been subpar at best. For your own sanity NEVER read comments on Instagram even if it's for something innocent. Instagram loves Tic Tok like content. If I wanted tic Tok I would have gotten that app.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great and all but whenever I try to put a story using the music, it always says ""this music is currently unavailable"". If this is a problem of my phone, please let me know. And if its not, then please try to fix it. Thank you!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall it's a good app, but my accounts keep getting compromised and I don't know why, the app says I used a software that makes me have more followers and likes but I don't, there has to be another way to verify or change the password of my account, cause sometimes I forget them, and then it asks for my old password so I can change it, but then when I click ""forgot password"" before I enter my email it immediately sends me back to the ""change password"" page, please add something useful Insta."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great fun . New to this app but loving finding people who I actually am friends with in real life on here and other I'm familiar with and support online elsewhere too. Easy to learn the basics of how to use and even more fun getting to know how to tweak options on the app to my preferences and begin to gain some fun traction with cool people on here. Way more fun and more normal than tic tok Thanks you.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I never write reviews. However, like on Facebook, I have to do this. Instagram's algorithm has become such a pain that even the most polite, kind and loving comments I put up are immediately taken down by Instagram for no apparent reason.

The timeline also shows me my own posts constantly as if recommending them to me. Also, I wish I could just MUTE users, and it would actually work.

Please create an option for public pages to set certain posts and stories to private, for followers only. Some of us may want to make more connections in this world but do not want to create a new public account, and want to maintain the account's posts that are private.

I'm going to stop use this app if I see people of older group this platform. Make the interface more hard and difficult to operate. Even we have to figure out how to use it, make it that hard!! We got plenty of application to which we can move."

A lot of people actually LOVED the guides. It helped a lot of people. But you guys took them away. 2. Videos. Before some people will post 1-3 minutes videos and it'll be good. But now, those video posts turn into reels. It doesn't look right. And just other things. IG should have a whole day or week, where people can say what they dislike or like about IG.

So if you don't know if your account gets deleted you just have to live with the anxiety that you could lose access to it any minute. What's also infuriating is randomly getting notifications for comment removal because ""of suspected spam"" may as well throw the whole app into the abyss"

Why would anyone ""enjoy"" this is beyond me, but keep it tf away from me. My sensitivity settings are ""normal"" (middle option)."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Within the past few months the app has been horrible. Multiple comments I've made were immediately labeled as spam and blocked from being posted when they didn't violate any of their policies or include solicitation. I've been blocked from commenting on multiple occasions but all it says is that they'll limit certain functions for the sake of their community. What? It also constantly glitches or freezes randomly. I've reached out to them about it before and gotten no response.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like it to post photos but your algorithms have gone downhill and follower engagement is in the trash. If you just want a place to post photos for yourself, it works. If you want others to see your photos, this does not work. I had 100x more engagement 4+ years ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Currently facing many technical problems. The biggest being the censorship of my account and inability to reach my own followers. I now reach between 100-200 of my fans per post which happened in the span of a few updates on the app when on average I was reaching at least 1k-1.5k per post. The inability to point out these algorithm errors to Instagram and actually communicate with someone is a travesty in and of itself. Livelihoods are being destroyed without any form of recourse.

I have a limited number of people who's stories I watch and this update really annoys me. I already accidentally followed unfamiliar people several times because of this garbage. So I had to find them in my list to unsubscribe. It looks like Instagram is already a dead horse. It started dying when they bought it, and now they finished it. Do anybody have any idea, what social network to use now instead of this?"

Also, on the homepage, half of the posts I'm scrolling through aren't even people I follow. It's either ads or a bunch of suggestions (which is curated to me, so not as bad, but at least let me see the people I'm actually following first). They don't even notify me anymore for the people I do want notifications from when they post."

It's been months now since I have this issue. Is it ever going to be fixed? Or am I being punished for bad behaviour here? I have no issue loging into my iPhones or iOS devices, but apparently that's not the case for Android. P.S: This used to be such a great app for photographers until Zuckie got his hands on it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Instagram. It's really helps kill off time and also interact with so many people. Plus, the reminders it has to get off the app and take a break have really helped regulate the amount of time I spend on the app"

It was much easier to connect with the same like people back then than it is now. I believe you have to put in a ton of time, kinda like a second job kinda time, which I just don't have, and if I did have more time I'm not so sure that I would still put that kinda effort in. There is a lot of life to live, and it's better for me to live it as freely as possible. SM is not as social anymore."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a great app but went down a horrible path. Everything needs to be a reel now, which doesn't even function properly. Normal harmless comments get taken down regularly for spam, but actual bot comments are under every post. The amount of hate you can find, inform of comments but also posts, and no matter how often you try to block the accounts and say you're not interested, it keeps showing up. There is also not a proper support, idk why."

Not only did they not help me in recovering my account but did not even disable the account. Meanwhile the hacker kept using my account and misleading my followers while engaging in identity theft. No efforts have been made to assist me so I am quite disappointed.

Not everyone has unlimited phone data to play with. Not everyone owns a phone that can actually handle streaming. The messaging system is screwed up as all getup. I mean, when I am in FB, I go to see comments needs Instagram for that. Messages - You need to be in Instagram to see this type of message. Then I get into Instagram, and it is a goofy message. Just a mess."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They've changed the app so you can't see recent posts. That means the only content I can see is from irrelevant influencers who posted days ago and it rarely changes. I have no reason to use this if I'm unable to browse the content I want because they're trying to force feed me sponsored content

It is no longer a photo sharing app, I miss the times where I would just follow my friends and see their posts. Now its becoming a habbit of doom scrolling (endlessly scrolling for content).

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taking out the festure of being able to see new posts in hashtags was a really bad decision. Each update seems like it only makes the app worst and adds things nobody asked for. Especially now with how they took off the tags tab and integrated it with the main feed tab. It's awful. There's no way to see newer posts, essentially killing niche tag posts by filling the top of the page with years old content. Even popular tags it's the exact same, but it hurts smaller tags more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So you can't see the full extent of your comments as you write them due to the text box being so small, and you STILL can't edit your comment after posting because for some reason the software designers for ig think that feature is unnecessary even though EVERY other social media platform has it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use Instagram often for communication & doom scrolling, but there's nothing very notable about this app. It is more about what's popular. You're encouraged to post more, but since you can only see the popular posts, it's difficult to gain traction. It feels mundane at times, just rehashing the same videos over and over again, getting banned for the dumbest thing when this app is littered with gore and aggression that seems to have no end"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think more should be done to protect people from hacking, i dont understand how people can hack an account, steal someones savings yet we get banned for offering our friends our phone number on a public post but wanting to provide the number by inbox. Other than things like that, its a great app for keeping in touch and learning new things, security is just a bit untrusting with regards to hacking"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fun fact! Instagram will sometimes disable some of your functionality without telling you. I recently discovered that people are no longer able to follow my account even though I supposedly have access to all features.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm extremely frustrated with Instagram for constantly removing my comments. Due to the platform's limited comment space, I often compose my comments elsewhere and then copy-paste them onto Instagram. However, Instagram flags this as spamming, which is incredibly frustrating.

And another thing: Why am I barred when following accounts? I follow less than 3,000 accounts and according to the settings, I'm able to use all the features that you offer yet I cannot follow anyone, I get a notice telling me so to prevent misuse."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I loved Instagram because of photography and the connections formed with others. I tolerated the bad UI changes, and reels integration. But what I can't stand is random Threads posts on my feed from xenophobic and hateful people, who get boosted by other like minded individuals because of how engagement feeds the algorithm. It's a terrible design. Threads was supposed to be better than Twitter. Keep Threads feeds and Instagram posts seperate."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WARNING: Don't update ... once updated you can't await the next update to resolve some new bugs. Some tags seem to be removed randomly from previous posts ... some posts weren't shown as tagged even though tagged persons didn't remove their tags and just wanted to keep being tagged. A reel took too long to start playing now - and that's NOT a network issue.

My app is up to date, my use less data is off, I have no account restrictions...doesn't make any sense. I'm about to switch to tik tok full time because this is ridiculous and should be fixed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Certainly an app most people enjoy, including me, but the frequent changes to the menu and the inability to permanently disable certain ads, including but not limited to the incessant Threads invites, are truly annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App animations are ridiculously slow. If I back out of a DM it does this dramatic slow PowerPoint-like screen wipe that takes like over a second and it's really clunky looking and annoying. How do I make it stop?
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Here I am again, writing ANOTHER review. I don't know how many times a day you expect someone to 'verify' themselves when using a 3rd party app. I get the first time, maybe the second. But not everytime guys. This consistent logging out and verifying is ridiculous. You're not a bank so there's definitely no need for this endless hoop jumping just to look at your own account. You MUST do better guys. Instagram is being left behind as far as social media is concerned."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app needs some serious maintenance, everywhere. It's so glitchy and annoying omfl. The devs need to employ some people to work on general quality of life features. Firstly, DMs don't even show up sometimes until days later or I refresh 5 times. Great for business that. Secondly, I post stories and add them to my highlights only to find surpriiise insta never added it to the highlight. And for some reason they can't be found in my stories archive either. Thirdly, this is basically TikTok now"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, The whole application itself is full of hackers. The company itself hacks you and invades everyones privacy. It makes me and others very uncomfortable. Instagram is basically in debt since they technically have photos of me. If it's not the opposite gender of hackers to be weird. Than the same gender trying to say, ""I was with that person first"" or some lies. It's a bunch a weird people with money, Weird drug addicts, Or people that use people. Meeting some new people is neat though."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's works fine but sometimes it shows waiting for network for certain reels and posts. When trying to switch between two accounts it turns blue and white and gets blurred. Pls do something abt it.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How a company as big as Instagram can produce an app with sooooo many soooo obvious bugs, and not fix them for months (!!!) is beyond me. Update: every new update brings new bugs. Now it's (among other things) reaction emojis being switched around. Unbelievable. What a disgrace. Going down to one star for sheer laziness in quality control on Meta's part."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I comment in a page with longer words it recognize as spam, then I received comment removed notification, why? I don't comment sensitively, it don't have any repeal option for me. After I tap return to main page, the notification keep popping out and not allow me to use IG anymore, I must keep killing app several time until it gone normal, and next time it keep recognize my every single words as spam, what the hell? very disappointed experience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I liked the app, but suddenly it stopped letting me into it. I've restarted my phone, and still,the app is not working. Every time I try opening the app it freezes my screen and makes my phone glitch up."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is overall good but some people like me don't have the notes feature in their account. I report it so many times but don't have any response in return. Too frustrated because of this . If you are unable to provide your simple features to everyone then please don't launch them !
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When is Instagram ever going to change it's format to allow full screen aspect ratio for photos? Forcing people to clip the standard size of all photos to fit ig is ridiculous. Get with the times already.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Won't allow me to login, nor even perform the forget password & create new account options.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"God awful moderation. You can literally state a factual statement, and if it gets reported or ""flags the correct terms,"" it'll be removed regardless of what it says with no way of repealing. Eventually resulting in account limits or termination. An example is ""wedding photos are pointless"" and that got removed for ""trying to receive fake likes"" tf does that even mean."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very pathetic experience with the reels uploading. Every time I failed in uploading reels from the Instagram mobile application. Although I have updated it but still not working. Very disappointed
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate this app It keeps asking to add a new username or to type a new confirmation code or whatever multiple times after already doing it, and it keeps taking me back to the same place over and over again.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't able to complete the two remaining steps for my professional account on Instagram. It's so annoying and ridiculous.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I was going through the reelsvand wanted to add it on my story but as a user experience finding the option is adding extra work in it. Also as User interface present icons aren't visible. Please look into it #instagramteam

I thankfully was able to log back in, but I have no idea what I did wrong. I got no notification that someone else was trying to log into my account. I rely on this app to communicate with family and friends, so I would appreciate it if anyone would get back to me and let me know how this can not happen in the future??? Apparently, I'm not the only one who's had this issue."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hello Instagram, please stop listening to calls and reading our chat data because if someone feels depressed, you suggest more videos related to depression, even if we talk to someone on phone call, you listen to everything we say And when we open Insta, you get suggestions about what we talked about on the call. And I changed my interest options many times but nothing happened And you are the biggest reason of every man who got depressed. It's totally unfair"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is trash. I just got two strikes for trying to post recovery links for those suffering from addiction. The second was an edit of the same post still trying to get the info out. It said I was trying to deceptivly get views and likes. Maybe I could have helped Someone but profits for the app was more important it seems. Disgusting.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Took forever to get my verification code. Then when I try to follow/ follow people back it is not letting me due to ""limitations"". Will not let me follow more than 50 accounts in over 24 hours since I set up my own account. No support team either is really shady. Looks like both of the issues I have are absolutely rampant with users as well and a lot of the times it never gets fixed. Absolutely ridiculous."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Need to check their algorithms as perfectly innocent posts keep getting tagged as spam. When using music with a single photo the music clip needs to be longer without having to add more photos.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't even skip through the minute long videos like I used to. You can't even scroll to a different video and scroll back to restart the previous video you were watching. This new update is useless. I remixed one of my videos from my PUBLIC account onto my other, I woke up one morning, and it said my original video couldn't be remixed anymore, and they took down my remix on my other account which had almost 1,000 views btw."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app needs a small change for me. Give as an option to change the theme of the chat so we can add whatever picture we like through our device album and change the colour of the texts too to whatever we like. I think it would be a great feature to add to Instagram
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a frustrating application with 0% customer care service. I reported my fianc√©e post by accident, and till now, my issue hasn't been resolved.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like Instagram overall and it's community but the reason I'm giving this a one star is because It logged me out of my actual account and when I try to recover it and try to send a verification code to my email it says it will take a minute and I end up waiting an hour and even though I enter the correct password it continues to say it's not the right password and I have to create a new account.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unusable. Most story functionality doesn't work anymore. In addition, the spam filter is out of control. You can make even the most benign comment but sometimes if you even have a badly placed word - like ""instagram"" -the auto flagging algorithm will remove your comment. No one will ever get back to you about it either. I've just stopped commenting on friends' posts altogether - never know if one ""Good luck!"" comment will be my last. Convinced no actual humans work at this company anymore."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app but I would really like the feature of changing names and being able to scroll in the chat smoothly without taking so long plus I would like it if the searched message didn't only show a few messages after it

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's been a year and they have fixed this stupid bug. There is this moronic idiotic bug that will just choose any comment at random and start spamming me with the 'spam removed' message.

It took me about 50 posts and 3 weeks to figure out why. So for some strange reason. I can post what I want. But if I add a number to my post it's removed IMMEDIATELY. If I spell the number out into a word like nine it's fine. But no matter what the context of the message is or the topic. If I use a actual number like 9. REMOVED FOR SPAM. JOKE.

While I may not be experiencing any issues with the app, others are. While I am providing a positive review, it doesn't alter the fact that people have been complaining about it. The least the company could do is try to assist them; after all, it's your app, and I'm not trying to be disrespectful."

The moderation system is awful, its absolutely hypocritical and punishes certain people for something that you can see 300 other people saying.

I tried all troubleshooting methods and sent several reports to support but no response even after a long time. Would not recommend as an app to communicate."

When you select 'add to story' or 'post' it shows 'error' and you have to re-do it and hope it will be successful (which usually it isn't and you have to reset your device) The app is amazing, just a few bugs.ü™≤ ü©∑üå∏"

Despite updating, I can only add text and song notes, missing out on voice and video notes. Wondering if this is an Android issue or others have experienced it too?

The app constantly freezes as I'm trying to make reels. And, the Save Draft button doesn't work anymore, I have to back out and hope it saved. Sometimes it doesn't save and it gives me another error message. Very frustrating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was working fine until just recently, when they seemed to have changed the set up when you want to add photos as posts or stories. Hitting the plus button doesn't bring up the most recent photos I've taken, even a day later, even searching through the different album options which don't align with my actual photo album on my phone. I have to go to my photo album, and share from there to Insta, which is a roundabout way of doing it. What have you done to the app?!?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Says 'Error' when tryg to post photos to my story. When they do work, story quality of photos is absolutely terible even though I have ""Upload at highest quality"" turned on.

When I lock my phone while I'm on the app audio from videos won't stop playing. Still has this audio bug, which I added to my review in January."

They just won't show up, but I'll see them on my notifs. Can't view individual photos on one of my accounts, but they're visible on my profile page. Drafts for posts (NOT REELS) won't show up. Some audios will be perfectly synced while editing, but will end up not matching after posting. It's very frustrating. Please fix. This is insane."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is my go to for social media. However, it has been pretty damn annoying the past few months. It has so many glitches. Sometimes when you take a vide the screen goes black or it crashes. It sends your stories to people from your messages when you go to add a story. When making reels it constantly erases the audio so I have to go back and add it and then it will tell me the audio os unavailable when it let me add it before. Can we please fix these issues?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recent updates have so many bugs. 1) Instagram no longer can see any photos or videos on my SD card, only internal memory. 2) Only way I can add a story is by going to my profile and clicking the + at the top. The + on the main feed screen results in an error. 3) I no longer have the ability to schedule posts. I used to have it, now it's gone. This is HUGE for a small business who needs to regularly post content. Please fix these issues ASAP! Android user if that makes a difference."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how the feed automatically scrolls to the next post when I'm trying to read a caption. The only way around it is to go to the posters profile, search for that video, and read it from there. PITA. Also don't care for all the suggested content. I never see any content from the accounts I actually follow. It's just continuous suggested content and ads, one after the other. Maybe 10 posts down & finally I come across one from someone I follow. Annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been years but it still has same glitchs, it doesn't work smoothly, I have good network, but I can't refresh the dm page, or feed right now and it happened many times before.

I don't know if this comment will effect it or not, but I would like you to fix it."

I hope that this problem will be fixed because it's my most fave thing to use. Also, on the albums when we're going to add pictures, is it possible to add an option so that it could be cropped out based on what size we want it to be? Because it's quite troublesome to crop it in the camera/photos app then we need to open insta again. Thank you!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Finally managed to post something after months. Not sure why it allows you to adjust photos when posting multiple photos if it's not going to save and post it as you've adjusted them.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 out of 3 posts in my feed are actually people I follow now. Just endless ads and suggestions. Almost everything is video. If you click on a video it takes you to reels and puts the sound on, so you're constantly having to jump to turn your sound off when around people. Then you have to press back to get out of reels mode. For someone who uses this app as it was originally intended, as a photo album with social media attached, it is not for for purpose."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I add a trending audio track over the video's original sound, the ""Controls"" button that allows you change the volume of both the original audio & the music track no longer works. I cannot turn the volume of the audio track down at all, so it is playing at full volume alongside my original audio. This is extremely frustrating because I want soft background music playing while I talk in the video, but that isn't possible anymore due to this new bug."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Upon scrolling the feed, posts number 1, 4, and 8 were sponsored content from accounts I don't follow for things I don't care about.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's the point of instagram if i can't share and engage with others? When sharing a multi-picture post with friends, it never shares the picture I'm actually looking at it always shows a different one in the deck. It can't keep track of my most recent DMs list either it's constantly throwing in random acccounts and groups that i haven't used in years. Lastly, the regulations around spam are ridiculous. 3 comments in one post is spam? Just say you're taking the social out of media."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A few examples of bad experience UX. 1. Every now and then I cannot see the actual time of when a story was published. It always says ""1s"" at the top. Not sure why happens, but it happens on periods of time. 2. Expanding a photo poat w/ longer description results in the text being hidden. Any suggestions on how to fix those from the vendor of this app are welcome"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has become so glitchy when it comes to posting images on your feed. Whenever I save a draft and I go back to edit the aspect ratio and positioning changes from what I selected, and it doesn't allow me to change it back. The quality of images and videos posted also severely diminishes that it looks as though you've used a really old phone. The app is certainly not as good as it once was. Do better instagram."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is super buggy now. It has been like this for a while, and it keeps getting worse somehow! It keeps spamming me with all the notifications I've gotten for the day on an hourly basis. So it just rapid fires notifications I've already seen, over and over. It'll freeze on me when I'm trying to post stories too and there are times where it will ONLY show suggested content and nothing else. No amount of phone restarting, un/reinstall seems to fix it, and the app is up to date. Its trash now."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Posting stories is weird. It makes the video looked kinda squished when previewing and the sound is behind from the actual video. Then when posting it, it says ""processing and stays there instead of going back to my feed. When trying to post multiple videos on my feed, I press the arrow to post a caption, but it stays on ""processing"" and never moves from there. So I can only post one at a time."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I also have same problem , since a few months now, I am facing troubles with Instagram which I thought of initially as a technical error. But it's persistent. My Instagram doesn't load fully and properly. It's stuck. Suppose I click a story to view it, it keeps on loading. Same with some accounts and even my feed. Please look into this. Update: Seems to have been fixed. But a few technical glitches seem to be always there."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since one of the prior updates, most of the time, when I open Instagra, it frequently comes up with a black background on all posting comments.

This has been happening numerous times a day for over a week. Please fix this issue As Soon As Possible!"

When you try to watch reels, there is an auto reminder to continue swiping up to continue watching other videos but it's so freaking annoying! It just makes the video you are trying to watch bounce a bunch of times and it's obnoxious af. I like the app for what I'm using it for, but for entertainment... it's annoying"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trying to post a picture from my camera roll to story, but the app doesn't see any photos in the camera roll. Only sees screen shots or downloads. I've signed out and in, deleted and reinstalled, reset all settings, etc.. It's been a month and IG has not done anything about it, or try to help. I'll have to use a different app for my content creation now. And of course there's no way to get a hold of them. They better fix this soon"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Endless ads, getting worse every week. In different accounts I manage you folks keep moving the options to share to story, threads and reels, and it's infuriating. Most recently, SD card files (images and videos) are not properly showing up when looking to upload photos or videos, in any format. Only internal memory and older files are showing with some random cutoff date. This is a major bug that needs to be fixed and we need options to ""see all"" and ""see SD"" folders, too!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I try to post multiple pictures and add music behind it, it won't give me the option like everyone has. When I'm in the middle of editing pictures to posts, the screen will freeze and go black. I'm forced to restart the app and sometimes that doesn't even work, I have to restart my phone entirely. I don't always receive all of my messages, some will appear and become visible and some won't."

Additionally, every time you scroll, switch to another app, and return to Instagram, the timeline refreshes, hindering a seamless experience while browsing through feeds. These issues affect usability."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using IG for years but the functionality has been gradually going downhill, especially compared to other platforms. Constant glitches and features disappear and reappear from one minute to the next. Not user-friendly at all, especially when creating reels. For example, SOMETIMES (not always) there's an option to crop a cover image for the square grid view but even after cropping it reverts back after posting. Also adding sounds and multiple texts to reels is glitchy and frustrating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has many faults and bugs but I can give the lowest rate even only because of this one: when you have a story consisting of a few slides with sound or added songs, then most of the time when you play the story, at some points of some slides your playback is going to be stopped, looking as if the slide(s) needed to load. The only thing you can actually do then is to skip the faulty slide, which is going to stay faulty usually even if you reattempt playing the story many times."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Making reels is a terrible experience! Every time I try to make 1 from my highlights, it never works. The editing tools are difficult & always has errors. It's the worst after you spent so much time working on it and lose everything or can't go further. Editing stories is a nightmare as well. How have they not figured out a better way for us to edit our content within the app?? One of the biggest companies in the world yet they have terrible UX which should be their entire focus."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I can give the app a zero, I would. It used to be so nice, but it's complete trash now. The app won't read my SD card to post photos when it used to work just fine. It auto scrolls to the next reel, refreshes without warning. Now, it won't let me see older posts of people I follow when I click on that option. It's responsive only 2/3 of the time. I don't know what's happening and it needs to be fixed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the most recent upgrade, I am not able to view all the photos on my phone. I have tried multiple things and still cannot see all the photos, which means I don't post. And if I'm not posting, what's the point? Unimpressed at the moment! Fix it and the üåü might increase...! Edit : I found a way to upload my photos - by moving them to the WhatsApp images file. It works, but is not ideal."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Scrolls up every time you change apps. If you want to share something then you'll risk losing your current video if you want to watch it. There is no tutorial or indication on how or if it's even possible to keep the app from restarting at the top every time you tab out. Also you can't upload from PC? It forced you to install this trash app if you want to upload anything. I'm good.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is constantly limiting, blocking, deleting, closing and sensoring accounts especially business ones for reasons unknown. Nothing works against their ""community guidelines"" for certain pages. But a business page like mine reacts to a post and calls it hilarious and gets banned for commenting for 30 days. Created an account for a new Business.. put the logo up.. and 2 pics of hair products account banned. This is getting out of hand."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great HOWEVER! it would be better when a friend sends you multiple reels and you can just scroll down to the other one rather than watching and going back to the chat to open another one
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not well optimised for pixels. Although my pixel 6a device allows 3rd party apps to use all the camera sensors and night mode, Instagram doesn't make use of it, still takes the screenshots instead of actually clicking the pictures. There is also a bug that needs to be fixed. If there is a post with multiple pics or videos in it, when we open it the first photo or video goes black. Unless we swipe to the second and come back to the first, the first one will not be visible."

In fact, this deserves 6 stars. The reason for that is he variety of content creators and videos you can scroll through. This is actually so fun when you are kind of bored and nothing to dedicate your time to. Overall, amazing app"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very difficult to use, and lacks explanation for basic functions. Doesn't have a way to upload things from a laptop, which could have solved some of these counter-intuitive features that are on the app. Also way too many filtered photos that aren't marked as such, contributing to body image issues. Not to mention a bunch of ads for useless counterfeit products from China. Edit: Latest update makes it impossible to see older posts"

There are many different issues with that but that is not the main issue that I'd like to talk about in this review. The main problem is when I want to post multiple pictures. They are automatically set as squared even when they are originally in a 3x4 ratio. It can't be changed in the app and messes with the whole vibe of the pictures...

I lost my entire profile with pictures I will never be able to retrieve. It claims that I shared my password with 3rd party sites looking to receive likes. FALSE, and there is no way to contact anyone to dispute this error. Links lead to dead-end links that are not working. Terrible. It's a convenience that it happens on an election year.

After reaching out multiple times to different support pathways, no solution was found to recover my account, so I made a new one. Now this app is treating my new account as if it were a spam/botted account. Meta sucks, they don't know how to manage programming, their algos are programmed by toddlers."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it is painfully obvious that instagram doesnt care about its users anymore. small artists like myself have no way of getting reach because of the removal of the 'recent' feature in hashtags and thats not even it. the app is buggy and turning into a tiktok clone. eveer since the notes update my account wont update no matter how many time i uninstall or log out. if this doesnt get better soon im sorry but i have no choice but to put my time and energy into an app that actually respects it.

I've logged in & out and used different accounts; I've also uninstalled & restarted the device multiple times & issue wasn't fixed. I logged in on my web browser on my account and tried posting from there and it works but the app doesn't. Frustrating!!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App feels to be broken after last updates. Clicking on comments button while watching reels doesn't open them, one have to click somewhere between like and comment to open comments. But it may also lead app to hang at the same time.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why can't I upload videos anymore unless they're under a minute or recorded with the in-app camera? Bad design, totally arbitrary, needlessly frustrating. As a musician who just records videos on my phone, wishing to record multiple takes and post the best one later, Instagram is becoming increasingly useless to me. Edit: I tried the in-app camera to record a song and for some reason you have to hold down the record button, so that obviously doesn't work. This app is living in the stone age."

Far more sponsored content than in the past, and now there are automatic website pop-ups on accounts that advertise to me. No matter how many accounts I block, the experience is soul-crushing. I tend to go many months without looking at Instagram because I hate it so much. Only good thing is the saved collections, because I don't want to publicly like everything that interests me."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They put your photo where they want it in the feed now. Not the order it was posted. The paid advertising gets shown multiple times and they hide things posted by the people I follow. It, like everything else is more focused on money, than the consumer. I stand by this statement and it has only gotten worse. Seems politically and financially motivated to me.... Now they're targeting me and my account, limiting views, altering comments, not allowing me to use the app normally. Cyber assault IMO"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. But the problem is if we want to downlode a reel only some reel have option to down.... and if it's downlodes the voice is not available. Only this is my problem And all the things are good If the downlode option will valid so it such a nice app
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There is some glitch right now where it doesn't show captions. If you click into the comments and then back out, the it will finally show up but it's super annoying and inconvenient. Also the auto refresh is getting out of control; you can barely finish looking at something before it's gone. If I want to refresh my feed, guess what, I will refresh it. If I am not initiating it then I don't want it!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I went from Instander to the newest version of Instagram and I can't believe how unstable it is. Reels load black, music keeps playing when I've closed the application, reels load choppy... hate it."

I already refreshed the timeline and see the new reel that showed up but turned out the below of it were the same reel that i've wateched and it keep going multiple times till now. 3. Bug on saved album list. The bug is anoyying and seems like got duplicated a lot"

Clicking the tab ""tags"" after searching doesn't let us browse the actual tagged posts but keeps returning to the ""for you"" tab/feed. Really annoying!! 2022: Browsing hashtags under ""recent"" tab only show some recent ones but when I scrolled down just a bit further to keep browsing, there are posts from 2019, 2018. Some hashtags only show 10 new posts then old ones from 1 year ago. Not showing many recent ones."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has deteriorated. It seems that the project was abandoned or the company is not putting enough effort in the customer experience. Full of bugs, tons of ads and poor written algorithms. It's so annoying that the app tries to click bait you into very poor quality videos submitted by people that just want attention and clicks. The ""search screen"" is full of them. Where is the good content? Where are the good accounts? Why can't the algorithm figure my taste out?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Welp I guess Instagram don't like me because I have been a)Logged out of my account. B) when I have been logged into the account it will not let me confirm anything by text message or email. C) finally when I have gotten in, I can't even do two step verification or confirm my ACTIVE email or SMS.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hello, Instagram support, I would like to suggest you a good suggestion with the development of videos, which has been a great addition to the Instagram application in recent times. Users started writing stories or videos from movies, which were divided into several videos. When a latecomer tries to find the second part of the clip and doesn't find it in large numbers from the videos, you should add the follow option, thanks.‚ú®ü•∞"

First off, I can't even save pictures on insta I have to post them to my story to save them. Alot of my story archives just say December 31st, 1969. EDIT: Yall just took a feature away from me. I'm a public account. I'm so fed up. Edit 2: the issues still haven't been fixed. EDIT 3: I can't post on my story without the app closing, like I open the camera and it crashes.

Fix this bs."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Relatively good social media platform. But something needs to be done about the awful scammy ads that appear while looking at stories, they often use pictures of celebrities or just pretty women and promote ""movies"" it's disgusting and the response I get after reporting is just an automated reply telling me there was nothing wrong. I even try to hide them because I'm obviously not interested but they keep appearing. PLEASE FIX THIS. It's made me stop viewing stories altogether. They are scams."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hey! I used to rate it at 5 stars. But it's gone downhill. I see a lot of stuff promoting eating disorders and toxic stuff. There should be regulations about this. It's a good app otherwise. But I also believe that you should be able to edit your messages for longer as long as the other person doesn't respond or see it. It also doesn't do anything about reporting people and it doesn't kick people off for doing problematic things, even when they're illegal."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like, comment, and share button no longer work on reels. Does not register the tap at all. Checked on other apps and this is not present. Often it will not swipe to the next reel either."

I never used a service to boost likes. I just liked other ppls comments on posts and followed ppl, and now because I just hit 100 followers, Instagram chose to kick me off because I got there without paying to do it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Your app is a bit frustrating, when one is trying to be a part of an Important conversation and you refuse to let it slide. Thats very unfair. Everyone has the right to use every feature in the app as he wants. By so doing, you are taking away our social right. All because you're the man at the back-end of the system."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't think to give one star also . It doesn't deserve atleast one star because it has always bug problem, new scenario with me is ,it showing one chat message in your account and when I checked there is no message. It show that notification again and again. Very disappointed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is clunky. The reels freeze alot and you can't fast forward. The app constantly shuts down and glitchs for a day before it finally works. And they ban you for posting stuff about movies when other people are posting videos of death and destruction. Get your act together Instagram
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Overbearing amount of videos and can't turn off auto-play. Too many ads. Searching tags only shows ""top"" posts instead of all posts, making it impossible to see content from smaller creators. This app is unbearable now."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I post comments that break none of the guidelines but the system just removes my comments, saying they broke the rules. I can't see some of my DMs, I can only read half of them when I get them as notification, sontimes posting a collection of photos on story just doesn't work and Instagram on desktop is slow, laggy and can't load my DMs there anymore."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't very much appreciate that while I'm watch a video or reading a post that is politically or has to do with socioeconomic issues that the app will all the sudden reboot, refresh, or blackout. I dont my content policed. This is why meta keeps losing users and the rest are getting too old kinda like a dying church."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is an awesome and well functionable app. But it has a critical basic shortcoming - it doesn't allow to unlike multiple posts at once, which is really annoying. Sometimes, it doesn't even allow to unlike a single post which is not good. The app should should allow users to unlike multiple posts with ease. What if a user wants to reset the kind of posts he/she wants to see on the search page. Please provide such a functionality to unlike multiple posts with ease else I'll have to switch."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For two weeks I haven't been able to add newest photos to instagram direct from the app, as it nonlonger connects to certain folders on my phone, including the camera. Despite the fact it is supposed to be an app for sharing photos. I can share from Facebook, which is farfrom ideal, copy photos to other albums which is long winded or from the gallery, also long winded. Instagram is now virtually useless."

Ads, suggested pages, ad, reels of stolen content, etc and NO POSTS of the ppl I follow. Thankfully they now added a tab where I am forced to click all the time in order to see my fam. I've missed so much. I stopped following pages and famous ppl. I wish I could filter so I can follow ppl and still have a tab just for close fam and friends. IG has gone downhill. FB ruined it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has forever worked fine for me but the problem I've had for a while was the new 'Instagram Notes' update. See, I had it when it first came out and absolutely loved it, but after a few days n' maybe weeks in of using it, I all of a sudden cannot use it. It doesn't show up, nor does it let me listen to my friends notes 'n case they have music because it'll say 'This song isn't available in your country'. I don't know what it means, but if you could help me get it back, I'd be very happy."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My biggest complaint is the filters interface. Of I try to find a filter using the search button while on the story camera, once you click it only takes a picture. Usually you can browse when accessing through that same button but now it only takes the picture. Also when uploading a picture to yout stories and while trying to edit it using/browsing the filters you have saved, you can search either and most of your filters don't appear."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has truly taken a turn for the worse- and repeatedly. I wish we could make the chronological timeline that's composed of just people you follow the default (you know, how it used to be ages ago!). I also don't want to see suggested threads. I'm not interested in that app nor in seeing any of it's content. All of this mixed in with the insanely high number of ads just makes this app so incredibly unfriendly towards users and makes curating what you see near impossible."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a few years and I enjoy it but over the past few months I've found some really annoying glitches. My main issues are that sometimes I'll try to add some recently posted stories to a highlight and they won't show up in the select menu. Also, the images for my post drafts delete after around 12-18 hours, the caption will be intact but I won't be able to post it since the pictures/videos are gone. Despite that, I still enjoy the app and Ive found some nice communities."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't open the app without animal abuse being all over it. Almost every reel I'm forced to scroll past is ""rescue"" accounts posting extremely graphic and upsetting content. No amount of account blocking or pressing the useless ""not interested"" button does anything. Blocking keywords and tags does nothing. I can't go on this stupid app without being made upset."

It used to be more fun and interactive to engage, eith the opportunity to connect with ppl from all over the world. The experience now is much more isolated. Boring. Hope they will find a way to create a sustainable business model that allows more users to engage with each other, and not just popular accounts they can slap afs in between the feed posts"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've had no issues with Instagram all these years but it's been a few days now and my Instagram has been glitchy. I would get a flood of past notifications even though I have already opened them but they keep popping up in a wave of notifications. I tried reinstalling and googling but nothing helped. Kind of getting sick of this. Ps. It's not the same case with my other phone.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is literally such a shitshow. At random times when Im scrolling through reels, a video will just pause out of nowhere and not unpause no matter what I do. Also, on the Messages portion of the app, videos and pictures have been taking forever to send, literally thinking of using Snapchat again, lol. And sometimes, when people post on stories, their story won't show until way later than the time they posted it. Even after reloading. And more glitches, too, when posting stories."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After this update I'm facing lot of problems After the story starts, it is no longer visible, it is turning black and only sound comes. I don't know how many other problems there are, please fix it."

But have been told my account will be deactivated because I have been accused of scamming. That is total nonsense. All I do is share my music and book collections. I have no idea how to scam people, I can't even get in the online appeal form because I've forgotten my password. I think someone has copied my account to scam people."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There is something wrong with the app tonight. I have tried force stopping it and reinstalling but it keeps doing this really weird thing where the photo/post is fine until I get to the caption page and then it just randomly flips the image upsidedown for no apparent reason. And even if I try to post the updown image I get an error message. Please help! Thank you...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram sucks, I can't schedule posts, when I've tried to contact support or get the problem fixed no response( I've tried multiple times) insta regularly deletes the captions on my reels, won't let me get rid of drafts except posting them and recently when editing a reel the audio disappeared, couldn't edit placement of text and if I clicked to change the words it made my phone buzz nonstop. I'm not going to mention algorithm much but I know it has not been the kindest to some including me."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app still needs alot of improvement. They will literally downgrade the quality of your videos on reels for no reason at all! Same with picture reels. They are not the same quality as just a regular post! Also randomly zooms in your photos just a lil bit, throwing all good angles off completely! It's not fair because you don't get what you posted. You get a slightly lesser quality, zoomed in picture that's now a different angle than what you posted!"

All new stickers don't show up in the edit tab at all and even after clearing cache and restarting the app it persists. Happy to record my screen too to prove I'm not just using it incorrectly. Reel editor is full of glitches and missing features. Terrible for an app trying to complete with tiktok"

Hey if I want to watch the same video consecutively 10 million times, then I will do so because I chose to, alright?! It's frustrating that the programmers thought it was a good idea to implement this. Seriously you can be the judge of many times I'm allowed to view a video. I'm not a child. Provide an option to turn this off or remove it entirely please. Else I'm switching to tik tok!!"

Picks up some common comments and flags it as inappropriate. And the AI is just not smart enough to correct that. Full of fake ads being pushed, that need to be blocked by Instagram but keeps promoting those. So basically, you can get away by saying illegal things as long as it's an advertisement."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever. It supports genocide and propaganda. There is no concept of free speech here and it aggressively controls the content to change the course of events! Also spreads false information.

Easy to find art though. ALSO apparently they made the size of buttons even smaller so when trying to heart a post, it does something else entirely unless I press the exact center of the heart. Also freezes constantly, and there's next to no moderation, just a half-baked bot. Trashy app."

I use this app a lot but noticed recently that some stuff has disappeared and some newer features just don't show on my app, despite having the latest update. For example, I no longer have a translucent ""highlight"" option on any of my fonts - just solid white and black. I don't have the highlighter option in my edit tools, size of text seems to be limited to the slider bar on the side, and I can't layer in stories. So frustrating!"

The way your feed is made up of random posts by people you don't even follow, and not in chronological order, is so annoying. in my feed i want to see posts from people i follow, and in chronological order. i keep ""losing"" posts because i accidentally reload the feed and suddenly it's totally different. i like the explore page, but please fix the feed."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can't upload more than 15-20 seconds of a reel. Which basically makes Instagram useless to me now since all my reels are several minutes long. I feel like I keep having to update my 1 star reviews to new 1 star reviews because different things keep happening than leave the app unusable to me.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The new update is complete trash. Why take away the ability to share posts on your story? You are ruining people's chances at gaining popularity faster. Ever since you started updating it with useless things like only promoting reels and constantly moving around the buttons I've had less and less respect for this app and company as a whole.

You cannot fix your bugs when creating reels. I stopped making content because of the ridiculous bugs, for example, zooming in a video clip unnecessarily, taking time to load stories. You could do a LOT. Or just don't. Go back to being basic if you can't handle extra."

Conversely, on days when I haven't used the app at all, it still shows a substantial amount of time spent. This inconsistency is concerning, as it does not accurately reflect my actual usage patterns. I rely on the time spent feature to monitor and manage my social media activity."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,is relatively easy and you can promote your business making campaigns on Instagram stories. The algorithm always looks for a target audience that is interested on what you are selling and this is something that people can take advantage of. Cons: There are many fake businesses and scammers that appear every day on Instagram stories trying to make honest people lose their money. I think that Instagram has to pay more attention on what is being promoted as a service or product. Rachael Ok Hii

I get restricted for ""spam"" for typing a song name to help someone out, but I guess people can spam ""free palestine"" wherever and not get penalties. Instagram has seemed very one sided lately and not the best for individual people I'd say. But thats my experience"

You will not be shown to anyone anymore. Cannot search for new creators as they have replaced the recent posts with the most popular recent posts. Sponsored posts don't even work. You might get 10 likes if you pay. Overall, this app has reached the dumpster level. I can't wait for something new and for this circus to crumble. 0/10 stars.."

Growing your account on instagram and feeling helpless in logging back is not a good experience. Instagram also doesn't respond to support mails. Then what's the point of customer support.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't get the hype. For consumption, the content I get suggested is too often repetitive at best. I get a few posts from creators I follow and then it's just junk. For creation, the it's buggy and clunky. You also can no longer get decent suggestions for hashtags. Meta now really want reels and they're doing a worse job than TikTok for both: creation and consumption. The only reason I see why its more popular than FB is that there are less angry boomer arguments."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Previous review: 5-stars Edit: I still keep seeing the contents I do 'uninterested'. The interface gets glitched sometimes ie same colored text as background. And the bad worst thing is my comments get deleted with no bad words.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is very difficult to get views and followers. I believe this is because of the algorithms and the way things are cycled. It can become very discouraging for a content creator.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So I guess its not just me that has seen a sharp decline on the health of the app. I consistently have been getting an intermittent issue where icons like the home/search/message/etc buttons disappear as well as text disappearing in post captions and comments. The app glitches and mixes up font color between light and dark mode (light text and icons on dark background vs dark text and icons on light background) so it gives light on light or dark on dark.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I gave it one star because Everytime I try to like a photo or accept friend requests it keeps saying we restrict certain activity and I don't like that I can only text and look at stories I can't like not one photos or nothing and I would like you to fix it and im about to uninstall it and never use it again

What a joke, have to protect those scammers at all costs I guess"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has made big improvements since my last post here. It runs more smoothly. I hold out on the 5th star because the special effects on the reels sometimes cause glitches. I notice when I do not use IG's reel effects, my reels run much smoother. Great upgrades though.

I've searched for ways to stop it and there isn't one. How is that even a thing? If I close my phone for a sec to talk to someone then open it to continue reading/watching NOPE!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1. the bloody spam detector randomly detecs comments as spam and deletes them after spending minutes writing them! 2. sending videos is almost impossible in DM and when they are in sending state there's no way to cancel it and it stays like that and lowers internet speed for hours! 3. the same thing happens if sending posts gets in trouble. you can't cancel them and it takes hours before either sending it or saying something went wrong!!

The drafts feature doesn't work, it either glitches when you go to save it as a draft or errors out when you post the draft.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely hate that I can't see notifications in the app (when you click the heart in the corner) from anything before a couple hours ago. Instead, it just gives me a list of suggested accounts to follow that I couldn't care less about. Give me notifications in the notification tab. How hard is that? I also hate the ""auto-refresh"" thing it does occasionally. In the middle of reading comments, it'll refresh and the post is gone forever if I didn't give it a like."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram used to be amazing, but now it's just trying too hard to be tiktok and the algorithm is horrible, the home page is only reels and as someone who likes insta for looking at art, it is incredibly infuriating.

But the amount of issues and glitches it has on the daily is just too much. Ever since Instagram was bought by Mega, it's been nothing but a huge failure. It won't let you post, chats dissappear, your messages glitch out too. Message requests dissappear. EVERYTHING dissappears at some point. It's so incredibly annoying and I wish I didn't need this stupid app to run a business. I hate it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't allow disabling reels. The account muting is also broken, with accounts who's story you've muted still having their stories appear. Additionally, disabling recommended posts doesn't actually disable them, it just pushes them to the bottom. When a button turns something off, it should turn it off. Doing otherwise is incompetence or malice."

I can now only see my in-app notifications from about an hour ago to present, and the rest of the page shows a bunch of random accounts to follow that I have no interest in following.

I've reported the problem but nothing has been done. Why would it? When has anything the user says actually been taken notice of? Shame really. It's also funny how a normal reel post will play only once, but an advert will continually play..."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram has an annoying habit of deleting content that does not violate any policies and reports the wrong account . I would not recommend Instagram as it targets the wrong people and does not do anything about the actual issues. 1star because 0 stars isn't an option
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly I didn't know this app could get worst. I use Instagram for my business and haven't been able to post my content pictures or video for 3 months. They are not showing up in any of my folders to pick from. When I try to share from my picture or video in my gallery it just takes me to the app and not the post screen link it used to. Or goes to a different account. It's ridiculous that I can't even post what I want to now.

I've really tried to like Reels but it just seems like they saw TikTok and said ""yeah we can do that"" expept they can't do it as well as TikTok. Just miss the old IG where things actually worked"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Could you add features where u can archive highlights? HIGHLIGHTS, not stories. I think it would be great if you could still watch ur old stories in those collection that u made(highlights), instead of just deleting them, but can only watch the stories on the calender one. I hope u guys could take this suggestion into consideration as it would rlly mean a lot to other ppl as well : )"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram one of the best social media app in which you can share your own post and the most beautiful thing about this app is the reels I love watching this reels and the problem is that there is no stop option after playing the video though it is very bad for me all social media app has this option so who am I to say instagram that it should be brought very soon app
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Seriously just stop updating the app at this point. They break it everytime. 2024 update: you guys went a solid 2 years where it was actually pretty tolerable... Yet you've brought me back here again with transition bugs and more BS. With that Meta money you can do better

It makes me sadn anxious, and causes panic and dissassociation. I miss when the world wasn't controlled by algorithm. Update - the app continues to collapse into ruin. We thought we could fight it off, and many died in the blasts... but Metas soldiers kept pushing... slaughtering.... it was the most horrific thing I'd ever witnessed. Update in 2024: Still trash"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The initial opening of the app when it shows your feed, you start reading a post and it scrolls because it has loaded more new posts so you have to scroll down quite a bit to find the post you were reading, incredibly annoying.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram has been the messiest app I've ever seen. I mean it makes it EXTREMELY hard to log in or sign up to any of your accounts. Plus it keeps telling you that something went wrong but they really don't even know what went wrong and leaves you frustrated like that and you they are not even trying to actually corporate and solve your problem. Like do not choose it as a means of communication or entrainment IT WILL GET MESSY. Edit: still trying to recover my accounts. One of the worst things.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"they only focus on features to make them more money. These features help ruin your experience on the app. the app automatically updates your entire feed and you can't find old posts. Reels and posts automatically move to new ones if you watch one twice without you scrolling. and I constantly have fake notifications that won't go away (been this way for multiple years). every 3rd post is an ad or ""suggested"" post by Instagram. it's turning into a horrible app and being horrible for society."

There's really no point towards keeping an app that was designed to share images when you have to go ridiculous measures just to post something. And it doesn't help that Instagram hasn't addressed this issue to give some sort of reassurance that something is being done about it. Plain and simple, they're going to lose a lot of android users if this continues"

Story bugs, posting bugs and ""older posts"" are just annoying but the fact that I can't clear cache is detrimental and should be fixed. And why aren't the photos from my memory card visible when other apps ""see"" them? One less star as of right now cause I can't post a photo unles it's a screenshot of a photo strored on a memory card."

Hire some people from Youtube to learn how to implement pause and play. As your product managers to think ...

They love to restrict little accounts but refuse to do anything about the scam or onlyfans accounts.

Suggestions appear repetitive. No music access. What even worse is, message notifications appear after being and replied. And more importantly, response to reported content is often delayed and is not even looked into, mentioning short of resources due to the high volume of reports.

Totally inconsistent behaviour between platforms, but at least the Android version lets you edit posts most of the time unlike others that just spin and spin... If they fixed the aspect ratios not working properly (Windows app version is the best for this, but fails in other major ways) it would be worth an extra star at a pinch. New bug: notifications missing the associated image; reported twice, no sign of a fix."

Terrible feed design that forces you into reels at every opportunity makes me close the app out of frustration constantly. Algorithm on the main feed is equally awful and you can't change settings to make the default page ""following"". I get that in-app time is where the money is at but what a joke of a user experience. Do better."

First, the feature to add music in posts, I can only add music when I only upload 1 photo. but, if I upload more than 1 photo I can't add music. while I see many friends and people on social media who use the feature, but I can't. second, the feature to tag people in stories, I can't do it. the ball to tag people."

Unfortunately, writing captions for Instagram stories is not accessible for the blind. When we want to write a caption for a story, we must adjust the text so that it does not fall on a certain part of the video or photo that we post and does not have a bad effect.

After updation, iam not able to edit my comments anymore, because edit option has been removed. Now Long press on the comment leads to ""delete""option. If, in case we want to edit any of our comments, we need to delete the comment and start typing again. This is really frustrating. Also, the reels or videos gets hung in the middle.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's frustrating. Reels don't post correctly. Sharing on facebook seems optional at best ( its own choice). Creating and saving reels has become disappointing as they go corrupt before you get a chance to upload and the. You have to start over. I've wasted so much time redoing projects. It's crazy.

I have gotten into the habit of writing my captions elsewhere so they don't get lost when it inevitably crashes during editing/upload And why advertise threads with a ""see more"" option that leads nowhere?

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is so garbage. I could never see who views my story without having to log out and in again or delete the app and reinstall again. It freezes a lot having to close the app again and the recent update is so annoying. Why do you need to send a message to someone who was tagged in a post. You never did this before and now it's annoying when I receive multiple messages when someone tags me in a post. I don't need an inbox message as well.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently facing lots of glitches, messages don't show up, there are notifications saying 'you got messages from so and so person during night mode' but after I open instagram, it's simply not there, later after a certain period of time suddenly I see messages from a friend who texted like 10-15 hrs back. Few of my friends are also facing similar issues."

I and many others have submitted reports but nothing has been done nearly a month later. The only fix has been to revert to an old version of the app, but now this doesn't work as feed posts are being blocked. Apparently Meta are doing this to disincentivise SD card users?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the random freezes are annoying. They've only been happening recently to do in sure it a problem with the most recent update. Also the notifications are out of wack. For some reason, it won't give me notifications at the time the thing it's notifying me about happened. For comment likes and such it's fine But for chats, it's annoying because someone will message me something and I'll only get a notification like half an hour later. And it'll give me notifications of things I've already checked."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you like constant intrusive ads then you'll love this app. I would give 0 stars if I could. My feed is now over 50% advertisements.

I turned off the ability to save posted photos, but it still does it. Not to mention that whenever I select a profile from a user's following list & then exit the profile of a person they follow, it sometimes takes me back to the top & I have to scroll down again which can get annoying. Please fix."

That would be astronomically appreciated."

The app was working perfectly this entire time. The recent addition of longer story tabs was helpful to me so I updated it. Worse decision... Now my app is constantly having trouble loading content - either comments, profiles, or posts. It just keeps loading or it will say it couldn't load. I am ANNOYED.

The amount of times I've been dinged for having ""misleading comments, or trying to get likes and support from others"" I DO NOT DO THIS FOR ME. I am just a person trying to support other artists who deserve it. Instagram has been backlashing me for about a week now. I'm reporting this issue asap because this is getting ridiculous and uncalled for."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Again this particular app is doing the same when I was commenting on a video saying I'm spam I'm repeating the same content to get likes and etc. What the hell is that.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I doubt anyone even reads these reviews- but I would just like to say, Instagram has been pretty buggy lately. Instagram will remove some of the most random comments I make, claiming it goes against their guidelines or something. Then, Instagram completely bugs out and I can't even open the app for awhile, because whenever I do, the screen saying my comment was removed will pop up. I've done nothing wrong and I think it's unfair that my comments are being removed for no apparent reason."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the recent updates I'm not able to access my photos on SD card on my Android phone. That means I can't post any my own pics unless I don't screenshot them. Ridiculous! I've been clearing cache, uninstalled and installed the app back etc... nothing works. On the reviews I can see that several people started to have the same problem with Android phones at the same time after recent updates. Makes app almost useless."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've truly never had a problem with Instagram, I've been using it for several years now. Never had issues outside of photo quality, hackers, and phone calls, I like how Instagram has improved over the years. I only wish for them to fix the photo quality. It tends to pixelate or get blurry in general, additionally; I wish for the phone call quality to be better. Sometimes, it's very hard to hear my friends. Or anyone I am directly talking to at that moment, all in all, Instagram is pretty good."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great to stay in touch with people and talk to everyone as well as share your creative endeavors but it regularly changes its format which can sometimes making it confusing as to where to find certain selections and there are way too many spam accounts and porn bots that start following you or request to follow you, that's the annoying part but, other than that, it's a good app."

Also while selecting photos for post if you choose select multiple the ratio is mismatched for different size of photos. Eventually the photos gets cropped. While posting if you forgot to select one photo and if you have to reselect a photo only select from recent photos is available

I'm just so confused. All in all 2 stars"

Especially the notifications, it's horrible not being able to see anything past an hour. If I want to respond to comments I have to search through my own profile to find which pic was commented on. A lot of the features are unreliable, it's so hard to post sometimes, and the tl is trash I never see any of my moots!! At this point I'd recommend any other social media app besides this one."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The stories keep saying error when I try to post my stories. The app allows all types of spam accounts to attack you without fixing the issue, and when I block someone, I keep getting a message that says that I cannot block them.

Every few days I need to delete all data and cache because instagram slowly takes up more and more storage. Like 100gb + with no drafts, no photos, or anything being saved on instagram. Not sure what's up with the editing and posting, but it's not exactly polished. Eg The closed captions for reels or stories nearly never work. Also uploading reels only sometimes works."

Would be nice that when you change parts of how your users interact with your app that they are notified of the changes made and how to use them. I also see an increase in bugs. I have about 10 posts which I get an error for and won't upload. I actually sent an email to your support but not a single reply after 4 days of waiting. Which is why I am writing this review.

When posting to my story I used to be able to browse and select a folder, now there's an undefined default that I can't adjust, and the default is missing a lot of my pictures.

Although I am not satisfied with this, as I am a anxious person, but the security centre of meta has ensured me that nothing is wrong with my ig account. You know I am confident about your app."

All the new changes being made to the app are annoying too, such as the new feature where if you tap a reel it just pauses instead of the audio turning off or on when you want it too. I'm also not a fan of the share bar being changed around. I share stuff to my story a lot and it's a pain when I go to click share to story and it's threads"

The search option when pressed gives you an unwanted full screen of distracting suggested public posts of photos & videos & send you down a hole of wasted time. Also, the Reels tab is annoying that it's a readily available tab, another attention grabbing rabbit hole for wasting time on tik tok style videos.. I think if they put the reels on the side bar menu option of the profile it would be better, that way it's hidden."

I love how someone Instagram thought it was a great idea to implement an auto scroll feature before you can turn it off in settings. Sometimes it tries to scroll BEFORE A REEL IS OVER.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't get why Instagram is so popular - you can't have horizontal and vertical aspect photos in the same post, you can't have more than 10 photos in a post, you can't have individual captions on your photos, and you can't edit posts or comments after posting, all things you can do on Facebook. People mostly just passively like photos on Instagram, vs any meaningful interaction or engagement. It seems an inferior product to me and I'm only there because not all my friends are on Facebook."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been trying to reactivate my account since last two days with my mobile number but again and again an error is occurring. I checked YouTube and got to know that Instagram has not rectified this error since last three or four months.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Like Facebook, it struggles to load things such as stories/feed properly. Also very annoying how following a new page results in your entire feed being filled with nothing but posts from said page uploaded over the past 3 months opposed to just showing what they post from the point of following onwards... Not as good as it used to be, filled with ads, reels and ""suggested posts"", a lite version would be great."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience is very good about it. Thanks Instagram. But one thing I think it is in every social application that when we post an informative thing it doesn't not goes on viral but that unnecessary thing do.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new Ai that analyzes comments is broken. No matter what I comment it is deleted by Instagram as Spam. I can post ( I like the upload thanks.) and it gets my account restricted and the comment is removed with a threatening series of violation warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è. This App was really fun and enjoyable about 10 months ago. Now it is saturated with politics and that wrecks the experience for me. I come to Instagram to get away from toxic politics. So sad for this once great company.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the main reason i gave it the lowest rating is because it keeps removing my comments even though i didn't break the privacy rules, it mostly says 'you're trying to get likes in a missleading way' i dont even share content on instagram so why would i want to get likes? and what makes me mad is this notification of 'we deleted your content' pops like every 2 seconds, i can't even reply to text messages i think iam gonna stop using this app iam just wasting time anyways"

I will get notified of people following me but as soon as I go to the app I can't see it, the only notification u can actually see and interact with r likes on ur comments or something, on top of that they recently added a threads button where the 'add to story' button was and it's SO ANNOYING! Honestly they should just delete the updates and go back to the original version"

The save feature on chats hasn't even worked for months.

App constantly broken videos inside DMs haven't been loading for months"

Now the comments are one long line (on mobile devices) whereas before the user could see all the text and proofread it before sending it. Please make the UI more user friendly. Also I'm wondering what drives the pictures that come up in the search window? I get many that I have no nothing to do with the search. I see the comments for ads are suppressed. Why is that? Retailers don't like feedback?? The auto update is so annoying. Users should be able to disable it.

The algorithm pushes toxic and hateful/negative content in reels, even after clicking ""not interested"" repeatedly.

Even with data saver on videos still auto play, not to mention ads every third story. The little heart icon always has a red dot even when there isn't anything new. This app is literal trash being held up by content creators that haven't moved to something else yet."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Do have a fairly good experience with using Instagram and their app, provided that if the app works properly! I've never really stumbled upon notable breaking bugs, but last few updates seem to removed or broken SD card access despite it having permission to photos and videos. I don't use internal storage for my camera photos (so I can transfer them over easily) but now I have to temporarily copy photos over to internal storage just to upload them within the app. Please fix this!"

The picture keeps getting cropped down to half the picture. Reinstalling temporarily fixes this glitch. This has caused my experience for the Instagram app to be affected negatively and why I rated it as I did. I enjoy the site itself but this issue is an absolute annoyance. I hope it will be resolved.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Non functional, half the time chat notifications show up either hours late or not until you open the chat with the specific person. Shorts is garbage and the whole app is centred around it. Insta will flood ur main feed with ""suggested"" content which drowns out all the people you actually follow, and the worst part of that is the ""snooze suggested content"" feature DOES NOT WORK, you can reload Instagram all you like a press that button all you want, and it WILL NOT REMOVE SUGGESTED CONTENT"

And if I miss the previous post notification, there is no way to find out who was it from since its been replaced by the new one. There should be a notification panel or tab inside the app. Please make each notifications separate. Edit: much better now, the notifications has been updated."

Second issue, whenever i put some story, sometimes i choose the song but the song is not added in the story and the story gets uploaded."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been around for years and it's still one of the worst functioning apps. Open the app and it immediately reloads for no reason? I think they do it on purpose so you spend even longer on their app trying to find whatever it is you just saw. The whole thing is just to mind-f*k you to look at more ads, get more riled up, and waste your life."

Someone needs to come out with a new app so I can delete IG after all"

Anti-intuitive, full of bugs, laggy, slow loading, full of restrictions, a nightmare for those who need it for work, anti-business, not user friendly and more. Waste of time and money.

Now with this stupid new update my video format is all wrong and won't upload anything without adding giant black borders around my videos.

I ONLY post reels on my account, and now they're awful, my followers are complaining to me and I have to keep telling them it's an instagram issue, FIX IT!!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With consistency, app crashes when you: 1) create a post from a few videos 2) add a filter to the video post 3) manually adjust the filter intensity up or down. It works for about 1 second and then either crashes the entire app, or brings you back to the ""new post"" page with no video selected"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is fine sometimes but has alot of problems. Currently wont let me open comments or like or shar videos. I can tap on them with a clean screen and all but it doesn't register. I cant make reels on the app anymore and have to upload them from a editing app. Audios will delete or freeze over and keep playing if i close the app or try to uplaod a new reel. Its annoying how bugs will get 'fixed' but then theres always new ones.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"To share pictures, it's cool. As a community, it's trash. IG's algorithm is basically a harassment bot, and there's no feedback, so it will only get progressively more dense. The only safe comment is üî•üî•üî•"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ive been using this app for 4 years and it was the best app ever but ever since instagram has been getting new updates it started glitching. Every time i post new stuff on my account there are 6 blocks over my post thats different colours and its so annoying and when i view stories it'll be as normal and then the next story will be completely black so then i have to go out of the story and back in to view what they have posted. Instagram has downgraded tbh.

There have been times it was my favorite app. I probably haven't spent more than 5 minutes at a time in the last year or so on insta because it is constantly inconvenient.

It's laggy, full with scam commercials and not promoting you properly even if you sponsor your posts.

I actually hate it and I hope there will be some alternative soon."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Darkmode barely functions. If I open an external link in a chat or even open someone's profile from a comments section, the darkmode feature will break, and the app will load dark text over a dark background, or light text on a light background. Typically if I open an external link, I have to close and reopen the app to resume using it because the darkmode crash renders the app unusable. Also your algorithm is AWFUL and the flood of reels suck, but you'll never fix those issues unfortunately."

Please reduce the amount of advertising and make it easier to use the main feed (the block under stories). This is the most important thing.

It's so annoying to navigate your text left and right with a cursor, which also randomly switches places messing everything you write. Make it a text box.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use this app because I enjoy following upcoming artists and small businesses. Seeing their content suppressed makes me contemplate deleting the app. This is really dissapointing. Will certainly be deleting if this doesnt change. I also find the reels rather pushy and irritating. This feature should be deleted or at least have an option that lets users block suggested reels from their feed. There is already an entire menu category for suggested content. Threads are also irritating.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This newest app update is so annoying. I enjoyed checking my story archives and previous posts each day. Now that's nearly impossible because I don't have the ability to see each individual month. It makes getting to the right point so unnecessarily difficult. I don't understand changing something and making it worse.

It crashes constantly and says I have notifications when I don't. I've tried checking my wifi and there's nothing wrong with it everything else in my home works fine and runs smoothly. So I was wondering when are u guys going to fix these problems and optimize Instagram? 2024 these same problems still happen. Every time I join a live the audio is slowed down immensely

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app used to be very good but for some reason my other account doesn't get any of the updates while my main does. I have also encountered a major problem which is that the top comments of any reels/posts are not showing and the sorting feature just disappeared. This problem is only on my main and It works normally how it used to on my alt. Please kindly take regard in this matter because it is very annoying not to see the top comments of any posts/reels.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app since many years N I'm glad to say that it's amazing but day by day it is creating problems in every feature.... Some kind of time limit is been setup on reel which I cannot even extend nor could turn it off.... N the second one is worst I cannot even take the screenshot of the chats as it says that it's restricted due to community guidelines why I can't even share the screenshot of message I receive.... I think Instagram should work on it asap!!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really getting frustrated with this app. The ads are now out of control. When I'm on my main feed, I want to quickly see the people I follow, not endless ads and suggested posts. When I browse search, by all means, show me suggestions. What you're doing, is lowering my engagement on the core part of the app, so I spend less and less time on it. The time wasted on ads is no longer worth the effort of keeping up with the people/personalities I had chosen to follow."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no way to navigate to a post you've previously seen. If you're on a zombie-scroll for a span and find a post you want to revisit. It's nearly impossible to find again if your app crashes or you navigate out of the app and the feed reloads.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All the new updates don't update at the same time across all my profiles, sometimes it's like using two different apps with how much differently they update. I also wish instagram had a feature to be staying at the same place in chat while replying to an old message, instead of coming all the way down to the new message I just sent. I have to scroll up back to infinity."

I have tried to make new accounts but it keeps logging out on their own . And secondly the note section is entirely lagging. Even though I have dark mode this keeps on showing light mode and lagging everytime . And why is Instagram lagging so much? I wasn't able to see my friend's text even if she sent me messages.! Fix these please!! And please, bring back the long bio optionüò≠üôè"

I wish the Ads paid campaign targeted my entire account content, and not just the selected post. I would like the App to provide me with incentives based on the number of views and engagements I create. For safety reasons, I would like the Instagram App to be equip with a FALL DETECTION SENSORS and linked to the emergency land line(Not just the shake phone to report)"

It is an absolute favorite of mine but don't get too addicted yes it's addictive but you can set a timer for how long you want to be on insta and when time is up it will pop up on screen no adverts and there's also parental options has really great features

Even longer than 1 minute and remixing g if reels!

Suggested content is severely off the mark, or viral-only crud. - Reels and photo drafts do not work, wasted time and effort - Notifications/dms are buggy - Follower count keeps jumping around despite no change in followers or notications for new ones. Count will bounce back up a few after couple days."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is full of ads, invasive of privacy, biased, and frankly evil. It constantly pushes content no one asked for. The only reason we all still use it is because we are slaves to the dopamine and addicted to knowing what's going on in other people's lives, which in a small group is healthy- but Instagram gives a distorted view of reality. Few take the time to sit with that and it's implications. It goes downhill further every year. No respect for person privacy or freedom of speech."

Pretty bad when an app made for posting photos makes it so if you dm someone photos theyre terribly degraded in quality. Doesn't have the same issue with posting photos, and it's not internet related to my knowledge, so I don't get why this is a problem me and many I know have. No longer able to get rid of suggested feed, and that along with sponsored content makes it intolerable to try and see posts of people you follow."

Other than that it's a great way for me to share my photography work and find inspiration in other people's work. .

And having a personal and business account on the app, anytime you switch from business to personal then back to business, Instagram automatically logs you out from your business account and it's really sad."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think this app is overall very good, but the algorithm is constantly changing, which makes it harder to know what appeals to my fanbase. Another problem I have with this app is that I still have no access to the Broadcast Channel tool despite really needing it. Please fix this soon."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Feed recommendations are just not working properly. Too many russian posts in my feed. And it's most some propaganda or advertisements. The thing is, I don't speak russian, I wasn't looking for any russian content on Instagram. I'm clicking ""not interested"" every time, when I see something in russian. But it doesn't help. Is Instagram paid for showing content like that?"

What in the actual heck? I just made them like two seconds ago, how is that even possible?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very useless application, total waste of time, instead of using this we can do something productive, everyday I am seeing new bug or glitch,with using high speed wifi I can't see reels without any interruption."

When I use insta on chrome I see my videos in best quality while in app they seem to be of very poor quality. Do something which will make the app play video in the way insta web plays so that they can be viewed in good quality.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The amount of bugs on this app is overwhelming. Have to restart the app several times before posting a video with so many crashes. Algorithm is sucking artists dry. What is happening?
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New Users will have a hard time finding reach on this app. Changes to the Search feature make it so the most popular posts are focused on, diminishing posts from smaller creators who may have up-to-date content. The push towards Reels (video) is a shameless attempt at chasing what TikTok has, and makes the app noisy and obnoxious. Every 30 days it pushes ""suggested"" content into a feed already bogged down by ads, and the suggested are always Reels. Pathetic that it can't be turned off entirely."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It currently has a bug which causes me to view same story multiple times. Even after seeing the story it still stays on top with that colourful circle which means we haven't viewed it yet. Very annoying please solve this

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has always been my standard social as it is easy to use, however as of late it has become increasingly infuriating. Now I am unable to leave a comment without it messing up my app due to them immediately removing anything I say for spam, and not allowing me to ask for human review. This is particularly annoying when putting a well thought out and respectful response to a debate only to have all that effort wasted. Insta needs a big change to its systems"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I actually really like this app, and it's the main social media app I use. Unfortunately, there is a lot more gore content flooding the app. I don't want/need to see this content and don't intentionally try to seek out this content. I really don't know how this started, whether I liked the wrong post or if I followed the wrong account. If I was looking for gore content, I'd download X instead."

Only way to resolve is to uninstall and reinstall the app, which only worked once, and then next time same issue. Can't post now until this is resolved"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please bring back the previous view! Why now there is nowhere to see the photos in the post, when reading comments? This is so inconvenient. Furthermore, why the music added to multiple photos post does not play all the way till last photos in the same post?"

I want to see posts from accounts I follow in CHRONOLOGICAL order, or have the option to sort them that way on my feed. 3. STOP HIDING POSTS FROM PEOPLE I FOLLOW. I want to see EVERY post from EVERY account I follow. 4. Bring back the ability to sort searches by the newest/oldest ALL, not ""top searches."" 5. If you're going to promote Reels over photos, make a separate app for those and let Instagram be for photos again."

Also,the site Forces u to use the phone app but its always janky, struggling to open and fails to load most options. If I could leave, I would. Im only grateful for the friends and family it keeps me connected to."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good bt my friend CHANCHAL AGRAWAL came up with a situation on Instagram. She says there must be an option to post full length photos too.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram has started to glitch a lot since the last few days. I can't open my DMs very easily. It buffers everytime I open my DMs. When I'm watching reels or a post all of a sudden it shuts down and I have to open it again.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why can't I post reels from my drafts? It keeps saying that there's some kind of issue, without clarifying what it is. This app seem to be having a new issue every other day, it's frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some things on Instagram are okay. Most things on Instagram are absolute toxic piles of garbage! Take the reels for instance... If you scroll through enough of them, you will find a plethora of women promoting some type of pornography. And somehow those posts are okay, but things that depict even a small amount of violence, or other kind of content that isn't nudity, are usually taken down. Instagram approves of pedophilia and scams btw."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is okay. One things that I would appreciate getting improved are the chats. I wish they worked like the ones on tik tok were you can start from the first reel that someone sent you and scroll down to the next sent video instead of having to go out of the current reel and find the next reel. 3 or more people send me reels and it's tedious to have to go back track and comment like I would like to because once I respond to a reel and sends me to the bottom of the chat. Thank you in advance
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been bugging for about 3 years now. The algorithm is completely messed up. My follower/following count changes randomly and is not in a normal way. If I gain or lose a follower, it doesn't reflect in the number until weeks later."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how it you upload a series of photos now, that the dots are in the picture on the bottom indicating how many photos are there.. also when you check what photo someone liked, when you click on it it just shows you your caption, and not the photo and who liked it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everytime I try to go on the app it just gives me a black screen and never loads. I've tried restarting my phone and uninstalling the app and then reinstalling. I've had this issue for about 6 months now
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is amazing. Improvements that can be done are to add the ability to be able to change the music on a post even after the post is posted and the ability to add or remove pictures from a post even after it's posted since I feel the need of removing or adding new pictures to a post.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please change the mechanism of sharing reels on story. It seems like first the reel is downloaded from your server into my device then re-uploaded to put it on the story and it takes a lot of time.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rubbish app. Uploading reel keeps getting stuck at 90% then hangs up your entire mobile data bandwidth even with a speed of over 40Mbps.

This app is the worst and keeps going downhill. It's CEO is destroying everything that was ever good about this app. Didn't understand why people were upset about all the ads up until suddenly my app was plagued with suggested advertisements. I try to hide as many ads as possible now by clicking ""it's irrelevant"", in hopes it stops showing me ads."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever. No matter how many complaints you raise there's no response. Also every 3 4 months they just simply block the account temporarily and then you cannot follow. Like. Comment or do any other particular things. I raised the complaint regarding account block notification came that it will expire on 9th April 2024. It's already 10th April and the problem remains the same.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Average experience lately. Accounts don't have full functionality and have different functions available. No media from SD card is visible to upload which is just CHAOTIC! Reels seem to be changing in size and don't display as they appear to before posting.. Please fix the gallery issues that multiple users are having, this is a major issue! For those with this SD card issue - you can use insta lite but of course you're then limited on some functions."

Other Android users are reporting the same issue, but no one at Istagram seems to care to fix it! I can still post photos straight from the camera roll, one by one, but I can't post multiple shots in the same post from within the app. My FB app can still access the camera roll, so this bug is only coming from Instagram."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Stop updating the app so tag notifications goes to messages instead of my regular notifications. It's incredibly annoying getting a message every time someone tags me in something. This was an update a while ago that was finally changed back to comments but now it's back to showing up in my messages and it's getting on my nerves. I doubt I'm the only one that feels that way.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Instagram is good but I don't like the frequent updates thats happening. It's ok if a new update pops up on your phone after 2-3 months later but it's too frequently and sometimes so confusing. Before it used to be really simple but these updates are making the use of Instagram really tough for some people. Other then that it's good so gonna give only 4/5 stars.

I can't read long captions of other accounts and I don't find any logical infirmation how to fix it. The translation tools is horrible. It's really hard to edit your own comments. I can't see recent posts in hashtags anymore, only the top recent ones, and it's frustrating. They don't show your posts that contain blocked hadhtags and you even won't know that it happens."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Basic things like clicking on your likes on a comment are too complex for the app. It'll force you to look at likes for a post instead. Someone over there in a manager position isn't doing a lot of managing it would seem. Maybe by now the app would have a direction to go rather than just being a glorified Snapchat filter for longer stories.

The music options to add to photos is trash and the algorithm makes it hard for creators to have their content seen.

This app is consistent in developing and improving everytime, and whenever I open this app I get excited and having fun all day, It has every information you could get and knowing a lot of people, their hobbies and interests. Instagram is very useful for me, when I'm feeling depressed I open and find something else to forget those depression and when I'm happy I open it to share with anyone."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagrams has had moments after some updates where everything seems to go laggy and not work properly, but that last few months everythings gone to hell on this app, content like buildings blowing up, deadly car crashes, and extreme weather are not censored as sensetive content, yet minor things like political memes are censored with a misinformation bar at the bottom. Everything is taking a long time to load aswell, spiraled downhill recently, also people getting away with sexualising minors."

There are enough other bugs that can turn the whole app against you."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The experience has become so very buggy - not something I expect from a company of this scale.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app since many years now. As an old user, I wanted to suggest a few updates, Instagram could work upon. Allow private account users to decide who can comment on their posts. Also allow easy transitions from public account to private account. Just one another feature which would do wonders is, allow to re-edit already uploaded reels, like cut or add any part of the reel. If it was technologically possible, Please try it. It will be great"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wish this app had dislike buttons. Going through reels there's a lot of hate that gets liked or misinformation that can't be checked by an utter dislike button. You can still drive controversial things to the top by using the number of interactions.

I have two accounts of which one doesn't get new features and if it does, that happens months after everyone else gets it. It's happening to a lot of people and it's very annoying. Media sharing quality sucks on Android compared to iOS. Photos from my phone look like something from the 2000s once uploaded. What I don't get is, if billions of people use this app and meta makes money off of it why aren't they actively fixing and improving it?"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app has so many glitches. I have been reported so many time in month. But Instagram never take it seriously they are careless about their customer that's why I am giving one star. And don't download this app

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram just blocked and removed my post trying to help someone quit smoking because I said message me in three days and tell me there's no nicotine in your system. The app is absolute trash. You can't even talk freely with your fellow human being without their ai attacking you. They block message requests even from your friends just because they feel like it. I hope they go bankrupt.

Also if you want to add more clips to what you previously uploaded, it re-adds what you previously uploaded in addition to new clips... Saving a post to a collection, crashes the app each time.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Always buggy and slow. Rarely get a successful upload first time. Incredible that a brand as massive as meta can curate something so poorly. Was 2 stars and they asked me to update. Well as I now can't add images from my gallery then I guess the only way is down. Hate the app and will delete as soon as our trips over. The works would be better without Instagram.

I don't want to do it but it never stops trying to remind me to do things that I don't even want to do. When I do try to do it it's impossible to get through any of it because it's so complicated. Figure it out Instagram engineers and simplify it so that people who don't spend all day on Instagram can actually make something meaningful without taking forever to learn how. K.i.s.s.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was way better before Now it shows reels thar I already chose not interested. If I want to refresh reels I have to swipe up to the first reel to do so not as before were I just have to press the reel icon to do it for me. I am waiting for the next update. If these issues not fixed im am uninstalling jt.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram algorithm is poor. I've added ""Taylor Swift"" to the words/phrases list to no longer be suggested that content. I am inundated with her on my newsfeed. Consistently for the past three months I've hidden posts and gone through the not interested prompts. The algorithm is a joke and doesn't reflect the user ."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"""caption"" is not a feature in our app yet I see people on YouTube explain how to use it. Also, after 2 rows of text then editing text on time line is no longer possible. Too many bugs in this app. Your algorithm sucks as well. I get 5 times the amount of engage on TikTok and reach the right audience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"- good in keeping up with trends along with Tik Tok, good for watching reels as entertainment as well as viewing other users profile - the editing feature inside is horrible, I clearly remember I made a 9-13 seconds reel, Instagram took so long to upload it, I wasted my time editing it only to find out that it extended to a 5 minute reel, the reel began to go haywire. Terrible editing feature included inside the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Having issues viewing stories and reels. Once I click and view a story or reel it is the only one that continues to load even when selecting thumbnails for other stories and reels. Closing and reopening app only restarts the cycle. Using Samsung note 10.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has so many inexcusable bugs! Garbage! Won't load camera roll anymore. The chat is almost unusable, plus the post editor randomly reverts your photo edits and changes aspect ratios etc. I don't know what happened, these ridiculous problems never used to be there. How embarrassing for such a large developer."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Full of fun and entertainment but one thing is very annoying for me that it takes some minutes, sometimes even hours to a message to be sent. I tried everything to fix the issue but in vain, I reinstalled it, updated it and cleared the cache but nothing worked. Please fix the problem.üôèüèªüôèüèª"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram keeps getting worse after every new update. Isn't the whole point of an 'update' is to make the app more smooth in running for the users? It's quite the opposite here. I will gladly come back and fill up the remaining 2 stars once your team sorts out all the annoying bugs.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Hey I've been facing an issue since last week and it really sucks Instagram doesn't show more than half of my photos from gallery I can't upload any photos like this it only shows some recent photos of last 3 days plus it shows some specific albums not my camera roll or card pictures please fix this bug its really annoying !

Dreadful! 06/02/2024 and now it doesn't show me friends posts at all, just suggested. Honestly this app has become awful..."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been great up until the last few days, now every time I try to post a picture it gets flipped upside down in the preview and caption screens then comes up with an error and won't upload. Not on the beta trial and haven't changed anything."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of worst experiences ever nowadays. Today i just opened the app, out of nowhere it pops out that ""your account was compromised"". I was like what happened, then i said maybe an issue from my side, i thought let's do whatever it asks. I changed the password as per the instructions. Later, i'm not being allowed to like, comment on any post. Like for real? Is this what you call an experience? I tried re-installing the app. Now again i'm being asked to change password. Please resolve this asap."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cell ph camera pictures & videos are not supporting in Instagram feed & reel. And always saving pictures & videos are not showing as a recent folders. What's the problem in this app? Before it's working nice..In 2024 January-15th suddenly facing problem.. I'm always updating this app & still now do it. But Instagram app can't give me any solutions..!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love creating and editing videos, but now when I add texts to my videos, they completely disappear, and I can't edit them. I have to restart the editing process all over, and it's continuously happening each time. Getting very discouraging üòû"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is a world and have everything, its almost perfect but if there were a option to hide the like, comments share or other things from the reels while watching with just one tap it would be more engaging and make people stay longer on the app. Also it will be just like a movie to us. For the watchers..!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"horrible. anytime im on a call with someone, instagram randomly closes and makes me leave the call. then when i try to open the app again and join back, it crashes another 3 times. only way for me to call again is if i end the call and try all over again. its an annoying process and a waste of time"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly new bugs that never cease. Also extremely biased about what content they will take down and what they won't, even though my content doesn't violate guidelines and I appeal, they still keep it down. It has a lot of potential. However, with all the downsides, I'd have to say that overall it is extremely disappointing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app experiences multiple mandated updates now...yet still manages to crash and not back up data. Never been a fan of social media and this just solidifies that for me. However I like the connections it brings and the people you come across.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like everything on the app except for one thing and that is to why android users don't usually get the same features as those who are ios users like the music on the noted feature which I find really cool but got disappointed when I didn't have it due to my phone. I just hoped that it will be fixed some day.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Second week of January and it has lost the ability to allow permissions to my camera roll. In early January when using the app it jumps from using a few gb of storage to 54 gb, then maxing out to exceeding my phones capacity entirely. To use the phone I have to uninstall the app entirely üòë I was a heavy user but to install and uninstall multiple times a day is ludacris."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's going on with this app? It doesn't let me choose photos from SD card and it doesn't save uploaded photos to device. I couldn't log in to another account, it says it doesn't exist even if it does exist. Seriously, your app is defective! Fix it at once!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, i don't want to give a single star because I'm using this app for the past 2 years, but i still haven't found anything interesting because there are too many glitches and it asks for update every time, after opening the app it stuck in 1 place. I found it totally distracted. Unhappy with instagram, it never takes your complaints, and there are so many people who are opening fake accounts of your instagram id, but instagram does not take any action. ü´§"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's always something with this app. Having issues with this app is annoying because making help reports go nowhere. I'm not convinced they have anyone working on user support. The option feels like a security camera that doesn't record, it's just there for the illusion."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Please fix the damn bug. I am unable to find the reel icon or even scroll through the reels on my feed. It's very frustrating. Tried to re-install/ update. It's not helpful. Edit: I am finally able to watch reels. Thank you.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very difficult to find photos on the phone, 'Recents' are anything but, recent photos are impossible to find. If I resort to navigating to my Photos album on android it will only permit one to be selected. Increasingly poor functionality."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, it's a good app. I only have one issue that seems like a simple fix(not a cs major). I really don't like the gif/sticker relpies on posts in the comment section, but I love to scroll and read/reply in the comments. They also slow my phone down a lot, which is annoying. I then found the setting that turns off gif comments on posts, but the issue is that it only works on your own posts/comments; I don't want to see gif/sticker replies on any comments on any posts. 5* If this is fixed!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's really frustrating to post pictures. If they're not the exact dimensions the app wants, they will automatically be cropped or distorted. Pinching or panning the grid is useless and changes absolutely nothing at all, you are instead stuck with what instagram crops them as."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was perfectly fine for until they changed the ""black"" dark mode to a ""blue"" tinted dark mode. I did not think it would bother me at first, but it is surprisingly brighter at night and just makes the app look unappealing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If there was an option for zero stars thats what i would rate this stupid app, i was logged out of Instagram and they kept asking to log in on a former device, which is stupid because why would you need an old device to log into an app, everytime i put my phone number in it would tell me it could not send a link. When i try to contact instagram it sent me through a ridiculously long process that didnt even work in the end. This app needs a better customer support because what even is this."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram won't recognize photos from SD Card. It's been super frustrating having to move images from my SD Card to Internal storage just to post something!

There's now a duplicate ""Older posts"" link next to the""Suggested Posts"" heading which does the same thing.

Please fix!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have been using Instagram from a long time now and all of a sudden I'm unable to see my camera or SS card photos when trying to put a story or post a photo. I don't know if it's a glitch or a bug but only with me and not with anyone else. I reported this problem to Instagram but till now no update from them.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I recently encountered a glitch on the Instagram app where it displays the ""unmute story"" option, even though I haven't muted the story in the first place. I'm keen on muting it, but unfortunately, the app isn't letting me. Hoping for a fix soon!"

Please solve this problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Frankly, it's just not that great. For an app of this age, it's clunky and not intuitive. It's popular because it's popular. If this were a brand new app that didn't have name recognition, and billions of dollars behind it, it wouldn't find success. I wish people would stop supporting apps with such poor design. Especially when they show no interest in improving the bad design."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not been able to add captions with reels or comment on my posts or anyone else's for that matter for the past 2 days. I've reported the issue over and over again and still not had any resolve. Never had this happen before so disappointed its happening and can't get hold of a real human to help fix the issue.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is full of glitches. The feed doesn't refress most of the times. Once you pin a post there is no option to unpin. Messages in DMs get send twice. Random people whose profiles I have never even seen are present in my follow list. Please improve the application.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Add Yours sticker is fixed. Now, loading photos from the phone's storage isn't. Photos/videos auto load when it's taken with the camera feature inside the application. I just want to load photos taken by my phone and just edit it inside the app. It sucks."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love instagram but right now, its getting annoying. When I tried to post a photo on my story, the size of the photo changed. It doesn't go the way I want it to be. It doesn't let me post a photo that was saved on my external storage as well. As of now, the app is giving me a hard time. Please fix this!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried to post a photo but wasn't able to access my photos that are in my gallery. I reset permissions and have asked my other friends they are having the same issue. I have a samsung phone and I don't know if that does anything, but please fix this bug. I also un-installed it and installed it back, and it is still the same."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Garbage app. For the past few months I could not see anything from my camera roll/gallery to do a post on Instagram. Thinking it was maybe my S22 Ultras fault Ididn'tt bother. I just upgraded to the S24 Ultra, and yet again, the same issue is occurring! This isn't a phone problem at this point and is an app issue. Fix your app Instagram!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was working really fine until its latest update DMs are not working properly whenever I recieve a DM after seeing it again it's popped up as unseen and it's also not able now to send DMs instantly despite the best Internet speed ,clearing cache , restarting the phone and even reinstalling the app again and again has not resolved the issue."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Update to add - I'd really like a way to repost stories I'm not tagged in i.e. from a popular creator I follow. One change I'd like to see would be to have one page on profiles for just photos. So many times I click on a post on someone's main page and it's a reel instead of a photo - just a minor annoyance.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please fix the issue of where the app keeps automatically resetting the feed. It's extremely annoying while you're on the phone with somebody or reading, etc, and it changes the feed, so you basically miss out on a lot of posts/reels."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Get rid of the forced next reel watching. I'm trying to rewatch a reel and I'm forced to move onto the next one after my first rewatch because instagram is trying to brainwash people into being addicted to their app and ruin their attention spans. Let me watch a reel as many times as I want without forcing me to move onto the next reel. It's not asking for much besides basic human decency to not do everything in your power to brainwash myself and others to be addicted to your app for ad revenue.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to work okay, but since last update I cannot access pictures from my SD card, meaning I cannot upload any pictures with an app that only has video and pictures. Reading other reviews it seems that other Android users also have this problem, how was this not tested and how has this been going on for weeks? This ain't an amateur app or a solo developer app. Ridiculous."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Has way too many bugs. It freezes after going back once. The dark mode takes it too literally and makes even the letters black so the whole screen is black except the pic or reel. You can't even upload a story in peace without it bugging. Its way too annoying
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since I have been meta verified my collaborators are not receiving a request when i send it. I have contacted Instagram and they just give you a copy- paste answer and ignore the problem. They tell me it's a glitch. Sort out the app! This is just getting worse, I never used to have issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has everything! Awesome pictures, cool videos, AND communication features (DMs and video and voice calls. It's a great app and I personally enjoy posting and watching reels. I haven't had any problems so far, so from where I stand now, Instagram is a great app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I think this is better for photos and images than Facebook. It also seems to have less scammers and false info. There's too many tools and hacks available to Facebook users who claim to be developers who only use it for illegal purposes. There doesn't seem to be as much of that with Instagram so it seems to be cleaner......"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty good, i dont get any if the acounts i follow on my reels page, which id like to see more of. i rarely see any of their content, and also the option to change/add pronouns is just completely gone. i had the ability to add them a while back but now i cant edit them at all. hopefully this gets fixed soon"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to work so well. First it started where I could see what people texted me to Now this: it doesn't even let me use it, I can't text nor call. And the app doesn't even want to open it just says refresh this page, and then it goes to a white screen and then a button appears saying cancel."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DMs dont load. I checked my internet connection and everything is working well. Everytime i try to open my dms i see blank screen for 5 minutes before all my dms could appear. Its been 3 months like this. Now I can't send messages but I'm still able to send reels. The messages keep loading. Insta is getting worse over time!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Okay, let's talk about ads. I'm not the type to care about ads here and there, but this is ridiculous. Two ads for every two stories you watch, seriously??? Much less actually scrolling posts! Half my feed is ads I don't care about, and at this point I'm blocking every account and reporting every ad as spam so you have to do more work and experience this frustration yourselves. You're a multi-billion $ company, there is no reason for this excessivness."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I also disappointed. When I update the app 2 days later my account will disable and show that you enter your some information. When I enter my mobile no. It says that they will send a code.but they don't send.when I touch the re send option they show error and say we will send after 24 hours .till that they doesn't send the code
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like thise app very much . But there is problem some time and for solve that problem it take more than 1 to 2 months .

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The fact that you keep changing how the app and algorithm works everytime is really discouraging. Creatives get confused on how to go about posting everyday. Instagram is now so complex and as it is, being a creative is already complex enough üò©...we just might be forced to look for alternatives that gives results at per with effort put into creating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App has been having a constant issue with viewing your own story after you've posted the pictures. It says you haven't posted anything, and then when you post something new, it acts like that's the only picture you've posted to your story."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been using this app for years, but with my new phone (LG Velvet) I don't get any current updates. The camera isn't formatted right. The app will sometimes freeze while doing basic functions. Today I keep getting a pop up window that glitches my whole screen. I hope to hear back from the support team."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so unbelievably bad. I had an account before Facebook bought and merged everything and it somehow got unlinked from my email. Despite still being linked to my phone number, it's ""not able to send an sms to recover my password due to my security settings."" None of the other recovery options have worked after clicking help links and going in circles for hours. Then I decide to just make a new account using my original email since my old account was unlinked, and it won't let me. Trash."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been updating no.of times. My account hasn't in an updated version. After updating also. It's not been able to forward any messages and I can't send any react to the messages using emoji. Theme formate is also not working. Number of times I'm updating this app ,but I can't see any changes in it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For no apparent reason this app eats up 8GB of storage on my phone every time I make a reel. I have to wipe the app storage and reset my app settings every time to make sure I don't run out of storage on my phone after making a few reels!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall its good app... But Meta should be updated to delete multiple message option like on insta, messenger etc. Its 2023 going to be end but they didn't changed this option. If we want to delete single text on messenger we have to press 4or 5 times. Its time consuming and feels like awkward.In my point of view, Thats why messenger is not getting worth and acceptable among the people. It should be simple and less time consuming. Thanx"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately, this app's riddled with glitches. DMs linger on ""sending,"" messages stay unseen even after opening. The request bar falsely signals new messages. Suddenly, almost 200 followers vanished, but reporting brought back 100. As a beginner, every follower matters, making this Instagram experience pathetic."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Still one of the best platforms out there but it's increasingly vague what Instagram wants from it's creators and what it has to offer visitors. Posting frequency, type of contect etc is leading to annoying clickbait content instead of quality."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They do not allow partial nudity as well and are willing to suspend you if you do. It's ridiculous, but it is still getting there in regards to better improvements in customization. Still, they need to keep track of hackers and schemer's who offer you something with them only to rob you at the end."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Beware security bug - app sharing videos in DMs without my consent - Meta won't help. For the last few months the app has randomly been sharing videos from my device to differ over recently spoken to in DMs. I've tried reporting them and nothing. I paid to be verified so I'd be able to contact support (hoping meta would care about this security concern!) and was told it would be escalated but a month later it's still happening, and they are just fobbing me off. This app isn't safe."

My advice, do not create an artist account under your artist name and do not add a 2 factor identification security system because they will lock you out and never give you back your account. By the way, I've attempted to contact the app support many times and zero response. Been almost 1 year. Amazing customer service for a billion dollar app. (Of course that's sarcasm)"

Secondly the music option is not showing on the carousels. My account is private."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been around for years, & there's still no edit comment option. If someone reports your comment as spam, & you try to tell Instagram, it's a mistake by selecting that option, Instagram won't do anything. All I get is a ""check your internet connection"" message. There's nothing wrong with my internet connection. They just don't investigate these things. Which is annoying. They also will revoke your ability to comment if you comment too much on a post. Which makes no sense."

There should be more options for situations like this, not just a horribly done selfie portrait. I don't have any photos of myself, but this is just bad practice on their part. We need more ways to get back our accounts. 1 star."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,PRO: The user interface aka ui is good. Didn't learn it as easily as learned as unreal engine user interface in 2004 but enough for a person my age can pick up. CONS: Dont really care for people uploading my contact information to the web. Not like the world is really safe right now and its kinda invading my privacy in a way. I cannot consent to legal terminology in the use of service because they used the app before me. Now my info is stolen. So thanks meta. I practice law too.
