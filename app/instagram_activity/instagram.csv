I can only schedule posts through my tablet. Also, boosting barely works. I reach maybe two more people than usual when I boost when the promise is up to 100. The other problem is the algorithm. If you are an up-and-coming artist, it's extremely hard to gain traction and have it stick. Other than that, it's a good app if you're not using it as a business account."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Instagram and think it has some great qualities. However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! ü§¶
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so glitchy when it comes to posting story or on feed. It use to work fine but for the past 3 months it's a hassle to post anything. I've officially stopped even trying to post stories or anything since the app crashes or the screen goes black everytime I try to post it. When I try to post 1+ pics, the layout can't be changed, I can't search for more filters. When I try to post on feed, the order and edit and filters don't work. Fix the issues. It's genuinely irritating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some bugs just piss me off...it's not that they don't get fixed after someday but in every update there's a new issue and hey for sure I love this app and never has a thought crossed my mind to deactivate my account...I have been using this platform ever since I got my first smartphone (6 years ago) and it has gone through its ups and downs. I am leaving a 4-star rating because after the lockdown started Instagram changed dramatically and is still making changes. Thanks, Instagram forever more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Starting a few versions back, I'm not able to reproduce reels sent by Whatsapp or any other app. When I click on the link, Instagram opens up in the reels but in black screen and video is never reproduced. Please note that I'm able to open the link to post, this issue only happens with reels. UPDATE: A few weeks back the issue was solved."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of my stories in my archive aren't there anymore. They just disappeared. Some of the stories in my archives, I also put in my highlights. They're not in my highlights, either. I don't know what bug this is but random stories from both my archive and highlights have been disappearing randomly. Please fix this. Edit (Apr. 2, 2024): Same problem. My recent stories that happen to be my favorites are GONE! This is NOT okay!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reels are great. Checking out posts are great, but I've been having this same ongoing issue with being able to listen to voice messages sent to me. I've reported it and updated the app. Given all the possible permissions I can give, but it still doesn't work. And it's stupid."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the new update I can't create reels or stories. It bugs 9 times out of 10. Been trying to identify how to reproduce the bugs 100% but I can't. It's a nightmare. Can't edit videos in reels, can't use templates, can't mix sounds... and reels have been pushed my instagram for the last 4 years. Insane. Stories bug if I try to out text in them when recording a clip from InstaStories. Considering uninstalling. Need a bugfix ASAP"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's starting to be less fun. I use the app mostly for family, friends, and looking at sports highlights, food, and comedy. The notification icon will say I have notifications, but then it's all ""suggested for you"" but most of the ""suggested"" are accounts where we dont have any friends in common. and mostly spam accounts. Also you can only pause notifications for 8 hours. After that there will be messages and what's in them going across the screen. Tried to turn it off or pause, but no."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram isn't what it used to be anymore. I've been using this app for years and years back it worked perfectly fine. There never were issues but since updates kept coming and certain things changed, there's constantly issues (that are rather annoying) popping up. Such as the inbox not working properly. Having to refresh in-app for messages to appear. Not being able to post or change pfp without the app closing itself, stories acting up weird, etc. kinda dissapointing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the latest update, reels cannot be fast forward nor can you rewind without it freezing or stopping or just fully restarting the video, sometimes even refreshing the entire thing so your reel is gone! The worst feature in my opinion is that it tries to skip to the next reel, *WHILE* you are WATCHING the one you're on! Sometimes I enjoy repeating the video or I'm busy looking at the comments. It is so incredibly frustrating and upsetting. I hate the new update."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: videos won't post now?! scheduled post?Gone! So many updates, and yet this app just gets worse and worse! Trying to save drafts is impossible! It NEVER saves. Makes you start all over again. It's honestly very discouraging. Posting a quick video shouldn't be so difficult. Instagram needs an entire new development team. You guys are continuously dropping the ball. A lot of people use this app and you guys got egotistical and thought it was perfect....it's very, very far from that."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been trying to scroll through my followed accounts to find a particular one and every few seconds it automatically scrolls back to the top. It's unusable. Not to mention if you leave the app for even a second it refreshes the feed and you lose whatever you were looking at. I know it's on purpose so you get distracted and spend more time on the app but I can't even use it for what I want anymore.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be a fantastic app if the bugs were fixed. Everytime I attempt to log in to an account and error message pops up. I've tried resetting my passwords, opening my accounts from the website, and trying to log in through email links but nothing has been working. The lack in quality when posting an image is also very irritating. This app would definitely bring more people in if the ones behind it fixed the issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the update I am not able to navigate the timestamp bar at the bottom of reels. It's very irritating because often time I'd want to may be share a video and show a specific information in that video and that feature helped me to watch the video from between or from any timestamp I want. Now just vanishes as soon as I click on that thin bar. Please fix this, what's the point of having it if I cannot move forward/backward in a video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is just falling apart. Over emphasis on stories, random updates that change the layout/interface with no explanation on the changes, every version of the app appears to be different, video quality seems to have dropped since the recent update, the algorithm is awful and assumed that because you see something once that's all you want to see. Instagram, stop with the updates and just make this a simple app again"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It seems there's a glitch where the bar at the bottom where I used to be able to fast forward to go to a specific spot in the reel isn't allowing me to do this anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch or if that feature was removed. But it is impacting my experience with Instagram pretty negatively because I don't want to have to watch the whole reel from the beginning if I want to see a specific part of the video.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app and its features are also very good . But for some family issues , I uninstalled the app and when I reinstalled it and tried to log in to my existing account , the loggin page showed a notification that something error happened. I tried many times after that by reinstalling it , but every time it showed the same. Are you aware of this ? If not then please do something that can solve this matter . Thank you üôèüôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update is really messing with the app. Anytime I try to fast forward or rewind a reel, it freezes and I have to exit the video completely, needs to be fixed. Also, whenever I try to edit a highlights cover photo, the photo will flip strangely, or it will glitch and zoom in on a part of the cover photo when saving the changed highlight cover."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible commenting system. It only serves to promote hate and fuel anger and it's clearly done on purpose to drive ""engagement"". Old: I wish there was more control over when it refreshes/auto-scrolls to the top :/ Old: It's pretty frustrating to use. The video player functions don't really work - they also removed landscape as an option, as far as I can tell."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Posting here for dev attention. A fine app, it does what it does, except recently there have been some UI issues. On my S23 Ultra, I enter the Reels section of the app, and if I try to interact with any of the interface buttons around the edge of the screen, the app becomes largely unresponsive and locked up, needing to be closed and restarted again. At the moment it's making that big section of the app almost entirely unusable. And worst of all, it's impossible to contact any support about this"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is an unfathomable mess. It is flooded by scam bots that Instagram seemingly can't get a handle on, but constantly deleting regular comments as spam is totally possible. UI elements are constantly moved around, your most messaged contacts suddenly appear at the bottom of the suggestions, sharing something to your story moves around in the list for share actions, the whole structure of the app gets redone every time there is a new feature they want to highlight, it is beyond annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Initially the app worked pretty well for me ,but after getting an update the reels are always out of sync with the audio.It takes a long time for me to post anything on my story and comments dissappear immediately after I post them.I hope the developers will fix the issues and the app will go back to normal. It's a 2 star rating for now till the bug is fixed"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've encountered difficulties resetting my password on this app, and the process seems to be a hassle. They claim they can't generate a reset link due to certain settings, leaving me stuck without a clear solution. It's frustrating when the purpose of credentials is defeated, making account security and login accessibility challenging. I'm quite disappointed with the experience. I request assistance with password reset issue as I have checked all the help center solution and nothing work for me."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure why, but all of a sudden I can't use direct messages. I can send it, but after I do, the error message ""Message Unavailable: This message type isn't currently supported"" pops up & all of my messages can't be seen. They're just gone. Idk if this is my account or the app? But it's very frustrating. I've tried several things that i googled to fix it & still nothing. & I'm not the only one having these types of issues. Please help me figure it out & fix it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Instagram Explorer page completely messed up all of a sudden and stuff that I have never even encountered or interacted with is showing up on my feed. spent days trying to fix the algorithm and clicking on 'not interested' on each of those posts and even telling the algorithm to remove posts with those certain keywords but it's just not fixing or changing anything. it's been this way for months now. even reinstalled the app, tried vpn, complained to support center but no response and no fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IG has possibly the worst interface I've ever experienced. There is a progress meter at the bottom, but if you try to use it, the video pauses permanentlt. Mute? Permanent pause. Any kind of interaction but scroll up or down? (Which restarts the video) Start from zero. I give up. Jesus people, test the garbage you write before using it to sell my data."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Reel editor freezes every time I want to edit a video. When I finally got through it, the video wouldn't post (may have been my wifi so ok on that one). I deleted the app to see if the bugs were just from a previous version of the app. When I reinstalled it I couldn't get into my account without 2 factor auth, and the support page was buggy and wouldn't let me submit a support ticket. So frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I noticed some of my stories are missing from my archives, especially 3 out of 4 from 4/13. After updating and logging out of, and then, back into the app, the 3 appeared the archives. But the 1 that was previously showing is no longer there. I'm tired of having stories missing from the archives!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The home feed autorefresh is out of control. If I set my phone down and the screen turns off or I look at any other app, it refreshed. Sometimes it refreshes my feed because I look at comments for more than a minute. It's an absolutely terrible user experience that you can't turn off the excessive automatic refreshing. Ypu can't even see the posts from people you follow because it's nonstop refreshing the feed. It's been an issue for some time and Meta just doesn't care to LET US TURN IT OFF."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It won't let me into my other account since I changed my phone number. It keeps saying that it's going to send a verification code to my new number and nothing happens. I almost got scammed trying to contact someone about it! Be more accessible when people have issues with the app!!! UPDATE: It still won't let me in. Offers to take a selfie video, great, and then asks for a password. Guess what? Doesn't accept any passwords. No one has gotten back to me to help."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I came back after being disgusted with Tik Tok and YouTube shorts. It is still dismal. They constantly try to get you to watch reels, which is super annoying. I also posted something, and it was immediately buried. Imagine trying to show your friend a picture on your phone, but somebody grabs your phone from your hand and puts one hundred photos on your phone that your friend has to scroll through to see your photo."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Stop moving the Link Copy option every other day!!! HATE where you buried the option to copy a link or share. So annoying! I have friends that stay on the app throughout the day because we constantly share links. We could do it quickly with the old format. Too many steps now mean we will spend less time on the app! We have tried it today. Massive FAIL! So unbelievably annoying and time consuming. I use the app less and so do friends when we can't find the copy link option to forward something.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever new update they rolled out is awful. Specifically on reels. The buttons don't work anymore, you'll press share and it'll bring you to the creator's profile, comments and it'll pause and become non-responsive to touch. The UI is horrible for such a common app. Did you hire children to complete the coding? There's a new auto-scroll feature that I blame for it - and who needs it? I can scroll on my own, I don't need the phone to dictate when I'm done on a certain video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since jan 2024 there's an intermittent use of using the slider on the reels to fast forward or rewind. Was on a pixel 7 Pro, reinstalled and still persisted. Now I'm on galaxy s24 and it's still doing it. Worth. Voting I think it glitches if you tap and pull to fast forward and then leave the video and go back to it and the sliders gone. Probably designed to force you back into the infinit scroll. Go fys"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't log in, says I shared my password and never did, tried to change password which I cannot remember, when choosing forgot password it will not let me enter my email, just brings me back to the same page saying I shared my password!! Wth .... I have uninstalled several times and chged any setting I can think of! Really pissed I can't access or change my own information!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app just keeps getting WORSE. Not only do I always have issues sending messages to people (stuck on ""sending"", I have to reinstall the app to fix) but now I can't even forward reels without it freezing and glitching. What is going on with the dev team?! Do you guys not test the software before publishing updates? Unreal!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Instagram experience for me is what used to be not a big fan of, recently changed ,as I realized how many awesome photo filters there is on here! Wow amazing filters for everyday photos you can edit, save, delete, whatever . Not to mention it's a very good way,as is Facebook, to connect to basically anyone in a convenient quick fashion."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm extremely annoyed by this app. Generally it is a good way to interact but lately it's become so frustrating. I'm in process of watching a short video then bam, screen goes to sleep. Now, I first thought it's my mobile device but it's not as no other app does this. Not even FB. I've checked all the IG settings can't find anything to extend or turn it off. Please fix this nonsensical display."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since Jan 2024, follow button is just white and nothing inside, can't navigate videos anymore (fastforward or rewind, bar is there initially but if you click it stops and can do nothing about it), memory leak with app (uses immense resources and continuously increase memory usage and CPU requirements), image quality dropped on videos and pictures in multi-posts (after 1st posted image or video). Still, after months, no way to select all saved posts and unsave all simultaneously. App needs debug."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last two updates I have been unexpectedly logged out of my account so many times. At first I thought my account was getting hacked but now I think it's the app it self, thought updates was to make the app better not worse but it keeps happening for no reason. I'll be on it then I'll get an error message then I'm logged out. Please fix tired of it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram is the biggest social media platform but still it can't handle 4k and HD videos. I mean my hd videos always get laggy after posting them and I don't the why. I hope they fix this as soon as possible and they also need to focus on the quality improvement. This is my only problem with Instagram. Also I hope they bring back IGTV. I don't know why they removed it at the first place. Soo now even a long video is converted into a reel and it's not ok for various reasons.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Settings do not actually change anything. Turned off notifications from people liking comments. Those notifications still pop up. All the time. What's the point of giving the option to change settings if they don't actually change the settings Edit: still hasnt changed. New though, somehow while scrolling, I got logged out entirely??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Disappointing... Deleted my account without notifying me...

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It now won't refresh my feed, not can i access comments. The app doesn't give me an option to turn the volume up or down when sharing songs from spotify to my story.

Every new update to this app makes it more of a hellscape, it's the dumbest social media app that's out right now. I only use it for art and the algorithm is a nightmare. Just don't waste your time, even tiktok is better than this right now.

My wife and I use an account that the app keeps telling us doesn't exist, despite it being shared, verified, and active for years. Now that I got a new phone, I can't access the account and the normal login methods appear to be broken. Simple two factor options don't work despite all steps being followed. The lack of support is a bit surprising and we are unsure where to go at this point."

This is happening only in my account and I tried Logging in through other android phones still the same problem. Fix this glitch at the earliest. I mailed the support team also still no response.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely no help from instagram when an account is hacked. The account has now been completely taken over by hackers. Reported multiple times and it hasn't been taken down. The log in details were all changed before being able to confirm in an email that it wasn't the person's account. 7 days later, the account is still up and is clearly a scam account now. Also, having top comments pop up on instagram reels is really annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The reel audio mute/unmte button has suddenly been removed. Now clicking the reel simply stops or starts the video.

Also, pinned posts no longer have a pin icon on them which is very confusing!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a Social Media app. It works as intended, however, since Facebook bought it, you can't post anything political, (right wing) or risk losing your page. I have been tagged as ""Spam"" many many times. Couldn't comment for a bit. I doubt this will be rectified, but it would be nice if it was. Also, reporting pages that actually are offensive does nothing, as nothing is done. + IG needs constant updates, but hardly anything changes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been working fine up until recently. As other reviews have mentioned, whenever I try to rewind a video/reel, it completely freezes so I have to exit out of the video and open it again. When I open the video again, the option to rewind is then gone. Please fix this. It's frustrating and tedious."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My phones notification bar shows up when I'm using the story editor, and it will not go away unless I exit the story editor. This is a problem because I'm unable to see if my picture or video is fully expanded to fit the screen and also it's fairly distracting when I'm trying to focus on editing"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's a severe problem with the account recovery service for this app. If you get logged out, in my case randomly, there's a chance you'll not be able to get back in when the recovery emails DO NOT send. This is a serious problem that considering the size of Meta should not be happening. Terrifying to think of that happening to users who may have their revenue tied to using the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,There is a bug I believe on the saved collection. I've got more than 6 collections but when you go to the collection it shows only 6 and it's not scrolling down to check the rest. You will have to create empty one so it expands and then you can check. But when you save a post from your home page it shows all the collections but not when you goto saved collection
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has gone from my favorite social media to I don't even want to open it anymore. To force an auto play to the reels without giving us an option to turn it off is ridiculous. Also, being automatically logged out without you doing anything to do so is dumb. IG is slowly dying, and these past updates have given it a violent shove into its grave."

Edit: photos get cut and shifted weirdly as I'm on last stage of edit! And spent probably an hour creating a reel, pressed 'share' to post it.... and it won't! ""There seems to be a problem""! And it's nit getting saved into drafts at this point! You can't save it to try to post it again! No! All you work and time goes to drain!! Disguising!"

Not to forget the snail speed rollout of HDR videos and photos support on android. Dear Meta, please employ a few people to work on the android app, after all these years this is unacceptable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please make sure your REGULAR functions work. Dark mode is wonky, doesn't stay dark. Texts can be hard to see sometimes. My instagram stories are getting misaligned after I post em. Some people's videos just randomly stop working. Why are these small things issues?? Do NOT bring new functions here. It is easy to understand how quickly these small things ruin the overall impact and enjoyment of the app. Been on here since 2017, it gets worse often"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but the latest update is literally eating up alot of battery. I use it on my S24 Ultra, before the update it consumed 5% for an hour's use (reels, editing, messaging) but after the update it sucks up 10% for an hour's use. Other apps drain the battery normally. And all of this is happening in foreground. Waiting for the newer version that will fix this."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not working. Started here recently with lagging and not being able to use the time slider. Or trying to rewind or fast forward would make the video stop. Now, this morning it just doesn't show anything. No videos, no pictures, nothing. Just black. All my other apps work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Notifications keep coming way later or not at all. Sometimes they only show up AFTER I open the app. Have to constantly refresh chat to see messages people sent otherwise they don't show. Doesn't always show all the messages a person sent. Also blocking someone doesn't block all the other accounts they make. I AM GETTING NO NOTIFICATIONS
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's too many glitches. It needs to get fixed. I uninstalled and installed the app twice and nothing. I can't refresh my reels, I can't open my messages without the app glitching. I can't even see my following without the app going back to the top. I've been using this app for years! Fix it please."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to try the new feature to limit a post to a specific audience. Unfortunately, this option is nowhere to be seen, despite the app being up-to-date, etc etc. My friend has it, though. We both have Android devices. I tried to find an answer online, and it seems that a lot of people have this same issue. Disappointing."

If you guys are unabke to provide new features just leave it as it is, dont remove existing features. For example a job notification is posted how to identify weather the post is new one or posted a week ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You won't stop asking for a review. So fine. Posts glitch. Reels are broken for my viewers and break less than 20 seconds in. Constantly clips and crops my images so I have to sacrifice size and quality to make anything fit within your stupid grids. Not only that but you have LEGITIMATELY no way of contacting customer support about actual issues; I've reported a scam product for more than 6 months and no one can find anything wrong with a product that's actively causing health concerns. Ok.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm sick and tired of our much this app refresh. If you say on one page too long and your screen goes off, no matter how fast you unlock it, it refreshes the whole app, and you start over. Plus, whenever you leave a comment, you no longer get to see it in a paragraph format. It's just one long page, and it's hard as hell to proof before you submit it, then you see it. Whatever they did to this app, it truly stinks."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a great platform & I'm loving it! The new features make sharing photos and stories even more fun and interactive. Plus, the interface is sleek and user-friendly. If you're into social media, definitely give Instagram a try üëç"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram is becoming unsafe for most of it's users. It gets compromised so easily. For hackers it is so easy to hack whereas for users it appears as if it is highly secured. After account getting hacked there is hardly any support from Instagram. Soon it will be the next orkut.

So many accounts are being restricted for various reasons, such as being told they are commenting, liking, and following too much. Makes absolutely no sense. Do better!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great platform. However super annoying when features outside the US are not available to everyone. Especially when we are following experts that are teaching us how to grow on here. e.g. Trending audios not available on creator accounts.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is incredible and all that... but I am unable to share other people's posts nor stories to 'my story'... It's 2024 and I'm still experiencing the same issue. There's no icon displayed for me that will allow me to share other people's stories... No matter how many times I have deleted and reinstalled the app...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love instagram but now it is all reels Instagram used to be about photos, I wish there was a filter function. Why have a all reels tab but not a only photos tab??? What's the use? Also, now the saved posts categories only shows the 5 most used catagories. If you want to go into a folder you have to save a photo into the category to make it most used, then you can access the category."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Automatic refresh is very annoying. If you put your phone down for a moment and want to come back to a story or a video you can't because of refreshes and then it's lost in Neverland. We're competent enough to refresh our own apps.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Backwards thinking Instagram. Again the ability to forward through reels has disappeared. I want that flexibility to forward through reels as an option. Otherwise I won't be watching any insta videos, therefore spending less time on your app."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE app. It keeps sayingg ""couldn't refresh feed"". It doesn't matter if I'm on data or WIFI, my connection is fine, I've tried clearing my cache and updating the app. This app is horrible I can't even view people's pages anymore or even look at the comments section. Its not my phone, its the app. FIX IT."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay. However, refusing to copy other platforms can make it better. Equally, an ever-changing algorithm, constant glitches, and a lack of originality make this platform extremely difficult to enjoy and grow. Even worse, at the time of this review, everything is Reels, Reels, Reels. This excludes individuals wanting to share images, etc. Long story short, it sucks. üò∂"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reels got broken, I can't scroll through the video to a point when INSTAGRAM INVOLUNTARILY REFRESHED my timeline so i got cut off from watching it. It's so frustrating, can you just not do it unless I SAY SO? goddamn it's not that hard. I can't scroll/skip the video because every tool/control disappeara and video freezes. I have to open it again and watch from the start."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is going down, if I didn't hold so many communications on this app I would never use it again. It just crashed for me and I can't log back in and before it crashed I wasn't able to look at any stories, reels or send messages. With every update it just gets worse."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty buggy. Cant press the rewind or forward bars on videos, or it freezes the vid or gets rid of the bar. Scrolling through time-line bugs out, and it misses features that should be basic, despite being one of the most popular apps. So weird."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is there no settings system built in? When I'm looking at reels and the reel is done, it automatically scrolls to the next video without my intervention. I think there should be a feature that prevents that from happening. It's so pointless to auto scroll."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not able to turn off auto scrolling when watching reels. At the bottom of the page it will pop up with ""next reel playing in"" and it is very annoying to have things I'm looking at disappear. So until this is fixed I'm using an alternative app to view Instagram and uninstalling the default app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram isn't letting me get into either of my accounts. I've reinstalled it on one of my devices, reset my password on 1 of my accounts, requested a log in link, tried to access it on my tablet.

Please try logging in again."", or ""We couldn't connect to Instagram. make sure you're connect to the Internet and try again."" Even when I am connected to the internet & I can't even contact them directly."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was working pretty well, but it was freezing a lot while trying to jump to different times in the video. That was fixed a bit ago but now you can not pause a video by tapping on it which was very convenient. You have to hold down which sucks after being able to just tap."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App has always been touchy & unintuitive. Coupled with the facts that you still can't reliably post from a browser on a computer & links aren't click able, Instagram is useless. I'm amazed it's popular at all with so many years-long limitations."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good one but there are few issues with d app & one of them which concerns me is- there should b some system or arrangement where we come to know that which effects are Instagram effects & which r 3rd party effects while making reels because most of the time when I try to boost d reel it gives me this message that it can't be boosted since d effects should be created by Instagram only. So there should be something which tells us about this since it takes a lot of hardwork for a reel.

I got hacked a couple years ago so got locked out I've tried resetting with a password as suggested and never could so there's a problem . I haven't been able to access my account in two years so deleting it .
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really think that Meta doesn't want Instagram to work fine. Whenever this application would start working fine without any glitch, the same moment you'll get an update which will again bring tens of bugs. Now after the last update, my Instagram is getting logged out automatically but not my other account which is also there. It has happened 10-12 times in last day. The second bug I'm facing is that songs are not playing for some of my posts even though song name is written there. Stupid app."

Give me a warning screen once I've pressed that button, or put it in the 'options part' when you've clicked the name. Top right corner should be to access a person's profile quickly from the chat.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Firstly I was unable to view anybody's vids or pictures sent in the chat which were taken by Instagram.. later on it even got worse and I couldn't see some of their pfp too.. and now it got to a point where it started showing 'error' and 'couldn't refresh page' and then later on when I though to delete this app and reinstall.. and when I tried to login my account it started showing 'an unexpected error occurred' I mean seriously!?
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know where to start, I hope the developer teams use IG themselves so they can understand more where to fix. Let's just start with the cropped reels. Recently the reels no longer show their full size & significant spaces cropped from original posted ones while users want to share the full details inside the reels."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the most recent update reels aren't functioning properly. The current reel will skip to an entirely random reel with no warning or confirmation. You also cannot return to the original reel, as pressing the back button returns you to the feed which automatically refreshes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Android app is failing to detect proper inputs such as opening comments when the share button is pressed (or anywhere on the screen is pressed for that matter) It's also operating very oddly such as showing comments for the previous video when a subsequent video has been scrolled to. Or simply doing nothing at all (rejecting all input when a button or region of the video is pressed to prompt an activity) Also commenting fails randomly without retry
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So the Meta AI features just showed up on my version of the app and they quite frankly suck. There's no option to disable the feature which is whatever until you scroll on your feed and the Meta search bar STAYS ON THE SCREEN. The chat bot set up for the AI also shipped with zero instructions - I tried asking it how it can be turned off and the first answer it always gave was ""press the three horizontal lines"" in the search bar or chat screen"" only for there to not be such a thing in either."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for social media, but it's extremely buggy. Skipping time in reels breaks the entire video, im unable to report or delete comments, Dms are malfunctioning too. Edit: Stop moving around buttons. I want posting to my story to be the first button I see for priority reasons. Not other social medias."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very good app for stress relief and mindfulness. But I want to give suggestion to Meta page that If I want to see the reel which I saw in previous days and it is not saved, why don't the instagram page can develop history based option which we can see same reels again currently."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are alot of bugs since I updated to the new version, and my ig feed can't be refreshed, and I can't log in to it, i can't see my text, Even if i try to log in from chrome it says an condition occurred, I am trying from many times, but I am not able to login, Instagram please fix this errors, I am going to depression please do something to it, as soon as possible, this is a request!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Posts and reels must be at least shared to all the followers. Also this is a place for creators. It seems that trending audios are pushed more easily than a different new one. I think background audio should bot be a criteria for pushing the video.

Never mind I was trying to post different vids. programmers should be shot. Round up the whole software development team and drown them in a sceptic tank. Not even joking.

Sometimes it doesn't save and it gives me another error message. Very frustrating."

Whenever I save a draft and I go back to edit the aspect ratio and positioning changes from what I selected, and it doesn't allow me to change it back. The quality of images and videos posted also severely diminishes that it looks as though you've used a really old phone. The app is certainly not as good as it once was. Do better instagram."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram figured out how to mess up their app again. Video play back now glitchs when you pause the video. Everything disappears and the play back now sucks.

I have not been given the option to use it while all of my friends have. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, turned my activity on and off, changed my account type back and forth, nothing works. Once I have notes I'll give a 5 star!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app used to be very good but for some reason my other account doesn't get any of the updates while my main does. I have also encountered a major problem which is that the top comments of any reels/posts are not showing and the sorting feature just disappeared. This problem is only on my main and It works normally how it used to on my alt. Please kindly take regard in this matter because it is very annoying not to see the top comments of any posts/reels.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"On the app only, when you click on the reactions in your notification list, it only takes you to the list of comments and not the photo. The problem doesn't happen with reels, only photos. The problem started last month. Web version doesn't have this problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the hashtag algorithm is horrible. you can only see top posts or ""recent"" top posts but they're not even recent. reels barely reach any audience most of the time if you're a small creator, and posts much less. now this new achievement feature: the 7 day story challenge resets whenever i get to the 7th day so i can never complete it also theres this 1 chat notification that wont dissappear, i did everything to get rid of it: checking messages, clearing cache, reinstalling instagram, etc."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No one has ever wanted to 'select' an Instagram comment. And somehow every time I'm scrolling through comments I select seemingly every comment and have to unselect...not user friendly!!

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent update has ruined the app. When posting multiple photos in stories, the Layout button just glitches and I get a black screen before eventually having to restart the app. Similarly, sometimes the app just freezes on messages and I have to, again, restart the app to access anything else."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For being the picture app, it sure does glitch a lot with Hella bugs and low quality videos and pictures whenever I send some to my friends. Messages get deleted so can't even retrieve memories/convos. When you try posting more than 2 items, the music glitches where you can't select the 15 second clip you want, it's stuck. A lot of issues and they deleted the funny GIFS. Other than that great app for friends and entertainment."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can you guys make an update on where the call/video button isn't so easily accessible? There are times when I accidentally click the button and have to tell the person I didn't mean to call them.

Frustrated."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a great app in my opinion. Every time I click on a shared post, I'm prompted to ""get the app"". If I try opening the app, it won't go to the shared link and I have to search manually - and maybe scroll through half a mile of someone's feed for a post that may not have been all that interesting in the first place."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a great social media app. Especially if you want to talk to friend and/or family. Instagram also has a lot of bugs and glitches.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever they've done to the algorithm has ruined it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used Instagram for a long time but stopped for a while, and I've recently decided to start using it again. Something I enjoyed doing was going to hashtags and finding small fan accounts of things I enjoy. But all that appears are ""top posts"" and ""recent top post"" literally the same post are on both and it's annoying. I want actual recent post back. Please bring it back. Explore doesn't always show recent post, it only does ""top posts/recent top post""."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a disgusting app, starting with the fact that it's just pointless and stupid in its essence, ending with an uncomfortable interface and constant account verification, where there are no photos, but you are asked not only to confirm your phone number with email, but also to take a video of yourself to ""confirm that I am a living person"". What is this, where is user privacy?"

Whenever I tap the forward button it shows me the names i can share to but when i tap on those name it keeps telling me that Instagram keep closing, Instagram not responding. It's too frustrating. My insta is updated and i don't know why this problem is coming. Get this correct as soon as possible."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The most buggy if all the sm apps. I can't save drafts, schedule posts, sometimes features are there and sometimes not. I got locked in a loop once where it wouldn't let me save or post a reel and I was just trapped until someone messaged me and I could click the notification."

I have at 2-3 accounts that I use for different reasons, one being an account I use to motivate and keep myself accountable for working out everyday, just yesterday I was able to switch over to it perfectly fine but today I can't switch to it and I can't even login to it as well. What is going on!!?? I don't understand, please explain.."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too much buggy while watching reels. The whole layout of reels changes, it clumps down at the bottom. Unresponsive buttons and most of the times shows comment section of previous reels. These bugs are not expected from the app with all the resources, crowd base and experience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is my favorite app in the whole wide world. We can post pictures,post videos, and message people. It makes you get closer with friends and family that you didn't see for quite a long time. It has a lot of memorable moments. I really really love Instagram and I think that I will never delete it ever. Hope this finds you well üíù"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time i refresh the homepage(/sometimes it refreshes itself) it gets rid of the stories and posts and just displays the 'welcome to Instagram' blank page that says 'when you follow people, you'll see the photos and videos they post here' but I am following lots of people? There's nothing I can do to make this go away once it happens."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest version can't access most recent photos or videos from my Android. The only way I can post a photo is to take a screenshot of the existing photo and modify it. It's the only way IG will find it. I haven't found a workaround for videos yet. Very frustrating!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All of a sudden, I'm unable to log in to my account. I disabled it a couple of months ago and wanted to enable it and log in again last night, and all of a sudden, I'm getting this error. It's ridiculous because instagram has absolutely no way of contacting support, so I can't even get someone to look at the problem for me. I guess my account is gone forever now."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update created more bugs/crashes. I can no longer post photos or even SEE my photos to post unless they are in an internal folder. The app keeps crashing, the UI for making posts (where you write captions) is tedious to navigate now. 0/10 stars, not a fan."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently, ""suggested posts"" now show up on your feed. Toggling the setting for this to snooze all suggested posts in feed does nothing. It's very annoying and makes the discover page redundant if suggested posts just appear everywhere else. Also makes following people useless as they no longer appear in your feed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Samsung Note 20 ultra user here. Since Jan 2nd I and many other instagram users (android & iphone) have been experiencing a problem with the app not showin pictures saved on our sd card. I run a fashion page and this is literally affecting my business. The lack of re-assurance from instagram is downright disrespectful. A ""We see the issue and are working on fixing it"" would save a lot of us stress."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is becoming very frustrating. The help centre contains tutorials on options that are NOT available in the app or desktop version. At least spare us from frying our brains and remove this help pages. Two of them would be: how to pin a post, how to create an event ..."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please fix this.. I cant log in any of my accounts because it couldn't recognize my username. My accounts doesn't have any issues, its the app itself. I dont want to change anything (ex: forgot password method) because I might permanently not get my account back on the process. I hope you'll look into it, as well as the other people who has their own concern/issues regarding the app. Thank you."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although a very good app to connect to people and explore the internet, it still has few flaws software wise, it doesn't give me access to few options, basically few options in the settings just disappeared, in my case it was account ownership and management settings. Please fix such issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This buggy app is not letting me view my followers. It gets stuck on the first 20 on the list and when I try to search the rest of the 800, it just keeps showing me the same accounts over and over. Literally can't access my 800 followers. Incredible. This wouldn't even be a problem if the algorithm wasn't showing me 5 same profiles over and over. I hate this app so much."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been for 7 years on Instagram still there's no strong security regarding our account i.e. post, stories.. I share is totally unsafe or not secure at all (anyone can see and reach unknowingly from any corner of the world). + 2Factor Authentication is a worst way to secure our accounts. Though it trouble to open same account on different phones however it opens even having a strong password. It seems that Instagram is making less effort for making everyone's account secure."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Instagram almost since its inception. Lately, the application can't find certain photos in my Gallery it appears selective. There is a work around the problem, but it's clunky. Suggest it be fixed if 5 stars are the feedback target."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Autoscroll to the top kills the experience, I was watching a long reel when midway through, my phone's screen turned off and I was too late to stop it...

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some reason my comment box has turned into a single line that goes on and on. It used to be a scrolling text box, which is obviously much easier to use when making longer comments. I have an android phone. Please fix this super annoying bug!!"

I can temporarily remove suggested junk from my feed, but even if I opt to not see it, it will manages to be there! No social media is worth anyone's time, this app has been less worthy of anytime since being bought by Facebook"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Actively watching insta videos does not count as activity and the handset screen times out, on activating the screen insta refreshes and you lose the video you were on and it refreshes the wall. Even if the timeout is a Android problem/setting, losing the video on reactivating the screen is an insta problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure why, but sometimes there's no volume when I watch reels, even when the volume is all the way up. I have to go out of the app, close it, then go back in. This usually happens when I watch a video on FB and it sends me to IG."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cannot access my recent photos in my gallery. Old photos and ones from whatsapp, for example, are there, but not new ones taken by the camera. Other the apps can access the photos so you would have thought Instagram which is based on SHARING PHOTOS would have that basic function sorted..... but clearly not."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried to make an account and was automatically banned before I finished setting it up. I mean before terms of service, before anything. Tried again with another email and got banned again. I've never been able to post or use it at all. Also, you need to share all of your contacts and phone number so they can spam your boss, coworkers, friends, etc."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Trying the app for the first time and it won't even let me make an account. It says I need a code that will be sent to my email which is fine... but then it never sends me the code and then it won't let me hit the resend code button and when I finally was able to it still wouldn't send a code. I was actually feeling good about finally trying to make an account with the app but now I don't even want to
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fairly good app with robust privacy settings. Stories seem to be the major focus, and the app notifies the poster when you view them, whether you react to the post or not. For a site focused on photography, why can't we post in landscape?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My reel is stuck in 'it will auto post when possible' from yesterday, I'm 100% sure I have a good internet connection, 'retry' option is not working too, please help get my reel atleast into draft so that I can post again or save it to my phone, I'm worried I might loose that reel, please see through this problemüòê, I'm regretting for using the app for a short video now, please do somethingüòî"

Also previously there was an option to turn off posts feeding into Facebook. I've cleared cache, and uninstalled and there is the same issue. Use to be straight forward before."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Something needs to be done about notifications you've set alerts for from pages you follow. I get a notification but as soon as I open the app to see one, the others disappear. It would make more sense for the alerts to show in the notifications in the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Instagram dark mode went from pitch black/ lights out to light navy blue. Its driving me crazy at nights and dark areas. What even is the use of such a useless feature which you cant even turn off and its happening on my main account, not on the other accounts. I'm willing to stop using Instagram solely due to this."

I found it totally distracted. Unhappy with instagram, it never takes your complaints, and there are so many people who are opening fake accounts of your instagram id, but instagram does not take any action. ü´§"

Please solve this problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is full of glitches. The feed doesn't refress most of the times. Once you pin a post there is no option to unpin. Messages in DMs get send twice. Random people whose profiles I have never even seen are present in my follow list. Please improve the application.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For no apparent reason this app eats up 8GB of storage on my phone every time I make a reel. I have to wipe the app storage and reset my app settings every time to make sure I don't run out of storage on my phone after making a few reels!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Beware security bug - app sharing videos in DMs without my consent - Meta won't help. For the last few months the app has randomly been sharing videos from my device to differ over recently spoken to in DMs. I've tried reporting them and nothing.
