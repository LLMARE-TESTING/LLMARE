"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app. A very good way to keep a Digital Album of the memories that you have created with your homies‚ù§. Just a small feedback. Instagram should allow to delete a particular slide(picture) from a post of 10 pictures. Because life is very unpredictable. Some event happens, after which, you don't want to keep the people in a particular photo on your profile, but you don't want to delete other pictures in the same post. Why deleting other memories only because of one bad memory?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is great, but not for business accounts. The problems I have are that I cannot schedule posts through my phone. I can only schedule posts through my tablet. Also, boosting barely works. I reach maybe two more people than usual when I boost when the promise is up to 100. The other problem is the algorithm. If you are an up-and-coming artist, it's extremely hard to gain traction and have it stick. Other than that, it's a good app if you're not using it as a business account."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unable to scroll through a story without it freezing solid. It randomly crashes at time where it's never been opened so how's it running in the background? The reels when clicking on one are extremely repetitive instead of loading new things. Fix your app. Now. Was flagged for unfollowing a bunch of people at one time (expected). 3 days later, I get told I apparently used something to get likes/follows and now I'm completely limited and can do nothing until 2024-04-08. FIX YOUR USELESS SYSTEM."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I guess the app updated at some point, because now I can no longer view any saved or like posts/reels that I've seen. Years of posts from friends and family or reels that I found to be enjoyable are just gone. No clear answer or solution to fix this issue. There used to be an option that said recent activity that showed these, but that option is gone."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1.When i tap on the reel/video, the video pauses/plays. If the audio of the reel is off, i tap on it to unmute but instead of unmuting it pauses the video. Now again if the reel is playing with full volume, but when i want to mute the audio i tap on it, instead of muting the reel pauses. New feature lets you pause/play by tapping, but how to mute/unmite the video? L 2. Your Meta AI gives absurd and bizzare information, its untrue , like rumours. üëΩ Tech people fix this"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Instagram and think it has some great qualities. However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would love it however, whenever I add a new photo to the previous images that I want to post, it bugs out and all my progress(including the previous photos) are lost. You can understand how infuriating this can be when I spent ages picking and editing each photo. Moreover, I'm unable to pause the reels, I can only do it by long holding the screen. Finally, when I'm posting with music, the song stutters or glitches. It becomes very annoying after a while and other people have the same issue"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Stories and highlights used to be working just fine. Now some of the stories won't show up in my archive. Sometimes, some of the stories I tried adding to my highlights won't show up either, even if I've tried multiple times. Updating doesn't work. I've had to reinstall repeatedly. This app is already good, but I hope this gets fixed as this is inconvenient. Edited to 2 stars. When I try to log into another account, app says it's non-existent when it isn't."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Making reels is so painful. The app crashes so many times and all the work gets lost. Sometimes I will spent 20-30 minutes creating a reel out of 10 or so videos which is perfectly timed to the music, and then the app will either crash and I have to start again. Or I will post it, and the music will be out of sync etc. It's incredibly frustrating, and I get it, it's just an app, but if you have like 2bn+ people using your app, it should be perfect."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is mostly fine. I can't believe that reels, which is basically rebranded Instagram TV or whatever it was called, is still so glitchy. I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck. Have to restart the app. The time slider doesn't work or disappears half the time. And every time I open a suggested reel, it tells me I can scroll to see more. Like as though I don't know that by now. Also, where is the opt back in to political suggested posts? Does it even exist? Or are you lying?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! ü§¶
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a great app. It is very user friendly and entertaining. But nowadays, I'm facing a lot of issues with the app. Whenever I reinstall the app, I am getting an outdated version of the app, and it's taking a lot of time to get updated. Even after getting the update, I am unable to use the layout option for stories. It keeps glitching. Really disappointed with the app lately. Requesting meta and Instagram to fix this bug ASAP."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pausing reels is inconsistent. One week I tap the screen and it pauses the next the same action mutes the video. Pausing should be intuitive. (especially if pausing is needed to prevent autoscrolling) There is no option to disable autoscrolling on reels as of right now. I don't want this feature. I don't like it. I want to stop it. It's not useful and it happens at the worst times.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like instagram, but this app has a lot of issues lately. Ever since updating the app a couple of weeks ago, I can no longer add my own posts to my story. The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3.5 stars. Purpose of the app is fun and easy to use but there is no consistency in the UI. I don't know why the developers keep changing it. Contacts changing back and forth between lists and bubbles, rearranging contacts, adding favourites that aren't at the top of your search, tap to pause, then tap to mute, then back to pause. Just stick with one UI please"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Instagram! It's my go-to platform for connecting with friends, staying updated on trends, and exploring new content. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, and the variety of features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV keeps things interesting. Plus, the algorithm seems to know exactly what I'm interested in, so my feed is always filled with relevant and engaging posts. Overall, Instagram gets a solid 5-star rating from me!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Painful to upload pictures. Sometimes when carefully selecting and editing your pictures for a post to the feed, the app just crashes and you're left empty handed. When using square frames, IG tends to screw this up and on one side of the picture, there is an ugly white bar. Sometimes on the story when you use a location, the font is below the icon which makes it look ugly. Sometimes when you post the story, the picture stays on the screen after so you have to reopen."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Am having an issue with your app. Whenever something is being uploaded on my story it takes forever as if that's not enough. Even when it's done loading I can't switch to my second account. And my second account is my business account it's very important to me. Then I can't even read messages in my DMs. I see them in the notifications and when I open the app to reply. They don't appear. It's almost impossible to get a song using your app. I have to get from other apps then post.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has become so poor I'm so close to leaving it completely. Tagging people resets the post. Adding photos to a draft resets the post. Selecting multiple photos for a post doesn't work half the time. Basic functions have become broken to the point that I don't have time to deal with the multiple attempts and this is coming from a full time creator. Going to just focus on my YouTube content now, I'll post here when I have time to waste and a high bandwidth for frustration."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This new update is not cool at all. When someone sends me a reel and I want to keep scrolling and see something new, it just keeps recycling the same reels in the chat. And you can refresh the reels because it keeps going up the list of reels already in the chat. Also, on android, when you would tap the screen, it would pause the video, amazing! That has been removed for some reason. Grrrr"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The android version has always been so buggy, and it only gets worse over time. Key aspects that should work do not and it makes it hard to be able to use the app at all. Photo cropping does not work and resets any edits you've made constantly. The pin to profile/unpin doesn't function properly. If you open a link in someone's bio in dark mode, it immediately bugs out the whole UI when you return from the link... the list goes on."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so glitchy when it comes to posting story or on feed. It use to work fine but for the past 3 months it's a hassle to post anything. I've officially stopped even trying to post stories or anything since the app crashes or the screen goes black everytime I try to post it. When I try to post 1+ pics, the layout can't be changed, I can't search for more filters. When I try to post on feed, the order and edit and filters don't work. Fix the issues. It's genuinely irritating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some bugs just piss me off...it's not that they don't get fixed after someday but in every update there's a new issue and hey for sure I love this app and never has a thought crossed my mind to deactivate my account...I have been using this platform ever since I got my first smartphone (6 years ago) and it has gone through its ups and downs. I am leaving a 4-star rating because after the lockdown started Instagram changed dramatically and is still making changes. Thanks, Instagram forever more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great when it works. I often have to wait a long time for updates to actually get to my phone. With having different accounts, the update will only be on one account and not the others. Sometimes when I redownload the app, the update is completely gone. I've had to move accounts consistently because the app would be on an older version ONLY for that account. It's frustrating. If I'm on the app too long it'll break and I'll need to reopen it. Other than that, it works as intended."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The feed is in no apparent order, which is annoying. Stories disappear after 24 hours, which is too short. Also, using your fingers to enlarge a picture for a story often makes the picture tilt to one side, making a mess. Accidentally touching the top of the screen causes the feed to scroll all the way to the top, which is STUPID. Why does a blank space act as a button? Also, the ""use the app"" button in Chrome opens the app to the feed instead of the user's profile."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is okay. At best. 1) Algorithms are trash. Starts on a random feed you likely haven't seen yet, just before refreshing itself to show you a whole new recycled feed. 2) Photo sharing consistently degrades quality. 3) Pausing videos is buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Goes hand in hand with: 4) The NEW problem of not being able to go forward or back on a video while it's playing. If this wasn't an accidental bug, you should probably reconsider. Please fix?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Starting a few versions back, I'm not able to reproduce reels sent by Whatsapp or any other app. When I click on the link, Instagram opens up in the reels but in black screen and video is never reproduced. Please note that I'm able to open the link to post, this issue only happens with reels. UPDATE: A few weeks back the issue was solved."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Engagement on Instagram has fallen so hard over the years. They want you to upload reels in order to be seen, but when you try to upload a reel it doesn't work, either it posts to drafts instead of public, or the text you placed dissapears, or the music you added goes to 100% volume despite turning it down. If you want us to use specific features on your app, maybe make them functional? Then there's the issue of thousands of spam/bot accounts that comment on all of the photos you post. Over it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been using instagram since last year and the features are just great i like the way that you can highlight your stories and etc. i also like the way that you can add music to your posts to add a little more detail . But the only problem is if you log in your account in multiple devices it gives you like an error that you can't log in in other more devices. But overall still my favorite social media app in communicating with friends and family.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads (I'm sure everyone agrees with this!), too much unwanted content and wildly inconsistent between accounts! Two separate personal accounts I can see (mine and someone else's), and the layout is different on each one! We need to be able to ONLY see the accounts we follow as a default, and when an ad is hidden, selecting not to see an ad from them again should work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of my stories in my archive aren't there anymore. They just disappeared. Some of the stories in my archives, I also put in my highlights. They're not in my highlights, either. I don't know what bug this is but random stories from both my archive and highlights have been disappearing randomly. Please fix this. Edit (Apr. 2, 2024): Same problem. My recent stories that happen to be my favorites are GONE! This is NOT okay!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is awful. As much as I am used to it and actually like it, its quality is horrendous. I have to fight body and soul everytime I change my goddamn password or delete an account. In addition to that, the last update is terribly bad. When I try to change a reel's timing, it bugs suddenly. Honestly, the overall assessement is truly dissapointing, I personally used to love this app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I consider this app to be something of a scam. The app automatically hides pages almost as soon as you've downloaded them, even though they're still in the app. There's almost 200MB of material in the cache, but you cannot retrieve it because all Instagram want you to do is waste data downloading over & over again. There's some interesting stuff on here, but really it's for those who just wanna look at photos, some of which are very obviously & dubiously manipulated."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most recent update is an absolute pain. Can give me the option to add music to one or multiple photos and stays like this for a couple of days when all of a sudden batches of posts with music have had the music removed. Reels and posting stories onto my profilehave also been a struggle to make on the app as it consistently crashes and I have to restart all over again or just make my own reels but on a different app in order to post anything to the platform. Really disappointed in the new update.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So today I get an error message when I try to do anything ""cannot refresh feed"". Message failed to send. Something has gone horribly wrong. I have full bars of service and zero problems with any other apps/ internet. Recent update wiped out my actual ""newsfeed"" No I don't want to only see 3 suggested reels of people who I don't know. What is this? Slowly getting rid of yet another of the few parts of Instagram I actually liked. This app used to be about sharing photos with friends."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reels are great. Checking out posts are great, but I've been having this same ongoing issue with being able to listen to voice messages sent to me. I've reported it and updated the app. Given all the possible permissions I can give, but it still doesn't work. And it's stupid."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This would have been a better app if all those glitches are cleared and made this app bug free. Some messages cannot be seen even after it is delivered and I couldn't zoom the profile picture. There are more and more bugs that I couldn't list all of it out. Some features are available for some users and not for others. Hope those bug would be cleared at the earliest.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The background music for my multiple photos in a post (not reel) are gone although you could still see the name of the song on top. Also, I dont understand why I can't magnify or enlarge the stories with my fingers for one of my accounts while it can be done with my other account. It's useful when I can't read the captions. Thirdly, what happened to 'series'? It was great to categorize photos."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Low support for android, especially high end phone like s24 ultra. Having a few issues, which i would like it improve on high priority, 1. Sequence option, slider is not snappy and responsive. Video doesnt respond well by using a slider. 2. Touch to pause on Reels is too slow on android, whereas, on iPhone, when you touch on reels. It pauses very quickly. 3. Bad camera quality and too noisy. Please fix those issues. I dont know why instagram dont fix it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1. Removing the ability to unread messages was dumb. 2. Pausing reels wasn't necessary. 3. Sometimes the explore page refreshes; not showing you content you've liked/saved and instead showing scenery, things that would show on a new account. There's also just a lot of unnecessary updates that make the app worse! Stop adding things that don't need to be added. Ex. Pausing reels/moving the mute button! Ex 2. The share to threads button replacing the share to story one. There's much more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"2 stars for creating flipside, absolute solution for introverts and those who appreciate structure and tidy publishing. 1* for last 10 years innovations, I like reels and music add-on. 1* for the liberty to choose our preferred ads, this is very crucial for peace of mind in scrolling. Minus 1* because I had glitch and lost all accounts I followed. Now revived but some of them hung in requesting mode. It was a limbo experience for almost a week. TYSM developers!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the new update I can't create reels or stories. It bugs 9 times out of 10. Been trying to identify how to reproduce the bugs 100% but I can't. It's a nightmare. Can't edit videos in reels, can't use templates, can't mix sounds... and reels have been pushed my instagram for the last 4 years. Insane. Stories bug if I try to out text in them when recording a clip from InstaStories. Considering uninstalling. Need a bugfix ASAP"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's starting to be less fun. I use the app mostly for family, friends, and looking at sports highlights, food, and comedy. The notification icon will say I have notifications, but then it's all ""suggested for you"" but most of the ""suggested"" are accounts where we dont have any friends in common. and mostly spam accounts. Also you can only pause notifications for 8 hours. After that there will be messages and what's in them going across the screen. Tried to turn it off or pause, but no."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the new update, if you have to add another photo after uploading the first photo in a story, when you go to 'stickers' and choose the 'gallery/photo option, you can't CHOOSE a particular photo from different folders !! A random folder opens and you get only LIMITED photo options to upload! Anybody else with the same problem? This is so annoying!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi, I'd like to appreciate the effort you have put in making such a nice app, meanwhile there is a bug that I want to report. I don't know if it only exists in the android version or not but when you close the application via the home or back buttons most of the times, last video that was being shown on the app keeps playing even though the app isn't running in the foreground anymore. Many of my friends have this problem too. I'd be glad if you can solve this issue in the future updates. Thanks."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So for the past two weeks Instagram has been crashing on me and giving me an error every single time I try to open it. I've uninstalled and redownloaded several times, rebooted my phone several times, with the app either uninstalled or not installed to reinstall again, and it just doesn't work. It's not a problem with my phone. Instagram Lite is useless because it freezes and stops responding all the time. I used to like this app a lot but I'm sick and tired of this."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. I can't find All my saved folders (just the first 4). How do I find the rest of my saved items??? 2. I can no longer see the total number of saved items like before. I need this feature back as it helps me keep count of the number of saved or removed items in my folders. 3. I also need the suggestions feature removed from my DM area, as it creates A CLUSTER. It is also, an unnecessary update feature (since we can always search a name & send a direct message) I don't see why it's needed!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. Absolute waste of time. I run my photography business account through Instagram and I've just upgraded phones. The app on my old phone was bad, but not now I've updated, I can't even log into my main account. I have 3 different accounts for different subjects (nature/wildlife, weddings/portraits and automotive). I try to log into my main one, it just logs me into another one... so now I can't use it. The algorithm was bad enough, but doesn't matter now anyway"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use this app primarily to post content for my clients but I have grown to love to create content. Cool video, cute meter's , reels and stickers on the stories. But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying. Do better."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally reported in 8/2023. STILL HAPPENING. I must delete then reinstall the app multiple times a day. The app continues to revert back to the old version and glitch out. Stories are affected, missing filters and features like my avatar. My chat themes are a mess.. From randomly not showing at all to missing graphics, there's several issues. After having and using the app for several years, why suddenly are there issues that aren't getting fixed??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram isn't what it used to be anymore. I've been using this app for years and years back it worked perfectly fine. There never were issues but since updates kept coming and certain things changed, there's constantly issues (that are rather annoying) popping up. Such as the inbox not working properly. Having to refresh in-app for messages to appear. Not being able to post or change pfp without the app closing itself, stories acting up weird, etc. kinda dissapointing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi there, please improve your saved post section. It's difficult to track saved posts not in collections & frustrating to find quickly. As Instagram is used for inspiration and ideas, we saved a lot of posts over time. And often struggled to find saved posts that aren't in any collection. Adding ""without collection"" feature would save time and frustration, making the app experience smoother. Many users would love and appreciate improvements at here. Please consider. Thank you."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is nonfunctional. I can't select anything without getting a notification that two of my actions have been deleted as spam but when I click to see them, it says all of my content is fine and I have access to all features. If I exit out of this notification, the app becomes a blank white rectangle. If I restart the app, I'm immediately sent to the notification again. This happens across devices. The app simply does not work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How can such a popular, widely used app still have such an awful mechanism for pausing or fast forwarding in a video? Oh, good, the reel restarted AGAIN. If only I could skip the part I already watched! Nope. Beyond being a waste of time in-general and showing you content you don't care about, even when you find something you DO want to see, this app's functionality is awful and seemingly intentionally wastes even more of your time. Trash"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst notification settings I've ever seen. I just want to turn off reel notifications. Is that really such a hard feature to implement? It's turned into junky adware. It's also somewhat clunky with how posts update. You'll open the app, see a post you want to read, and immediately, it disappears through the auto refresh (which you can't disable!). I wish there was an alternative. If you haven't created an account yet, don't bother. Meta has absolutely ruined this app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive been dealing with this specific issue for the past few weeks and it's bothering me a lot. My phone is a Samsung s23 FE, I don't know if that's the problem or not but I can't upload pitch black photos. The reason I want to upload them is for aesthetics but I can't. And, in one specific account, when I enable dark mode, it gives me more Navy blue ish background. I also can't hear my voice notes nor others voice notes when I'm on the phone. These issues are really irritating me."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It looks as if their are several bugs to fix or off and on problems with my Instagram, but, they do eventually fix it. Update: have had my site for almost a year. Now all of a sudden, I can't use my schedule function. I also just found out that I can't post to my storyline. I try and report the problem but I'm not sure if anyone works on it or even reads the emails. The platform is great when it all runs smooth, I have had anything but."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the latest update, reels cannot be fast forward nor can you rewind without it freezing or stopping or just fully restarting the video, sometimes even refreshing the entire thing so your reel is gone! The worst feature in my opinion is that it tries to skip to the next reel, *WHILE* you are WATCHING the one you're on! Sometimes I enjoy repeating the video or I'm busy looking at the comments. It is so incredibly frustrating and upsetting. I hate the new update."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"instagram updates seems to be getting worst. i can ºt seem to use the layout feature, whenever i tried to use it, it turned black and it takes eternity to load. the same goes to the music feature, it seems like i can choose what song i want to put on my story but the moment i posted the story, the song wouldn ºt load and yes, it takes eternity. by eternity i meant ETERNITY. not even a millisecond of the song will start when my internet actually works perfectly fine. please fix this."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: videos won't post now?! scheduled post?Gone! So many updates, and yet this app just gets worse and worse! Trying to save drafts is impossible! It NEVER saves. Makes you start all over again. It's honestly very discouraging. Posting a quick video shouldn't be so difficult. Instagram needs an entire new development team. You guys are continuously dropping the ball. A lot of people use this app and you guys got egotistical and thought it was perfect....it's very, very far from that."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't imagine how such famous and popular app can have such really easy to find bugs. And for me as for an user they are not really easy to fix within ""user workarounds"". But these issues relate to different base parts of functionality that should work ideally by default. Even features like: followers sorting,photo editing,posting,stories,search - don't work correctly at all. I don't even tell about how Instagram spoils the photo quality however this app is about photos. It's a shame"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been trying to scroll through my followed accounts to find a particular one and every few seconds it automatically scrolls back to the top. It's unusable. Not to mention if you leave the app for even a second it refreshes the feed and you lose whatever you were looking at. I know it's on purpose so you get distracted and spend more time on the app but I can't even use it for what I want anymore.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"To be fair, these are relatable for this stage of the app. I still don't have Notes on my main profile, but do on others and tried everything, it needs fixing. Besides that, please put the pop-up comments back to the end of the video, they are distracting at the beginning and not that useful like this. These experimental updates and feature tweaks are annoying and degrade the user experience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be a fantastic app if the bugs were fixed. Everytime I attempt to log in to an account and error message pops up. I've tried resetting my passwords, opening my accounts from the website, and trying to log in through email links but nothing has been working. The lack in quality when posting an image is also very irritating. This app would definitely bring more people in if the ones behind it fixed the issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so frustrated with this app that I don't even know where to start. What's the point of having an option to crop a thumbnail for a reel for it to appear differently on the profile grid? In reels I work meticulously for them to look exactly how I want them to look, but when I post them, they are cropped differently. Jesus Christ. I like Instagram in general, but bugs like that are terribly demotivating. Please, fix this!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the update I am not able to navigate the timestamp bar at the bottom of reels. It's very irritating because often time I'd want to may be share a video and show a specific information in that video and that feature helped me to watch the video from between or from any timestamp I want. Now just vanishes as soon as I click on that thin bar. Please fix this, what's the point of having it if I cannot move forward/backward in a video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is just falling apart. Over emphasis on stories, random updates that change the layout/interface with no explanation on the changes, every version of the app appears to be different, video quality seems to have dropped since the recent update, the algorithm is awful and assumed that because you see something once that's all you want to see. Instagram, stop with the updates and just make this a simple app again"

Bug report fails to send. Tried updating. Nope. Tried clearing cache. Nope. Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling. Guess what, now I can't log back in. I enter my email and password, but none of the 2FA methods are working. Won't send notifications. Won't send confirmation code text messages. Locked out and unusable."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It seems there's a glitch where the bar at the bottom where I used to be able to fast forward to go to a specific spot in the reel isn't allowing me to do this anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch or if that feature was removed. But it is impacting my experience with Instagram pretty negatively because I don't want to have to watch the whole reel from the beginning if I want to see a specific part of the video.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still... to make it even worst, it's my business page that is being affected. I don't understand what is going on or why. I have a Samsung phone, not working, I have an iPad, and no problems from to post from my iPad."

Added 2 stars Difficult to post (bc editing will make pics have weird framing, so can only post never edit in app) Ever since I updated this year it's impossible for me to FIND my recently taken photos (I've searched in every album listed in IG). Not only that but it's like it randomly chooses what photos (including downloads) will even show up for me to post. It's infuriating and very frustrating. I wish I'd never updated"

Bugs when I make reels to the point where it will delete all my progress and I have to start again, won't mute sound on reels when slowing speed down, says error when I try to upload any story with a sticker or just decides to upload it without the sticker, constantly says can't refresh feed even when internet is fully functioning, if I crop a photo in a set, said photo goes wacky. For such a high-profile app I am shocked at how awful the programming is."

I love the everyday opportunities the app gives me, like seeing a fatal car accident the moment i click on reels, but also getting a content warning about a video of a plastic table getting pushed away by the wind. This feature singlehandedly cured my need to scroll through reels endlessly. Thank you."

Suppose someone send me a message at any particular time but I got the notification quite late, like 5 or 6 hours later and sometimes I don't get the notification at all. And yes, I have checked the notification settings of the app and of my phone, it's all good there and there's no network issue also. So don't say that there must be internet connection problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Two things make me sad and frustrated about Instagram on my phone, both related to the feed refreshing automatically. I open the app, glimpse a post I am interested in at the top of the feed, and a second later...it's gone. Thanks automatic refresher (that's sarcasm). I'm watching a reel in the feed, my screen turns off, I turn it on again, and WHOOSH there goes the reel I was watching. Thanks, automatic refresher (that's sarcasm again). Please, make the madness stop."

Another bug is not being able to load certain peoples voice notes. If it wasnt for my business I would never use Instagram."

First off, I get really annoyed at the fact that I can't get notifications sometimes. Idk if it's just my phone or if it's the app itself but it's annoying. Another, I hate that all videos (unless as a slide thing) are reels. I just want to unmute the video but it takes me to reels. It is just aggravating. Other then that I don't have any more problems with this. I just wish these would be fixed at some point."

I can see them just fine in my photos app, so I know they're there, but on Insta they're either greyed out & can't be clicked on, or despite scrolling down it will start to repeat the same few images. It happens everywhere, dms, posting, story. Super annoying glitch! Oh yeah, this has been going on for a while now."

The original audio was removed from my reel & apparently I get just ONE chance to replace it. I said ok, I'll replace the audio with another one. So imagine this: I choose another audio, this one apparently original by insta standards & it doesn't work. Now, insta says I should delete my reel & upload it again. Look, it's not about the stupid likes, I'm not a damn celebrity, but I don't have some of the photos on the reel. FIX IT!"

I want to see what my friends are up to, not pictures of cats from accounts I don't know and nothing else. When I X a suggested post and open the content settings, it says suggested posts have been snoozed every time. This is clearly not true, given that I got to that settings page from dismissing a suggested post. Nothing but a headache"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Updates are to make things better or to make it worse? Can't slide the video section in reels which was possible before the update. If you want to just rewatch the section of a reel you have to watch it again from the beginning. It's 2024 and Instagram still doesn't have edit option for your comments. How innovative is that. Need close friend option for post as well like the one in story.

At the moment it's making that big section of the app almost entirely unusable. And worst of all, it's impossible to contact any support about this"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is an unfathomable mess. It is flooded by scam bots that Instagram seemingly can't get a handle on, but constantly deleting regular comments as spam is totally possible. UI elements are constantly moved around, your most messaged contacts suddenly appear at the bottom of the suggestions, sharing something to your story moves around in the list for share actions, the whole structure of the app gets redone every time there is a new feature they want to highlight, it is beyond annoying."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IG has possibly the worst interface I've ever experienced. There is a progress meter at the bottom, but if you try to use it, the video pauses permanentlt. Mute? Permanent pause. Any kind of interaction but scroll up or down? (Which restarts the video) Start from zero. I give up. Jesus people, test the garbage you write before using it to sell my data."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really like the feature that when I press the volume down to be sure my volume is off before something in my feed makes a loud noise, ie in a Dr. Office. It just activates all the sounds. So innovative! So exciting. /s I hate it. Nearly rage uninstalled. The whole committee that approved that feature should be sacked, as well as whoever appointed them."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The autoscroll on reels is incredibly aggravating, there's a lot of times when I'm trying to read something in a reel and it just skips to the next one, and there's no way to turn this off it seems. Kinda makes me want to stop using Instagram all together. Update: since uploading this new review the app has randomly logged me out a couple times on my phone and is now saying this phone is a new device and I don't have access to some security settings for a bit because I logged into a ""new device"""
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Reel editor freezes every time I want to edit a video. When I finally got through it, the video wouldn't post (may have been my wifi so ok on that one). I deleted the app to see if the bugs were just from a previous version of the app. When I reinstalled it I couldn't get into my account without 2 factor auth, and the support page was buggy and wouldn't let me submit a support ticket. So frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for years and just starting to really dislike it more and more with every update. I primarily use IG for my stories because the capabilities are better and I can share it to FB with one setting. Convenient, I know.... Until ut stops working the way it's supposed to. I can't even record in my story anymore. Every time I try it deletes the whole thing and says the file type is unsupported. I've actually had to start recording stories on TikTok and just share them to IG, and to FB"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I signed up for an instagram account. I added maybe 10 friends, changed it to a private account, and added a profile picture. then you brats suspended my account. no idea why. I DIDN'T EVEN POST ANYTHING!!!!! it said I went against community guidelines, but there wasn't any content in the account to go against it. I have been searching and searching and can't find a way to contact any kind of customer support. The recovery stuff says I need a code from my phone, but won't send it to my number."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a good app until the recent updates. Reels are borderline unwatchable as none of the functions for them work. You can't scroll up or down without being sent to the main user's page, you can't click on the like button or see the comments without having to tap on them multiple times, and before, the rewind and scroller was broken too. Please fix these issues soon."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,P*rn ads starting to pop up in my feed. What the hell is going on Instagram? Changes to sending material to friends with the circular images isnt as good as the previous scroll down option... so I spend too long searching for friends profiles when it used to be easier. Last years changes to the insta feed s*ck. So I have to now sift through stuff I dont want to follow on the standard friends feed. Its hard enough to see my mates feeds as it is without this idiotic (and money minded ) change.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I noticed some of my stories are missing from my archives, especially 3 out of 4 from 4/13. After updating and logging out of, and then, back into the app, the 3 appeared the archives. But the 1 that was previously showing is no longer there. I'm tired of having stories missing from the archives!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just started using insta and went through all my pics so I knew what I wanted to post. Whether story or feed seems like the limit of 10 photos or videos is pretty limited. Out of any vacation I have never just taken 10 photos. Trying to pick out of an amazing trip or adventure is impossible. Breaking up feeds or stories is nonsense. Would just stick to snap for stories going away. Gave into limit and picked 10. Hit share to insta and only stories/reel showed up. Select 1 and got feed, fix bug."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The reels section does not have the ""sound off"" option anymore. When I tap on the video it just pauses it and I genuinely hate this. That's the only reason why I use Instagram instead of TikTok because I love listening to music while watching reels, and now I cannot do it. Don't try to be ""innovative"" anymore. Just leave it be."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is frustrating! The bar for the videos no longer works. It makes the video freeze. You can't zoom in anymore without it freezing. There's so many ads also. Almost every other video is an ad. I keep seeing ads for a mr. breast game that is not owned by him like it says. How is this legal? Their using his name because they know how popular he is! Y'all finally fixed it to see the comments on a reel while in Facebook. But at the same time, it's still messed up. 500 characters is not enough"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The home feed autorefresh is out of control. If I set my phone down and the screen turns off or I look at any other app, it refreshed. Sometimes it refreshes my feed because I look at comments for more than a minute. It's an absolutely terrible user experience that you can't turn off the excessive automatic refreshing. Ypu can't even see the posts from people you follow because it's nonstop refreshing the feed. It's been an issue for some time and Meta just doesn't care to LET US TURN IT OFF."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It won't let me into my other account since I changed my phone number. It keeps saying that it's going to send a verification code to my new number and nothing happens. I almost got scammed trying to contact someone about it! Be more accessible when people have issues with the app!!! UPDATE: It still won't let me in. Offers to take a selfie video, great, and then asks for a password. Guess what? Doesn't accept any passwords. No one has gotten back to me to help."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had so many issues with this app over the years, but most get worked out fairly quickly. This must recent one is horrible though. I cannot even open the app. Every time I try, my screen just goes blank. Nothing comes up at all. I can't log in on any of my accounts like this. I can't check messages. I can't see any data, post anything, just nothing at all. I cannot find any way to take off the latest update so I can at least get some functionality back... just everything is blank."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I came back after being disgusted with Tik Tok and YouTube shorts. It is still dismal. They constantly try to get you to watch reels, which is super annoying. I also posted something, and it was immediately buried. Imagine trying to show your friend a picture on your phone, but somebody grabs your phone from your hand and puts one hundred photos on your phone that your friend has to scroll through to see your photo."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is Instagram having such a hard time loading on my phone? I even bought a new phone to solve the problem & it still takes 5-8 minutes to load my feed. Also, posts on the feed should have the option to be shown chronologically (newest post first). I would also love a way to re-set the search page that has recommendations of posts we might like. I'm not the same person that I was three years ago & I'm still getting outdated suggestions. Your app needs work."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Randomly stops sending of messages, randomly stopped me from getting into my instagram account for a few weeks without any warning or email or anything, the dark mode switching to light mode breaks all the time, and messages in dms just randomly dissapear. Quality lowers even when changing the setting to only high quality when sending photos from camera roll. Calls don't connect to my headphones even though it says connected audio and calls. Very buggy and terrible app overall."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't even log in properly. I've tried everything to log in to my old accounts. But there seems to be an error everytime and saying ""couldn't refresh feed"". This has happened TWICE with some of my old accounts too, I had to create new ones and now there's a trouble logging in in my new ones too. Too many bots and definitely not a safe place for kids. Really poor service even after I tried everything including, fixing my wifi, clearing the app cache, even restarting my device."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of my go-to doom scrolling apps, it has been completely ruined by recent updates. From automatically scrolling to the next reel while I'm reading comments, to vibrating each time I like a comment, to ""sponsored reels"", etc. With no settings to turn off any of these features, I can't stand using this app anymore. Don't even bother with this app, just download tiktok instead."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is such garbage. Doesn't keep your edits making a post and loses all information on config changes. Every heard of saved instance state? Multi billion dollar company and can't implement the most basic Android functionality. Plus stories fail to upload for no reason, stuck in endless ""try again"" loop. Update: now crashes when trying to add a video to a post. How is this worse a year later?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Videos always freeze and glitch, which results in me closing the app and losing the reel I was previously looking at. I hate that posts on the explore page automatically scroll up. Now I can barely click comments, and I don't like that it pops up ""report spam, post on story etc etc,"" when you barely touch a comment. The algorithm is also horrible! I am tired of seeing the same posts that I saw days ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Stop moving the Link Copy option every other day!!! HATE where you buried the option to copy a link or share. So annoying! I have friends that stay on the app throughout the day because we constantly share links. We could do it quickly with the old format. Too many steps now mean we will spend less time on the app! We have tried it today. Massive FAIL! So unbelievably annoying and time consuming. I use the app less and so do friends when we can't find the copy link option to forward something.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever new update they rolled out is awful. Specifically on reels. The buttons don't work anymore, you'll press share and it'll bring you to the creator's profile, comments and it'll pause and become non-responsive to touch. The UI is horrible for such a common app. Did you hire children to complete the coding? There's a new auto-scroll feature that I blame for it - and who needs it? I can scroll on my own, I don't need the phone to dictate when I'm done on a certain video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Few suggestions for functionality that could improve the app. Introduce the concept of close friends for each post (or each posted pic among a series). So that people who want to post pictures for a limited audience within their account might be able to do so. When people accept the friend request, they should be able to control if the user can be added to close friends list or not. Suggestions for hashtags to be used would be a plus (usage of generative ai). Square frame editor"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Someone hacked my account. This person activated my account which was deactivated for over a year and posted scammer stories and my mutual friends got confused. One person actually believed and tried to invest in. This person also changed my email address so I cannot access to changing password. As well as I tried with phone number option, but the second authenticator made me unable to change password, which I don't have. This is so frustrating. And there's no one that's trying to help me from."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One decent update that Instagram got was the feature that enabled us to scroll through the reels in a chat. I had been wishing for this feature for longer than I can remember. Closing a reel and reacting and then opening another reel is fine when you have normal friends. My friends send 300,000 reels at once (exaggerated but you understand). I praised Instagram for that to everybody around me. Now you've gone and undone that update. Please give it back. üôèüèª"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's so great you can (theoretically) upload more than 10 images per post now. But this is useless when the app keeps crashing when you try to post. Once it finally worked it only posted 6 of my pictures and the rest is just white. Please don't take months to fix this like you did when adding music was bugged...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is the best social media platform that provides more entertainment all over the world. Supporting and helping people like creators and bloggers. However, please add the pause option in Reels. When we are reading comments, the reel plays automatically many times.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Explore page changed overnight with no influence of my own, the ""Not Interested"" choice on posts does absolutely nothing, and I'm now being recommended racist and completely irrelevant content. I want what I'm actually interested in back, and I've submitted four support requests in two weeks, all of which have vanished and I haven't got a single response. This app is going downhill fast, and I've already cleared my storage cache, uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and more."

I uninstalled it and Reinstalled it because it had a bug that won't refresh the page even that I restarted my phone and didn't work after a few days I came back to see that the page that couldn't refresh but their were no videos/posts that was before and it couldn't load at all ik this might not help to uninstall an reinstall but I had to do it I got scared I hope that the bug thing could get fixed!!(I will change my review to 5 if you fixed it) please I need this app!

Was on a pixel 7 Pro, reinstalled and still persisted. Now I'm on galaxy s24 and it's still doing it. Worth. Voting I think it glitches if you tap and pull to fast forward and then leave the video and go back to it and the sliders gone. Probably designed to force you back into the infinit scroll. Go fys"

It did upload 2 and then it just won't upload. Tried over days, re-downloaded the app etc... I wish it automatically saved to drafts when this happened so you weren't re-typing when it fails. As usual tonnes of ads, so I don't use it to look at anymore, why would you choose to watch so many ads?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"**Update** Insta has been an absolute headache recently. Since the last update the audio cuts out 1/4 - 1/2 way through videos I'm creating. I create the whole video, get the title ready, hashtags, etc only to find out the audio has cut out 1/3 of the way through the video. This is getting beyond frustrating.

Not only do I always have issues sending messages to people (stuck on ""sending"", I have to reinstall the app to fix) but now I can't even forward reels without it freezing and glitching.

Plus, you can discover new accounts and explore different interests through the Explore page. Overall, Instagram is a fantastic app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE INSTAGRAM. BUT Please stop overcomplicating apps that work perfectly fine. Updates should fix bugs and add value to the user, like being user friendly, fast and efficient. Anything else is unnecessary. Also, Please don't turn Instagram into Facebook. Facebook is literally just a advertising page now. And it's really not enjoyable, as a user nor as someone that does social media marketing. Just get back to your roots - and simplify things again."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Where to start? This app has never ""fit to frame"" anything... ever. I thought with the FB merge, this would be a priority, but no. (And we are talking about a photo and video app that sucks at both.) The latest is that videos on Stories start to play and freeze. It's ridiculous."

I can't send animated messages also I made a new second Id on my Instagram a while ago but they only give the reels option on my first one , I can't add Stories longer than 14 seconds even after the new update and many more problems. Seriously, These problems should be fixed! I uploaded this review 4 months ago, still no action taken!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is a really bad glitch, basically what happened was they removed one of my comments and there was a pop-up letting me know that they did that and why, but whenever I try to exit out of the pop up the screen goes black and doesn't let me do anything or press anything and soft locks the app, this pop up shows up every time I open the app, I tried updating it and that didn't do anything. Please help. Edit: I fixed it by uninstalling the app and downloading it again"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix your app ! I don't understand how after all these years, even with a flagship smartphone I'm getting poor performances from instagram. The camera is laggy and so are reels. The crop and the compression of posts makes it super hard for photographers to post the actual composition they were looking for. Probably the app with the worst algorithm as I'm getting targeted by the same 3 subjects all the time. Update: it got even worse With flipside it's almost impossible to add people as it loads"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The recomendations Instagram gives me based off of my personal intrests are great. The texting feature on the app is also really great, its easy and conveinient and even allows you to share content that you enjoy with content that others may enjoy. Moving on to the reels, the reels are great I like how you can give credit to people and or artists for sounds/songs. I also enjoy the comment section so that you can see what other people thought of the video and say what you though about It. *10/10*"

Annoyingly, it also crashes when you try to add a new photo to a selection of edited ones for a post!

Every new update to this app makes it more of a hellscape, it's the dumbest social media app that's out right now. I only use it for art and the algorithm is a nightmare. Just don't waste your time, even tiktok is better than this right now. It's too in your face, it hates the people that actually give them feedback, and it isn't worth fighting for yourself if they wrong u."

Never even shows me the people I follow on my own feed. It just constantly pushes suggested content.

However, my business page does not have all the music I want, even if I search it only has these unknown songs that don't give that kick to the work content I'd have created with the aim to go with the trends.

Reported multiple times and it hasn't been taken down. The log in details were all changed before being able to confirm in an email that it wasn't the person's account. 7 days later, the account is still up and is clearly a scam account now. Also, having top comments pop up on instagram reels is really annoying."

It either erases everything (no matter at what step I can be) and makes me lose all the progress or it posts pics completely altered that they do not look like what it is posted. Some of them have posted even in just black. Similar things happen when posting reels, where it repeats the pics or videos and it does not warn you. If it weren't for the stories and friends, I would have deleted the account."

Instagram keeps being the worst app made for Android I ever used!"

Nothing shows up in chronological order, and if you accidentally go to another page when you come back, all the posts will be different. It's awful. Most importantly, Meta is now limiting political content. During an election year during multiple genocides. This is truly foul. The only reason I go on here is for on the ground news of what's happening. Can't wait for liberation so I can delete this app."

It's gotten more confusing now but my only main problem is not being able to skip and fast forward parts on other people's reels.

I follow people i know so i can see their posts but now im not even seeing that. My home page should not turn into the reels page after ive seen all the most recent posts. This app was pretty decent but now its so ridden with adds and garbage reels that its almost unusable. Then they use this app to try and shove threads down your throat.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There's a feature in the account center that's broken. It's the sharing of new created accounts feature. I can't create a new account to share with my main account. It's just saying that it's registering but nothing happens. The new account was not being made. Another one that I'm adding today is the sudden log out of my account even If I already saved it. I tried to log in but it's looking for a password but the problem is I didn't sign up with passwords. Instead I signed via my FB account.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has gone from my favorite social media to I don't even want to open it anymore. To force an auto play to the reels without giving us an option to turn it off is ridiculous. Also, being automatically logged out without you doing anything to do so is dumb. IG is slowly dying, and these past updates have given it a violent shove into its grave."

I always get updates only on my 2nd profile and not the principal one. Creating or editing reels directly on the app is almost impossible.. everything glitches and loads for ages, including dms.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a great social media platform, getting better with each update. I mostly like the new download option,that has made a lot of things easy. But one thing I think they should add is a way to be able to restrict certain followers from viewing your post -and not just your story- without having to block them. Also there should be a way to delete certain messages without having to delete the whole conversation or unsend it. This would be a great add on. Thank you. Keep up the good work."

If that doesn't get fixed im closing my 12 year account because I'm so sick of a massive and rich company unable to do the slightest of tasks.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You won't stop asking for a review. So fine. Posts glitch. Reels are broken for my viewers and break less than 20 seconds in. Constantly clips and crops my images so I have to sacrifice size and quality to make anything fit within your stupid grids. Not only that but you have LEGITIMATELY no way of contacting customer support about actual issues; I've reported a scam product for more than 6 months and no one can find anything wrong with a product that's actively causing health concerns. Ok.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is constantly glitching and I can't use my side buttons on my phone to take selfies, which means a selfie stick is pointless. I know iPhone users were having this issue first. I'm on a Samsung. Can't edit videos. If try to upload a video I took with my own camera phone, it won't allow it. You can't send voice messages that are longer than a minute, which is weird because Insta is supposed to be part of Meta and I can leave 10 minute voice messages on FB chat but not insta chat."

Colours that overlap background colours, reels section not loading even when you have a stable connection, unreasonable amount of ads and boosted content plus frequent app crashes. Updating app with the hopes of getting bug fixed is a big deal to ask for apparently now. Instead of launching games through emojis, try fixing your app first."

It's my humble request to Instagram team to fix it
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram is becoming unsafe for most of it's users. It gets compromised so easily. For hackers it is so easy to hack whereas for users it appears as if it is highly secured. After account getting hacked there is hardly any support from Instagram. Soon it will be the next orkut.

It's not the android phone it's self because the quality is great with Samsung and Google phones just to name a few phones with great cameras but it's the app that's not optimize for those phones.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,One thing that disappointed me is that it doesn't have any options like 'select multiple followers' to 'remove' them. It becomes very difficult to remove those unwanted followers one by one. So Instagram should look into this matter and try to introduce this type feature where one would be able to select and remove multiple unwanted people from the followers list. I'm facing a lot of problem due to this. Please solve it. Thank you.

I can hear the sounds or music on all public posts, reels and stories but not on private accounts. I've cleared all cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still this glitch is there. Kindly help."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is indeed an good app but from last few days its showing errors in uploading reels. Couldn't upload any reel because of that annoying green glitch in my reels. And it would be really helpful if you take action and fix that problem. Thank you.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The amount of irrelevant repetitive ads is killing me. Can the algorithms please forget I exist for a few days? On a serious note, why can't we opt out of seeing certain types of ads? I am being targeted with exercise-app ads, weight loss ads, lose-weight-while-you-sleep ads... it's becoming ridiculous, and frankly quite toxic!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love instagram but now it is all reels Instagram used to be about photos, I wish there was a filter function. Why have a all reels tab but not a only photos tab??? What's the use? Also, now the saved posts categories only shows the 5 most used catagories. If you want to go into a folder you have to save a photo into the category to make it most used, then you can access the category."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been randomly logged out if my account since yesterday and have no way of getting back in. The SMS code never comes through and no option to receive it via email or anything else. I want my account back. It's not been removed or disabled so why can't I log back in. It's ridiculous. I've had this account for years now and I've never had so many problems as I have this year. No way of contacting anyone for support or help with retrieving my account. Absolutely ridiculous. Sort it out.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to use Instagram a lot but for some reason I notice missing features every time I get in, I thought it was a bug when I couldn't chose the time on reels like I used to, the bar disappears when I click once!

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What is with the bugs and glitches in the INSTAGRAM these days? End to end encrypted chats are so worst. I can't see them in my chats or in senders list. I can't change the profile picture of group. Even the reels are coming in the form links and I can't preview them like normal personal chats. And if this all was not enough then when i am trying to react with emojis to those link form reels my chats are crashing and directing me to home page. There's more...i can't make group w/o encryption.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Automatic refresh is very annoying. If you put your phone down for a moment and want to come back to a story or a video you can't because of refreshes and then it's lost in Neverland. We're competent enough to refresh our own apps.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Backwards thinking Instagram. Again the ability to forward through reels has disappeared. I want that flexibility to forward through reels as an option. Otherwise I won't be watching any insta videos, therefore spending less time on your app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm using it from a long time but from the last days of February I'm facing texting problems. When i see a text, sometime later it becomes unseen again and continues for days like this. And the second thing I'm facing is sending a text message, whenever I text or voice message someone it takes 15-20 mins in sending while the pictures and videos takes normal time. I reported this bug 3 times on Instagram app but I got no response from the Instagram team and the problem isn't solved yet."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram's Declining Quality: A Decade of Disappointment After 10 years of loyal use, Instagram's instability is frustrating. Low-quality posts, buggy editing tools, and poor resolution on videos with Instagram fonts tarnish the experience. For a major social media company, this level of quality is unacceptable. Instagram needs to prioritize stability and quality control to meet user expectations."

Nothing is popping up at all. And I have had a few friends complain to me about instagram as well. I don't know if there was an update or something but with Android it's not working as great. I'm really thinking about switching back to iPhone."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a pretty nice app to interact with ur friends and to know about their life in general. Imho a nice way to improve instagram as a whole is if there's an added function to pick what should be recommended in my home page based on what i like! :) Honestly, if it is possible, i hope i would hv the option to choose not to receive content based on following's likes unless i allowed so, and it would be better if i could select whose liked post could come up my recs."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: Now I can't see videos at all. It says couldn't refresh feed. Every other app on my phone works, but this one. Last update causes the video to freeze when I try to rewind or go forward. That was such a useful feature. Hopefully it gets fixed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE app. It keeps sayingg ""couldn't refresh feed"". It doesn't matter if I'm on data or WIFI, my connection is fine, I've tried clearing my cache and updating the app. This app is horrible I can't even view people's pages anymore or even look at the comments section. Its not my phone, its the app. FIX IT."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Using the app you think that they are trying to make it the worst possible version of itself , the reels are wierd , often when you refresh the feed the audio of the previous reel is still playing . The messages tab often glitches and doesnt show people. And now the app itself doesnt even open ."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fast Forward Slider is not working. Whenever I try to forward or take the reel backwards using the slider, the video stucks and gets hang. I have tried everything, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, logging out and relogging. Clearing cookies and caches, etc. But none of it has worked."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After installing new update now I am not able to seek the video and if I tried to seek then video stops playing and freeze and the second thing if someone reply on my comment and if I navigate through the notification then the status bar becomes black and it looks very bad, and there are tons of issues in this app which is impossible to list here, please fix the issues."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is a bug that's been going around for some time where your keyboard block your ability to see what your are typing, and literally nothing had been done about. This is a very well known issue. The ""Solution"" is to use a floating keyboard. But of I wanted to do that, I would already be doing it now wouldn't I. Update: I'm starting to think this is on purpose against me specifically, because I created another account on the same phone, and it worked just fine. Coincidence I think not."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, but it no longer works for me when using wifi. Posts and stories will not load at all unless you're using data (and running up your phone bill). The problem persists even with the most recent update. I've tried every troubleshooting fix I can find, and reported it multiple times, with no change. Maybe it's time to switch to a different platform, since this one seems to be dead."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Completely can't do anything. Feed won't refresh, can't see any new posts, stories, notifications, anything! This update is awful and a friend suddenly can't use her's. Where's the fix!!!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the second time I've had to uninstall the app because it won't allow me to post. I run a business, and if you know anything about IG... when you uninstall the app, all reels drafts are deleted. I put a lot of time into my work, and this is the SECOND TIME yall made me lose HOURS of work. Don't recommend IG for business!!!!!!!!!! Tiktok is better."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay. However, refusing to copy other platforms can make it better. Equally, an ever-changing algorithm, constant glitches, and a lack of originality make this platform extremely difficult to enjoy and grow. Even worse, at the time of this review, everything is Reels, Reels, Reels. This excludes individuals wanting to share images, etc. Long story short, it sucks. üò∂"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I get a notification it just jumps to the first page. Even when I'm watching a video or look at pictures, it just jumps to the Homepage. It really bothers me. And I always have to change my password because it says ""looks like you shared your password"". But I forgot my old one so when I click on ""forgot password?"" It jumps right back to the first message and doesn't let me change my password so now I again can't use my account. This happens so damn often."

Insta customer support team no help. This problem literally started because of the app randomly crashing. Comments can't even be reported? What is your platform doing??
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst experience, I don't know what you keep doing, some time my comments or posts stops working, sometime I can not mention any one in my reels by using @ sign, I cant save any audio, it shows temporary unavailable, what is this, make it correct"

I also tried to update it, yet, it's still the same. I hope you fixed this issue as soon as possible."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for a while now but suddenly I was very displeased with how they manage their account in terms of people not being able to log in back into an account that was hacked. I tried everything but it even makes you more frustrated with the app they really need to sort it out. I had to create another account since I couldn't use the first one with all my special memories.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Reels got broken, I can't scroll through the video to a point when INSTAGRAM INVOLUNTARILY REFRESHED my timeline so i got cut off from watching it. It's so frustrating, can you just not do it unless I SAY SO? goddamn it's not that hard. I can't scroll/skip the video because every tool/control disappeara and video freezes. I have to open it again and watch from the start."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is going down, if I didn't hold so many communications on this app I would never use it again. It just crashed for me and I can't log back in and before it crashed I wasn't able to look at any stories, reels or send messages. With every update it just gets worse."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Issue after issue, it's like the app isn't tested on different types of devices. Music doesn't play for my posts but the audio is still attached, sometimes it uploads pics where two pics are morphed together when they were individual two different pics not edited together og SOMEHOW??? And the social tab is always ""sometimes it shows up normal sometimes only username shows up so you reopen the app and then it goes to normal"" and sometimes I'll send a post but it'll ping me as if I received a mes"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app seems to be getting worse. I can't see anyone's stories and all it's saying is couldn't reload page. My mobile data, wifi everything works yet nothing seem to fix the situation. It's on your side where things are getting messes up. I have important audios that I use for my work on my dms but there seems to be a glitch here as well. Instagram please pull your socks up."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty buggy. Cant press the rewind or forward bars on videos, or it freezes the vid or gets rid of the bar. Scrolling through time-line bugs out, and it misses features that should be basic, despite being one of the most popular apps. So weird."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is there no settings system built in? When I'm looking at reels and the reel is done, it automatically scrolls to the next video without my intervention. I think there should be a feature that prevents that from happening. It's so pointless to auto scroll."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Dont know what the heck has gone wrong with your efforts into the optimisation and stability of this app but literally every video or reel now frezes, hangs or gets stuck infinitely loading. Clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, switching networks, no troubleshooting solves this issue. There's no point even trying to watch most videos anymore"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not able to turn off auto scrolling when watching reels. At the bottom of the page it will pop up with ""next reel playing in"" and it is very annoying to have things I'm looking at disappear.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app was fine until yesterday i suddenly got logged out of my main account and turns out many people had the same issue. i tried logging back into the account but everytime i tried using an authentication app with the correct code, it keeps saying ""ERROR please check your security code and try again"" like ITS already correct and i tried over and over multiple times already with different devices and diffirent networks, it just keeps neglecting the access. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram's implementing all this forced progress to the next thing ruins the enjoyment of the current thing. Some things that I watch are deep and require listening to multiple times in order to meditate on the message to simply come close to understanding it. Instagram doesn't care about the user's enjoyment of the content in which they follow. Instagram wants you to keep scrolling mindlessly unless you land on an ad. Because of this, I rate Instagram's leadership üñïüñïüñïüñïüñï"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram isn't letting me get into either of my accounts. I've reinstalled it on one of my devices, reset my password on 1 of my accounts, requested a log in link, tried to access it on my tablet.

Please try logging in again."", or ""We couldn't connect to Instagram. make sure you're connect to the Internet and try again."" Even when I am connected to the internet & I can't even contact them directly."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was working pretty well, but it was freezing a lot while trying to jump to different times in the video. That was fixed a bit ago but now you can not pause a video by tapping on it which was very convenient. You have to hold down which sucks after being able to just tap."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App has always been touchy & unintuitive. Coupled with the facts that you still can't reliably post from a browser on a computer & links aren't click able, Instagram is useless. I'm amazed it's popular at all with so many years-long limitations."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the last update, it has been bugging out. I'm not able to change the layout of the stories template, it just changes to a black screen.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram this new update prevents you from forwarding or backing up a video clips. NOW IT FREEZES!. You previously had that convenience why change and eliminate that? Sometimes we need to re-listen to something that was said... and now you have to start from the beginning to rewatch the entire thing. Please put that back in place!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The slider / scroll bar for watching videos - to go forward or back does not work. When I attempt to scroll forward in a reels video, this causes the video to pause and crash. This has been like this for 2-3 months. Please fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible experience. Meta verified is overpriced and doesn't work. The app shuts off by itself for no reason at all. Sometimes the music I add to my reels just keep playing in the background. Speaking of reels. Reels often stop completely. This app is garbage.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good one but there are few issues with d app & one of them which concerns me is- there should b some system or arrangement where we come to know that which effects are Instagram effects & which r 3rd party effects while making reels because most of the time when I try to boost d reel it gives me this message that it can't be boosted since d effects should be created by Instagram only. So there should be something which tells us about this since it takes a lot of hardwork for a reel.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lot of bugs and too many glitches!! We want back the mute option on reels , even now after the lastest update we can't rewind or take forward the reel properly ( this option was the best till now but its not working properly) It's my humble request to team Instagram to solve all the bugs and glitches! ASAP"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Inability to snooze suggested post ruined my experience. I practically want to uninstall the app after this update. This is just bad customer experience. I would not like to see suggested post on my timeline. For that I can simply go to Explore Page. This is just instagram forcing us to see literally anything and everything. Very Disappointed!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is this app just getting worse day by day? It's showing Couldn't refresh feed although I have a stable internet connection. Also the timeline under the reels isn't working, I've been logged out of my account around 5-6 times now... and now my dms aren't loading and I'm unable to send any messages...you really need to fix this asap... there's no other option left other than deleting this app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I added the Instagram app to my phone and signed up. Everything seemed fine for an hour. Then I received an email saying my account was suspended. I clicked through and now it's saying I have to add a mobile number. I did that, and clicked send code, only to repeatedly get the response ""code not sent"". Instagram help center provided no assistance."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram has been having MAJOR issues with the login! I also had 2 accounts connected to the same email but because you can no longer have 2 accounts on one email it has been completely difficult trying to gain access to the accounts. The worse thing to happen to Instagram is connecting to Meta. It sucks now.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very annoying that when I'm watching a reel, the screen keeps moving up & down, & the app tells me that I can swipe up for more reels. I've been using this app before reels existed. This is very destracting when I'm trying to stay focused on a reel, but then, my screen starts bouncing up & down. Bad design choice."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is getting increasingly hard to make stories and posts on. If you don't have an apple phone you can forget about having the latest updates! I just had an update and it undid all my profile links to Facebook Pages. One I cannot get linked back up because my two step verification code NEVER sends to me. I am fully blocked out of my own account in which I clearly have the login information for. I cannot run my business page successfully in this app anymore!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,New to Instagram but I like it. Would like to see support for portrait and landscape images though instead of just square. Also I noticed that the app doesn't seem to support animated GIF images. Please improve! Support for vertical and landscape video is good.

Seriously? I must uninstall and reinstall the app every time uploading a video stucks???..."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In ads, the comments are invisible. They should not be due to companies creating misleading ads (especially game ads). Whenever I go to edit a comment while I'm writing it and move my cursor to anywhere within it, as soon as I type a single character, the cursor jumps to the end of the comment. Stories from reels that are longer than 15 seconds will stop playing at the 15 second mark and just stay there instead of jumping to the next story."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I recently updated the app, and since then, I've had nothing but problems.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The toughness on actions like following and liking for new accounts is too severe and has created a very negative experience for me as an artist. Joining as an artist you naturally want to get established, connect with others and there is so much exciting art to like too. Being constantly punished just for being enthusiastic and for actions that instagram also pushes on you has been an awful experience for me. The total lack of communication too and all the hidden rules - just awful!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great social media app having extensive features but still some features can be added to make it more user friendly and enhance user experience like edit a comment. One feature that i think would be beneficial if added, is add or remove a song from the posted photos any time."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The AI spam detection has made this app so much less fun to use. I have zero violations but I'm not free to use my account because I said something NICE on a clothing companies account and it happens all the time. Not to mention the glitchiness of creating stories and anytime you're trying to post multiple photos, the app automatically resizes all of them after the first photo. This app is garbage."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram is a great app for communication with your pairs but the only reoccurring issue that I have been getting is that I'm only getting logged out of my account. It's only 4 in the evening and I've been logged out approximately 5 times! And also when I tried logging back in one time it told me the owner changed their password and I was unable to log in. Other than that issue Instagram has been working fine for me.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whatever recent update that instagram decided it was a good idea to make Reels autoscroll without a way to turn it off is super annoying. I'm starting to get really pissed off when I'm trying to read comments on a reel and I close the comments and it's moved like 4 reels on its own in the background.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love taking photos and videos in Instagram cos of it's filters by using my Samsung S Pen as my action button to take pictures and I find it really convenient. But after the recent update, I couldn't do it anymore. So sad that now I have to find another app to do it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have to keep uninstalling the app because it keeps freezing and won't scrole on my phone. I've done this three times now. Update: Instagram is terrible with reels and won't let me at a caption to them. I am absolutely fed up of this and I've been trying all day to add a caption and it just isn't happening.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nothing but issues. New posts disappear before you can like/ read them. Timeline no longer exists, it's either weeks old posts or bombarded by suggested posts. Have to go to persons profile page to see their new posts since they disappea. Freezes constantly.. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Saves original images to my phone even though I turned it off. Also , when you say J won't see that ad again, are you thinking I have short term memory loss because I see the same ones constantly."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many bugs recently, I posted ONE story and the view count froze then all my stories proceeded to disappear so I can't view my friends stories. Tried restarting my phone, redownloading the app and nothing worked. Can't even see if people replied to my story and messages won't go through. Please fix this issue."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has gone steadily downhill in the past two years. My reach has been killed. It barely shows my photos to anyone, even my followers. Hashtags hardly ever work. Guides are gone. Notification system and settings are terrible. I constantly have to redownload the app because of some glitch that prevents me from posting or using the app at all. All of my support requests are unanswered. I wish Instagram would stop trying to be TikTok or Twitter/X. Go back to being a cool photo sharing app!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is the resize function for this app so terrible? If you're posting multiple images, the pic automatically zooms and you can't adjust to fit screen. New update: story layer doesn't work on android (can't move text or pictures around). Very poor experience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Full of unexplained nudity. I can't even open this app up anymore without being shown some kind of explicit image of some lady showing off unwanted body images. I don't know how this is allowed. I fear opening up this app at work now. (Mostly from funny pages and sometimes the pages I follow that show cars or home decoration and tech.) Not to mention how many scammers are on this app as well. Something gotta change fast! And people are worried about tiktok smh
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps showing ""couldn't refersh feed"" although I have good cell service i tried clear cache and storage the app refuses to let me log in. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it does the same thing. I tired doing forgot password even though I didn't but I still won't send the confirmation code or email. This i really frustrating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You can add a translator feature for reels, either in text or audio format. Reels, such as podcasts or dramas, are often in different languages, and not everyone can understand every language. Therefore, having a translator feature would make it easier for users to understand them clearly."""
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app will literally not work. It worked for a good 4 months before it js stopped working. Like it won't load anything, I've tried logging out, but that doesn't work. It won't refresh. Like dawg, I can't even get past the login. I deleted the app and re-download it, I updated it, and my wifi works just fine. This app is tweaking. Also, someone keeps hacking all my friends' accounts. Idk it's just pissing me off. This app sucks üëéüèº"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated to the latest version, since i was forced to (got logged out and the app wouldnt let me login unless i update) The new version is a straight downgrade, sending a post to friends now has a horrible grid layout, which is awkward to use, ui is round and ugly(but that is subjective) app feels slower as well. A lot of annoying pop ups and redundant information. 66mb update for what? Atleast give people the option to customize these settings. Hate using the app now"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was great for sharing art and connecting with other artists . I got hacked a couple years ago so got locked out I've tried resetting with a password as suggested and never could so there's a problem . I haven't been able to access my account in two years so deleting it .
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why is it that everytime I try to edit my story it says ""Something went wrong, Error"" like I already had 8 attempts to upload a story yet all of them were unsuccessful. The amount of patience I have right now was depleted enough for me to submit this review. Please fix it it's kind of frustrating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've encountered difficulties resetting my password on Instagram and the process seems to be a hassle. They claim they can't send a reset link (We can't send a link to this number because of your security settings)leaving me stuck without a clear solution.It's frustrating when the purpose of credentials is defeated, making account security and login accessibility challenging. I request assistance with password reset issue using phone number as I have checked all help center solution but in vain."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The last update was horrible. You put a simple comment( no hate, no mean concept and nothing) and suddenly instagram remove it and then send you alot of notification and alert that ""we remove your comment"". Like OK? I got it in first alert why you send alot of alerts and not letting me see my page? And you can't do something at least to solve this problem. I'm sooo disappointed and angry because of it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Developers: A request has been made to add a filter on saved posts, just like liked posts. Although I can select posts based on date from those that I like, it would be nice if this feature extended to saved posts as well. For the next updates, please implement this process. This is the most needed and expected feature."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is a shame...! If you really want to help people have their business on social media, you should make it work properly. I installed and uninstalled so many times because is just not working...keeps blocking, doesn.t upload pictures, videos... is a waist of time and nervs. Yes is a good app, but it is not, if is not working!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really think that Meta doesn't want Instagram to work fine. Whenever this application would start working fine without any glitch, the same moment you'll get an update which will again bring tens of bugs. Now after the last update, my Instagram is getting logged out automatically but not my other account which is also there. It has happened 10-12 times in last day. The second bug I'm facing is that songs are not playing for some of my posts even though song name is written there. Stupid app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good platform for influencers, creators and small businesses.But there are many unexpected problems too.The app has way too much issues. There's always bugs now and then. Sometimes with messages, sometimes with uploading or even deleting a post or story.People send messages but I can't see in my inbox no matter how many times I refresh it even with proper internet connection. It could get much better if these issues get resolved."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate that it IMMEDIETLEY rings/videos someone if you accidently hit the button at the top - I slide down from the top right - and numerous times a week I accident press the phone or video call and there's not even any small gaps to cancel it, it IMMEDIETLEY rings that person! Give me a warning screen once I've pressed that button, or put it in the 'options part' when you've clicked the name. Top right corner should be to access a person's profile quickly from the chat. The UI is üëéüèº"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I try and post a video that is lined up with the audio, both on my story and on my feed (stories are especially bad for it) the video and audio become out of sync by a fraction of time- this is not good when you're trying to line up visuals to the beat of the music!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if it's an android thing.. but I am always having problems uploading reels and videos. They end up choppy, or once I post all of the text in the caption, it goes away, and I end up having to re do everything. The collaboration section still doesn't work for any of my videos. I'm getting tired of this app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Firstly I was unable to view anybody's vids or pictures sent in the chat which were taken by Instagram.. later on it even got worse and I couldn't see some of their pfp too.. and now it got to a point where it started showing 'error' and 'couldn't refresh page' and then later on when I though to delete this app and reinstall.. and when I tried to login my account it started showing 'an unexpected error occurred' I mean seriously!?
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is mostly fine. The last update broke this app for me. Constant freezing. When I try to fast forward through some videos they freeze. The most annoying thing is that I can't use gifs on comments. Like at all. They don't post what so ever. Fix it man.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nowadays , I couldn't open the particular reels sent to me by someone else. Whenever I click those reels , the app opens some other reels, which are not sent to me. This makes me frustrated every single time as this happens !!! Try to fix the problem at the earliest."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"STOP LOGGING ME OUT FOR NO REASON!! I'll just say that it's a nightmare to put more than one pic/vid in the same post cause Instagram won't let you fit them properly. You got either a really disproportionate zoom or a really bad quality. Can't even put covers on the videos without them disappearing. And while we're at it, can you remove thar feature of the posts down scrolling automatically when the video you're watching ends?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's an excellent app but with some major issues. Likes after ad are not included now in main post but show up in insights only so whats the need to spend on ad and promote my posts. Also stories are disappearing with some error message. I have reported this so many times. Please help resolve my issues asap. üôè
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"New updates are making it worse. I don't want to scroll by songs in the background of reels. I don't want more suggestions in my main feed. I'll go to search. I don't see posts from friends I follow until several days later, but new folks I follow, I'll see their stuff from weeks ago before? That makes no sense. Set it back to how it was 2 years ago. The additional ads are getting to where I'm considering tik tok so I can see the content of folks I actually follow as they post them."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dear instagram, STOP showing me posts/reels from pages I don't follow. For every 2 posts from pages I follow I have to see an ad post and another from a recommended page. And once I click on a certain reel, I enter an infinite horizental realm of unlimited random short video. One cannot be aware what his friends and followed pages are posting anymore without scrolling a decent amount frequently. Instagram was a fun, now it is a black hole that sucks the attention of distracted people."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They've added a ""feature"" where it will auto-advance your reel after it repeats 3 times. Many have shown annoyance with this feature and have asked Instagram to remove it or, at least, add an option to turn that nonesense off. It has fallen on deaf ears so far."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I been using IG since it hit. Experience is mostly what you imagine & like seeing. Facebook always makes me feel depressed, but I laugh & catch up on sports here. Met & chat with some known figures, got replies, or 100 likes on funny comment. ; The Main feature i miss was the IGTV, rotate widescreen view. I installed an old version & it worked but was missing newer features. A bit more traffic to scroll by your new post would be a nice touch i'd suggest. Tik Tok does that well & shows result."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know where to start, I hope the developer teams use IG themselves so they can understand more where to fix. Let's just start with the cropped reels. Recently the reels no longer show their full size & significant spaces cropped from original posted ones while users want to share the full details inside the reels."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the most recent update reels aren't functioning properly. The current reel will skip to an entirely random reel with no warning or confirmation. You also cannot return to the original reel, as pressing the back button returns you to the feed which automatically refreshes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Android app is failing to detect proper inputs such as opening comments when the share button is pressed (or anywhere on the screen is pressed for that matter) It's also operating very oddly such as showing comments for the previous video when a subsequent video has been scrolled to. Or simply doing nothing at all (rejecting all input when a button or region of the video is pressed to prompt an activity) Also commenting fails randomly without retry
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So the Meta AI features just showed up on my version of the app and they quite frankly suck. There's no option to disable the feature which is whatever until you scroll on your feed and the Meta search bar STAYS ON THE SCREEN. The chat bot set up for the AI also shipped with zero instructions - I tried asking it how it can be turned off and the first answer it always gave was ""press the three horizontal lines"" in the search bar or chat screen"" only for there to not be such a thing in either."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app gets worse day by day. The community is trash. The updates make 0 sense. And it's just sad. As an artist, the fact that a once photography related app is now just only advertising weird ppl in reels is so strange. That's for TikTok to have, why can't u focus on the thing that made Instagram, Instagram. I've had it for almost 5 years. It was fun while it lasted I guess."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i enjoy posting on Instagram a lot! especially when I can use the music feature. however, i wish that there is an option to add music to something I've already posted, whether it's a post with multiple photos or a single photo post. i think that this feature would be something a lot of other people would enjoy using as well. Update: i love the new pong game that got added! it's so fun typing an emoji and then just playing pong when waiting for someone to respond"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for social media, but it's extremely buggy. Skipping time in reels breaks the entire video, im unable to report or delete comments, Dms are malfunctioning too. Edit: Stop moving around buttons. I want posting to my story to be the first button I see for priority reasons. Not other social medias."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Loats of buggs like uploading errors. UI/UX of this app needs major improvements like scrolling through chats and searching for spesific word or date. Also, stories needs to be more efficient and user friendly for creative people. Constantly have to work around to find a solution. Also, layering elements is still not on android!!üò±"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very good app for stress relief and mindfulness. But I want to give suggestion to Meta page that If I want to see the reel which I saw in previous days and it is not saved, why don't the instagram page can develop history based option which we can see same reels again currently."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. My previous account was deleted bc of a stupid issue which wasn't solved, I lost 29 important posts. But apart from all that, the app is great, the chatting and the reels are all really good. Pretty much similar to Face book but some settings like the close friends one is absolutely genius."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Would have given it a five if my stuff was reaching people like it's supposed to certainly not a lack of effort on my part. Not only is my page verified but we still seem to have my location set up in Virginia and I live in New York that doesn't make any sense either. Also another thing I've already rated you guys and I keep getting notifications while on the app to rate you why does that keep happening. I'm also paying for ads so I wish my views and profile visits would be distributed correctly
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's wrong with Instagram these days.When I posted a video on the story, suddenly the story took a long time to load and couldn't upload it, the problem was I had to delete it so I could re-upload it, but I didn't have a backup because I uploaded it directly to the story without saving it first. I'm afraid that if I want to upload something to a story, I have to save it on my cellphone first. Then when I uploaded it to the story, suddenly there was no trace of it in the 'archive'"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Constant blocks when tagging friends. Now I can't even get to my help menu to let Instagram know that sending me a notice that two comments have been removed is causing a major glitch where I can get to my normal page it just keeps sending back to the warning. I'd really like to know how tagging a couple of friends goes against community standards. I'd tell people it's not worth the hassle. It's just progressively got worse.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app works fine for consuming content. However, posting content from a Google Pixel is very challenging.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Posts and reels must be at least shared to all the followers. Also this is a place for creators. It seems that trending audios are pushed more easily than a different new one. I think background audio should bot be a criteria for pushing the video. This would temt creators to use existing trending audios whereas there could be a possibility for a better creation..
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am having a similar issue as I am watching reels that the progress load bar disappears, which makes it no longer for me to skip forward, I have to go outside the video and come back in. The reels that would replay by themselves will skip to the next video without me doing it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please sort the reels out. Just fit the photo/video to the screen so it makes it flow a lot easier. We're not all videophotographers. This app is for everyone not influencers who have all the time in the world to create masterpieces.

Everything was working just fine why the sudden change?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Quit updating and changing things that don't need to be changed. Why give us to mute buttons for reelz just to take them away and replace it with that god awful pause button like with Facebook. Worse design choice I've seen, every time from y'all. Smh. Not only that it kicked my out of an account saying it's not an account?? And that there's an error when I try to log in. Bro what ever."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been an instagram user since 2014 and I've never felt compelled to write a review until now. I've been mostly happy with the app until the most recent update. It has ostracized photographers and emphasized ""tiktok"" like content instead. Stop forcing reels and shopping down my throat. Stop deleting my drafts, and give me back the option to save one for later. Stop showing me ads every 3rd post. Show me the posts of the accounts that I follow, because that's WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Even after the new update, I am not able to upload my desired song on story or post, I have uninstalled and installed it or done all the troubleshooting in the other Instagram users. All features are available but I am a user who does not have any features. I have checked all the settings, no changes have been made in them."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like to use this app for my stories. But recently I have went elsewhere when creating content. The fonts do not allow me to make a transparent cover and it's bothering me so much! I have a Samsung galaxy s23 ultra and I really with they would fix the recent updates.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to delete the app because I wasn't getting notifications, I downloaded it again and since yesterday it won't let me enter the app. I have already restarted my phone several times, uninstalled the application and reinstalled it, and still the app still does not work. You would do me a big favor if you fix that error."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible algorithm and too many bots. EDIT: App gets worse every month, right now I can't even create stories without my images being distorted after posting. Stories of the people I follow disappear after watching and are replaced with suggested follows, which has to be the dumbest idea ever. My DMs are suddenly...stretched to the other end of the screen? I'm starting to wonder if the devs got an AI to spit out UI design suggestions, that's how bad they are."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Any solutions on how to update messaging to Messenger across all of my accounts? There's no button to update messaging... Edit: Kept trying to call my girlfriend on this app. Kept crashing. If it crashes one more time after I update it, I will make it my mission to flood your servers with one star reviews until your entire system crashes beyond recovery. Edit 2: Can't remix reels without crashing. Can't watch reels without crashing. You know what happens next."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The amount of problems recently is crazy. More often than not the post button will completely disappear, the reels play out of sync, and chat backgrounds just disappear, and you have to put an on and off setting for those haptics"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bug1. Unable to move the reels to partucular time. It stopped and again started from the same place. Bug2. I turn off my active status. When I put a notes status which comes in message section, then I active status is visible to everyone."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I follow all rules and regulations but whenever I try to live it says your account is not eligible to use this feature please try again later.... Even after update still not working i even report this bug twice but nothing happen. Why don't they fix it... I would recommend to stop this instgram apps and prefer other apps because Feedback and report is useless just a waste of time... They should know that there are lots of people who really love to use Instagram app but they couldn't due to bug
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Don't know why I haven't been able to play reels on my Android. The Icon has disappeared and even after reinstalling it comes once but it doesn't play reels at all, a blank screen appears. And the icon vanishes when app is closed and opened again. Pathetic. fixed now hence editing and updated rating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What's wrong with Instagram lately? I could be scrolling through the the search feed and after a few minutes the posts will all be whiteout and you can't view anything. Video wouldn't play, photos can't be viewed. I have to close the app completely and reopen in order to use the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Having a lot of bugs in the application while using the most common bug is refresf feed & network request failed please try again after some time.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is no support or someone to talk to if you are experiencing troubles with your app. It just redirects you to the page where it's information and links that don't work. The app support is subpar, it's super frustrating to appeal or reach anyone to resolve issues. Do better."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3/1/2024: UPDATE 11/1/2022.. Great to use to get your request / message / info out in Meta world!! Good to keep up with gossip {results & info depends on who you follow} Pitfalls: Can be very hard to find your own friends -- Way too many look-a-like accounts, easy to follow wrong one -- Difficult to navigate they need to add a help page indicating use of the many many icons Overall: I would reccommend!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good social platform, not a lot of scams, Instagram does a very nice job to make sure privacy, and security for the most part is safe, but I did have someone make an account of me asking for money to my friends. Would be careful and recommend putting your account on private so you avoid situations like that. Nice for kids to communicate through and is safe. You are able to chose to view things you are sent, nice to post your adventures."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lots of Bugs... If I watch want to move ahead to the middle of reel, the reel gets struck. It won't continue. Nor the scroll bar is visible. Have to scroll to next reel and come back to it. Also the scroll bar of the reel doesn't appear. Update just made the app worse."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes, messages show up in my notifications but not in the app when I check. I also found that sometimes voice messages don't send and that past messages don't load after a bit. However, it's a really great app and is overall really fun despite the occasional glitch."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UNUSABLE. I only use to watch videos and have never shared any content. I do occasionally comment on videos. The past two days, I've been SPAMMED with notifications that block my screen, saying ""My content was removed for spamming duplicate videos."" I can't even get past the notification screen!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app's getting worse by the time I update. For example, I can't even see my story archives since January 2024 until these days and nothing has been recorded after checking it. Other than that, this app features aren't accessible and applicable for a few accounts. Last and most important, some accounts easily got hacked with no in-handy aid from Instagram, especially for them who already build up their branding on IG."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram is really a good platform at all but..... From few days I'm facing some problems with it and the worst thing I experienced today was when I'm opening my insta the profile page is still loading and I had gotted some messages but when I click on the message symbol the messages doesn't appear only and I even can't see others reel story post and many more and I had putted a reel on uploading from hours but still its on pending and not completing! Worst experience Instagram pls work on this

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My built-in Instagram app is missing on my phone. No shortcut, not even on the phone's list of app. It's totally had hidden itself after an update. The only way to open it, which is odd, is by clicking ""open"" button on google play store."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Pretty great app I've had my account for a long time but issue is I can't see other people's notes or even have that feature to make a note. Lately I've been having issues with it too because it won't let me post story's with music in them.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its like Instagram is trying to make leave the platform, its a good platform but some of their updates give alot of bugs such as i cant see previous comments, reply to a comment and it disappears, you cannot skip 10 seconds of a video without the video freezing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cant get the audio to work for some resson while uplosding video... 70% of a video is theu auditory feedback and its been like this for at least a year. How do they not fix a bug like that for a whole year, do they want ppl going back to the silent film era or something."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram's interface is excellent, but reel uploads frequently suffer from delays, detracting from the user experience. Despite this flaw, the app remains popular for its user-friendly design and diverse content. However, despite its many strengths, the app does have some drawbacks, particularly when it comes to uploading reels. Users have reported experiencing delays and lags when trying to upload reels"

Reals run fine but the comments are kinda unhinged sometimesü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Good app, it's good for entertaining and waisting hours of my day. (Edit: uhhhh, it logged me out and says there is an ""unexpected error"" and that it ""cannot refresh feed"" or some shi. Can't log back in so tried making new account, didn't let me. Instagram pls fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad experience from last few days. I have to restart or relogin to view reel because it's stops in middle. Whenever reacts to story it's ask me to update the app which is already up to date. I see people are live but when I go to see live they are not because they where live much time ago. Really this is disgusting.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"albeit there might be some issue on content recommendations being clearly randomized sometimes which means i had to cache reset every few weeks, i'd say instagram is literally one of the best social media out there, why? quite simple, my internet is absolutely horrenduous, a little ping spike and i'm done from almost any internet. But in instagram, even in the worst of rains, instagram somehow works fine as if i'm living in Japan. Truly an instagram moment."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever I wanted to give it a 0 star rating but I cannot what kind of joke is this it's always crashing the app most of the time I open the app it starts glitching I can't upload any photos or videos too even if I try it always in the middle of the process and it never ends unless I delete the app and install it back and what the hell is wrong with songs why are they only unavailable only for my account?? Please fix this asap !!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many issues main one being that when I try to make a post it blacks out my pictures or half of my pictures so I can even post anything and when it doesnt do that when I am able to upload them it says theres an error posting. whats the point if I cant even use it it also doesnt actually save my drafts so I usually have to restart a post over and over
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Garbage the worst app as a new user I have ever tried to use. All frills but can't do the basics. Absolute trash. Don't waste your time unless you're a masochist. Allows you to post the same video 10 times then says there's a 10 post maximum. Never mind I was trying to post different vids. programmers should be shot. Round up the whole software development team and drown them in a sceptic tank. Not even joking. If you're a new user, just uninstall the app right now. Save yourself the aggravation"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Watching a video. Make the video full screen. Screen goes black in the middle of video due to inactivity. Tap screen. Video is gone. Have to start 4 minute video over. No fast forward feature. Leave a review. Add fast-forward for videos Keep screen alive when watching videos
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The pinning option is full of bugs. I cant pin anything to my reels grid. Every time it says your reel has been pinned and then nothing changes. tried pinning other reels but it was the same. I have reported this many times in the app and still no fix. Not a good support üëé
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"These past updates have made the app virtually useless. I can't post to my story, I can't see other's stories, trying to fast forward on reels freezes everything, and I constantly get a ""Couldn't refresh feed"" message every time I open the app. Absolute dog water."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Privacy concern: Contacts exclusive to whatsapp are showing as suggested and this app has no permissions enabled.

Facebook developers, you are terrible!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With every update, the app gets worse. With today's update, I can no longer skip reels or directly share reels with my followers. I have to manually enter their name every time I wanna share with them. A pop-up menu used to appear whenever I hit the share button, it no longer exists."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lags. Stops playing reels randomly. Terrible UI. Sound button on reels, automatic scroll after a reel has played once, scrolls so that the next reel is in full view so cannot scroll in the middle of two reels so can't read big captions, and many other terrible features. Also randomly crashes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My instagram this morning has just completely stopped working nothing loads nor sends and when I went online to look for help nothing worked I have deleted and reinstalled the app cleared the cache and data and tried to re-log in however now it just comes up with a different error message stating problems on their end and to try again which does not change no matter how many times I try to log back in.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have met with so many bugs. Sometimes i cannot even see what's written because of the bug. Nothing shows. Very slow loading. My story aren't going clear. Blurry. Loading issues. Black and white colour issues with captions.

This issue has persisted consistently, and despite various attempts to troubleshoot on my end, I have been unable to resolve it. Although it's working in other mobile phone. Everytime I've to change my password, use gmail to recover account than use two factor authentication apps, why is it happening??"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Awful UI. Full of bugs. App always changes for the worse. Discovering new content or being discovered as a small artist or business is next to impossible due to the garbage algorithm. only negative experiences with the app for the past 5 years.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix your endless scroll in following & dm list, it keeps reloading first page over and over again. Its been like that for so long. And theres a new bug now where you cant move the reels' timestamp, if you try to move it, it will just break the video and got stuck."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recent bugs that have gone uncorrected for over a week or so. no longer able to seek through any video content without the app crashing. If this continues to be the case I'll probably uninstall and move onto something else.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think last update was better than the recent one. During the previous update after clicking on the reels it was pausing and separate mute option was visible on the right top corner. But in the recent update it came back to the mute after clicking and for pausing long continuous press on screen.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Advancing through reels is no longer working. I seldom look at an entire reel. I look at the beginning, then scroll right to see the result. I hope this is a glith and not intentional. If it remains this way, I will no longer watch reels. This is a waste of time."

Everytime i tried to log back in, everytime i tried to make highlights it doesn't have many options and also my followers doesn't increase when i follow someone's account and it doesn't appear on my account. This is ridiculous. Pls fix this mess insta. Fix all those bugs. And i won't change my review until it's all fixed up"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is not functioning properly. Sone of the features are hardly visible... for example the ""follow"" button is now appearing like a white button. Photos or videos I'm saving are not showing up anywhere on the device."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy watching content about photography, cars, aviation, guns, and all kinds of other cool things. The algorithm is an absolute dumpster fire. Instead of getting the usual things I enjoy watching, I get videos of people getting killed in some horrific manor or I get a bunch of naked women or, worst of all... political propaganda. There is that, plus if you comment ""shoot"" or ""gun,"" your comment can get you banned. Their guidelines are wack as hell, and their algorithms are obnoxious."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dark mode for my samsung s9+ is horrible (background will constantly revert to white blocks.. but text stays white so you can't read anything etc), a bunch of functions (like ""posts I've liked"") are hard to find/poorly organized.

The options are not even working, especially the SMS login code and Facebook access they keep erroring, and I didn't receive a text code. When I try to get support and do a video selfi to confirm my identity, it wasn't accepted, and it keeps on rejecting my video selfies. I didn't know where I could get the backcode, so I can't log in to my account for months"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Another social networking app. I find Instagram slightly complex when it comes to use & navigation. Add friends, comment, like/unlike, stories & more. Similar to it's original predecessor Facebook only seems to have an extra level of privacy, & content is more so user defined or customised."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What is happening. I wanted to make a new account so I can post edits and after I finished making the account a white screen would pop up and close by itself and would say we limit smth idk. It was nearly impossible to sign out Edit: I barely managed to switch accounts by double clicking the pfp icon rapidly, when there wasn't the white screen (every 0.6 seconds) there would be the notification pop up. If you wanna make a new account be careful not to lose the other ones in the process."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Some functions have to be improved! Mobile app always crops your images to another aspect ratio unlike the webpage! Very unclear how to use certain functions such as reply to comments in a DM or not letting your posts sorted into some kind of folders (you can only put stories into story highlights). There's lots of work to do!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't understand why this app gives us the option to snooze suggested posts on our feed for 30 days, when it does nothing and I'm still getting them, even with the setting re-enabled. My Instagram is up to date too, so this doesn't make any sense. Seems pretty counterintuitive to me üòï"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are a couple of issues with the Instagram app. Firstly, I can't drag the video forward using the progress bar; it disappears when I try. Secondly, I'm receiving friend suggestions in the notification section even when there are no actual notifications. Please address these problems."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update- i can use it as intended except for it freezing most of the time when i try to share a story. Which means i have to restart the app and probably not find the story again Wont let me comment, but it says my account is normal. No limitations,no warnings,etc. I tried reporting it to get help, but there has been no response. I think im just gonna delete my account at this point. I used to love this app. Went from 5 to a 1 star in a few days"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As an android user, it's very frustrating uploading multiple pics in a post. The editing and fit of the photos are always out of the frame. That's the only complaint I have. Otherwise, app is good."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Since the last app update on my Google Pixel 6A the Instagram videos have started stuttering and full of lags when I use Bluetooth headphones. When I disconnect them the videos play just fine. This doesn't happen with any other social media or video streaming app.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I got logged out randomly today from all of my accounts and can no longer log back in. I checked my email and nothing changed with my account. I can still log in on my browser. This app is broken. Update. Day 2 of not being able to log in. This might finally be the push I needed to quit this app for good.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app has major issues while editing reels. I edited a reel successfully with the text to speech feature only to find that the text somehow got overlapped and all the text is spoken at once. I did this two times wasting my time and was frustrated.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible usability, switching to web. Resets new posts unless they are published. Cannot find saved drafts. Always goes to Recent, forcing me to scroll through thousands of WhatsApp pictures. Sometimes an 'unknown' error occurs - hello, this is 21st century!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have it, but ONE thing keeps me from using it... i have to tell it NOT to crop my picture to square when i post a photo. Maybe there's a quick fix, but an app that touts bein primarily for photos shouldn't edit mine by default when i post it. I shouldn't have to tell it to post all of my photo. As a semi-professional, to me that's like a slap in the face."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Y'all ruined the app can't fast forward or rewind videos anymore it's like what did y'all do it's frustrating I literally just left Instagram after trying all day to watch all kinds of videos and it just don't allow you to fast forward or rewind it just literally freezes up and I have to exit the app
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,New app update can't use photos or videos from my SD card. That is where all my videos are stored. Cannot make anymore Reels or stories.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Synchronization with FB doesn't work properly (can't find my friends from FB here); my old stories are absent from the archive, even though the option is always on, let alone those annoying layout restrictions for posts when they're all cut universally either horizontally or vertically"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Latest update made the issue with the feed refreshing much worse. It's constantly refreshing when scrolling and clicking out of the app (not closing it). Very annoying and can't keep up with posts. Also routinely shows posts that are 4 - 5 days old & videos are buggy/freezing.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Now there is a lot of bugs in Instagram. While watching the reels it's getting stopped, while seeing the story it's showing entire black screen and sometimes it gets stopped for no reason. I suggest you to improve the quality of your developers. As a developer I have a respect to meta team, now it's getting down."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Since I downloaded this app I'm having problems. Stops refreshing or working every once in a while. In addition to this keeps asking me to add my birthday date, but if I don't want to do it I can't access to my account. My solution is keep uninstalling and downloading again and again, every time it doesn't work. Such a poor app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app needs an update. Videos from a carousel (multiple post- post) that I click on shows a black screen which causes me to swipe left then back to the video so it can play. Another issue I'm having is the slider at the bottom of videos. Anytime I try to fast forward or rewind a video using the slide bar at the bottom, it causes the video to freeze. I've already unistalled and reinstalled the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This platform is among the ones with the most awful programming in history. The algorithm is a mess, I tell it a million times that I am not interested in certain types of content, that I'm uncomfortable even, and it keeps forcefeeding me with that. Also, add another ""not interested"" option: I don't even speak the language. I get so many posts in languages I don't speak, it's beyond annoying and ridiculous. And do something about the bots for once, it's unbearable"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall I really appreciate about the features and all the stuff included in this version but kindly being an Instagram addict I request your team to fix the issue of whenever the user goes offline kindly please it shows like they are online for 7 minutes please fix these because of this issue I got more trust issues with my loved ones üôè it's an humble request from my side by the way thanks for such a great platform ‚ú®üíù...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have some suggestions for the developers of Instagram app who's job is to enhance certain basic features, 1. Please put a sort and filter option in saved posts /reels just how it is in the ""liked posts"" , it makes user's life easierrr. 2. Bring back the ""share comment"" option. 3. Please make a feature to copy the comment as well (this is very useful when trying to copy and paste links)."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I think Instagram should help to add pictures after posting cuz' someone will forget to add some pictures while posting the pictures.. so even after posting instagram should bring an editing option so we can add extra pictures and with delete option..I hope they'll bring up this feature soon.. pls bring that feature soon..
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Changing to one star. For MONTHS there is a bug after bug with each update. It's getting ridiculous. It is always something in regards to reels. And now they don't even work, app just crashes when you open any reel. AWESOME JOB GUYS"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""What the hell now"" is all I can say. The comment, like, and share buttons all pause the video.

Any little thing you do or say gets you in trouble in this digital prison.... every post is an ad. it's a waste of time trying to use this app. Generally speaking, nothing about this app works very well at all..

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"UPDATE: Since the below review insta developers fixed my issue super quickly, thanks! Follow button invisible - a bug? When I click 'follow' the button goes invisible instead of changing to 'following', so this may be an android bug? Also if I click follow to a private account, the button is again invisible and there is a blank space where the button should change to say 'requested'. I have experimented with tests to see if logging in and out or reinstalling might fix the issue, but no."

Please create an option for public pages to set certain posts and stories to private, for followers only. Some of us may want to make more connections in this world but do not want to create a new public account, and want to maintain the account's posts that are private. However we do not want to archive our posts to keep it hidden either, but only for followers to see. Facebook has had this option for a long time already. Thanks"

But now, those video posts turn into reels. It doesn't look right. And just other things. IG should have a whole day or week, where people can say what they dislike or like about IG.

So if you don't know if your account gets deleted you just have to live with the anxiety that you could lose access to it any minute. What's also infuriating is randomly getting notifications for comment removal because ""of suspected spam"" may as well throw the whole app into the abyss"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app but I'm addicted to it so I can't let go. Otherwise, too much adverts and I never see content from people that I follow. Just one suggested post after another. The explorer page shows same post's dated 2-3yrs ago."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Weird issues with photos not showing to allow me to upload. Folders make no sense and don't match my phone's folders, photos showing a strange mix of images and not in date order. Defeats the point of a photo sharing app if you can't share your photos..."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is 2/5 because it had so many bugs... A LOT. I can't send voice messages at all, clearing search history does not change search results, chat screen glitches, etc... I am very happy with how they respond to reports. They deleted someone who was blackmailing me immediately and I'm highly grateful. Unfortunately, 9/10 spam accounts are Indian or Nigerian. Still, it is very entertaining and I usually manage using it fine. Now the reels are bugging"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram was great until 2022... It glitches out for everything and it doesn't matter if I restart my phone, Uninstaller then reinstall... I just get random error messages. I don't even get to create LIVE stories because of that"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it used to work pretty well, but for a few weeks now it's been very challenging to load things? most posts, stories, and messages take quite a while to load and often don't at all. i don't have this issue with any other webpage or app so i doubt my own Internet connection is the issue"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has glitches every week, every month. Sometimes the saved filters are gone, sometimes having problem in sharing stories, choosing pictures.üòë Otherwise it's a great app.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can not do anything when looking at videos. All the buttons to like, send, or look at comments stopped working. Can't even look at the descriptions anymore. It's great how a big company puts out an update and doesn't ensure it works."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE algorithm. The UI functions well, but the algorithm ignores your feedback to continually show you ""trending"" topics, which are usually aggressive controversial videos, mass-produced memes, pranks, and horny AI art. The other thing it does is bury both individual user's posts and any hashtags you follow. All fixed by giving the user a chronological feed of followed users and an explore feed of followed hashtags. Easy fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Figured I'd try Instagram finally. My feed or whatever is nothing but violence against kids/animals, violent auto accidents, tons of videos in languages I don't speak for some reason, explicit and sexual images, and I could go on. Why would anyone ""enjoy"" this is beyond me, but keep it tf away from me. My sensitivity settings are ""normal"" (middle option)."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Within the past few months the app has been horrible. Multiple comments I've made were immediately labeled as spam and blocked from being posted when they didn't violate any of their policies or include solicitation. I've been blocked from commenting on multiple occasions but all it says is that they'll limit certain functions for the sake of their community. What? It also constantly glitches or freezes randomly. I've reached out to them about it before and gotten no response.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Currently facing many technical problems. The biggest being the censorship of my account and inability to reach my own followers. I now reach between 100-200 of my fans per post which happened in the span of a few updates on the app when on average I was reaching at least 1k-1.5k per post. The inability to point out these algorithm errors to Instagram and actually communicate with someone is a travesty in and of itself. Livelihoods are being destroyed without any form of recourse.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"None of my messages were sending. Uninstalled, then reinstalled and now can log in. Tried going to help page it's not sending me any confirmation codes and says my emial/number and username are wrong or not found. I was just logged in!

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It now shows people that I don't follow when I watch all stories of my friends. I have a limited number of people who's stories I watch and this update really annoys me. I already accidentally followed unfamiliar people several times because of this garbage. So I had to find them in my list to unsubscribe. It looks like Instagram is already a dead horse. It started dying when they bought it, and now they finished it. Do anybody have any idea, what social network to use now instead of this?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram web is giving such a pain. All the time I login it says to change the password. In almost all logins.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What's the point of the favorites feature if they aren't coming up first! Also, on the homepage, half of the posts I'm scrolling through aren't even people I follow. It's either ads or a bunch of suggestions (which is curated to me, so not as bad, but at least let me see the people I'm actually following first). They don't even notify me anymore for the people I do want notifications from when they post."

It's been months now since I have this issue. Is it ever going to be fixed? Or am I being punished for bad behaviour here? I have no issue loging into my iPhones or iOS devices, but apparently that's not the case for Android. P.S: This used to be such a great app for photographers until Zuckie got his hands on it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a great app but went down a horrible path. Everything needs to be a reel now, which doesn't even function properly. Normal harmless comments get taken down regularly for spam, but actual bot comments are under every post. The amount of hate you can find, inform of comments but also posts, and no matter how often you try to block the accounts and say you're not interested, it keeps showing up. There is also not a proper support, idk why."

Not only did they not help me in recovering my account but did not even disable the account. Meanwhile the hacker kept using my account and misleading my followers while engaging in identity theft. No efforts have been made to assist me so I am quite disappointed.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They've changed the app so you can't see recent posts. That means the only content I can see is from irrelevant influencers who posted days ago and it rarely changes. I have no reason to use this if I'm unable to browse the content I want because they're trying to force feed me sponsored content
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a veryy good platform to show your talent and get to know about world that what people are doing or what is trending nowdays.

It is no longer a photo sharing app, I miss the times where I would just follow my friends and see their posts. Now its becoming a habbit of doom scrolling (endlessly scrolling for content). I hate seeing posts from people that I have no interest in, you used to be able to snooze suggested posts now they are constantly on my feed. Instagram is designed to be addictive."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taking out the festure of being able to see new posts in hashtags was a really bad decision. Each update seems like it only makes the app worst and adds things nobody asked for. Especially now with how they took off the tags tab and integrated it with the main feed tab. It's awful. There's no way to see newer posts, essentially killing niche tag posts by filling the top of the page with years old content. Even popular tags it's the exact same, but it hurts smaller tags more."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So you can't see the full extent of your comments as you write them due to the text box being so small, and you STILL can't edit your comment after posting because for some reason the software designers for ig think that feature is unnecessary even though EVERY other social media platform has it. Way to go ig. yet another way to be the most annoying app ever."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fun fact! Instagram will sometimes disable some of your functionality without telling you. I recently discovered that people are no longer able to follow my account even though I supposedly have access to all features.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm extremely frustrated with Instagram for constantly removing my comments. Due to the platform's limited comment space, I often compose my comments elsewhere and then copy-paste them onto Instagram. However, Instagram flags this as spamming, which is incredibly frustrating. Although I appreciate the app's functionality, I strongly dislike this aspect of it."

And another thing: Why am I barred when following accounts? I follow less than 3,000 accounts and according to the settings, I'm able to use all the features that you offer yet I cannot follow anyone, I get a notice telling me so to prevent misuse."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I loved Instagram because of photography and the connections formed with others. I tolerated the bad UI changes, and reels integration. But what I can't stand is random Threads posts on my feed from xenophobic and hateful people, who get boosted by other like minded individuals because of how engagement feeds the algorithm. It's a terrible design. Threads was supposed to be better than Twitter. Keep Threads feeds and Instagram posts seperate."

I don't know how many times a day you expect someone to 'verify' themselves when using a 3rd party app. I get the first time, maybe the second. But not everytime guys. This consistent logging out and verifying is ridiculous. You're not a bank so there's definitely no need for this endless hoop jumping just to look at your own account. You MUST do better guys. Instagram is being left behind as far as social media is concerned."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app needs some serious maintenance, everywhere. It's so glitchy and annoying omfl. The devs need to employ some people to work on general quality of life features. Firstly, DMs don't even show up sometimes until days later or I refresh 5 times. Great for business that. Secondly, I post stories and add them to my highlights only to find surpriiise insta never added it to the highlight. And for some reason they can't be found in my stories archive either. Thirdly, this is basically TikTok now"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's works fine but sometimes it shows waiting for network for certain reels and posts. When trying to switch between two accounts it turns blue and white and gets blurred. Pls do something abt it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Won't allow me to login, nor even perform the forget password & create new account options. It keeps getting stuck in a never-ending loading cycle when I try to log in. For the other options, it will appear as if the button was clicked, but the screen stays on the login front page with no changes."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"God awful moderation. You can literally state a factual statement, and if it gets reported or ""flags the correct terms,"" it'll be removed regardless of what it says with no way of repealing. Eventually resulting in account limits or termination. An example is ""wedding photos are pointless"" and that got removed for ""trying to receive fake likes"" tf does that even mean."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very pathetic experience with the reels uploading. Every time I failed in uploading reels from the Instagram mobile application. Although I have updated it but still not working. Very disappointed

Instagram please do something for me to complete the two steps because I'm so confused right now. Instagram is a confusing app.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I was going through the reelsvand wanted to add it on my story but as a user experience finding the option is adding extra work in it. Also as User interface present icons aren't visible. Please look into it #instagramteam

I thankfully was able to log back in, but I have no idea what I did wrong. I got no notification that someone else was trying to log into my account. I rely on this app to communicate with family and friends, so I would appreciate it if anyone would get back to me and let me know how this can not happen in the future??? Apparently, I'm not the only one who's had this issue."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hello Instagram, please stop listening to calls and reading our chat data because if someone feels depressed, you suggest more videos related to depression, even if we talk to someone on phone call, you listen to everything we say And when we open Insta, you get suggestions about what we talked about on the call. And I changed my interest options many times but nothing happened And you are the biggest reason of every man who got depressed. It's totally unfair"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Took forever to get my verification code. Then when I try to follow/ follow people back it is not letting me due to ""limitations"". Will not let me follow more than 50 accounts in over 24 hours since I set up my own account. No support team either is really shady. Looks like both of the issues I have are absolutely rampant with users as well and a lot of the times it never gets fixed. Absolutely ridiculous."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't even skip through the minute long videos like I used to. You can't even scroll to a different video and scroll back to restart the previous video you were watching. This new update is useless. I remixed one of my videos from my PUBLIC account onto my other, I woke up one morning, and it said my original video couldn't be remixed anymore, and they took down my remix on my other account which had almost 1,000 views btw."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app needs a small change for me. Give as an option to change the theme of the chat so we can add whatever picture we like through our device album and change the colour of the texts too to whatever we like. I think it would be a great feature to add to Instagram
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a frustrating application with 0% customer care service. I reported my fianc√©e post by accident, and till now, my issue hasn't been resolved. Also, now my account is restricted for unobvious reason, too. It's very overwhelming because we use social media to entertain ourselves. Instagram is making me sad. I deactivated my account until further notice. Please solve those problems for me and all insta people all over the world."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like Instagram overall and it's community but the reason I'm giving this a one star is because It logged me out of my actual account and when I try to recover it and try to send a verification code to my email it says it will take a minute and I end up waiting an hour and even though I enter the correct password it continues to say it's not the right password and I have to create a new account.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unusable. Most story functionality doesn't work anymore. In addition, the spam filter is out of control. You can make even the most benign comment but sometimes if you even have a badly placed word - like ""instagram"" -the auto flagging algorithm will remove your comment. No one will ever get back to you about it either. I've just stopped commenting on friends' posts altogether - never know if one ""Good luck!"" comment will be my last. Convinced no actual humans work at this company anymore."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app but I would really like the feature of changing names and being able to scroll in the chat smoothly without taking so long plus I would like it if the searched message didn't only show a few messages after it

There is this moronic idiotic bug that will just choose any comment at random and start spamming me with the 'spam removed' message. Makes the app literally completly unusable can't even keep the window open because the pop up keeps coming up and ever time this bug happens it risks deleting my account.

The only way around it is to go to the posters profile, search for that video, and read it from there. PITA. Also don't care for all the suggested content. I never see any content from the accounts I actually follow. It's just continuous suggested content and ads, one after the other.

If you click on a video it takes you to reels and puts the sound on, so you're constantly having to jump to turn your sound off when around people. Then you have to press back to get out of reels mode. For someone who uses this app as it was originally intended, as a photo album with social media attached, it is not for for purpose."

Whenever I save a draft and I go back to edit the aspect ratio and positioning changes from what I selected, and it doesn't allow me to change it back.

It keeps spamming me with all the notifications I've gotten for the day on an hourly basis. So it just rapid fires notifications I've already seen, over and over. It'll freeze on me when I'm trying to post stories too and there are times where it will ONLY show suggested content and nothing else. No amount of phone restarting, un/reinstall seems to fix it, and the app is up to date. Its trash now."

I'll have to use a different app for my content creation now. And of course there's no way to get a hold of them. They better fix this soon"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Endless ads, getting worse every week. In different accounts I manage you folks keep moving the options to share to story, threads and reels, and it's infuriating. Most recently, SD card files (images and videos) are not properly showing up when looking to upload photos or videos, in any format. Only internal memory and older files are showing with some random cutoff date. This is a major bug that needs to be fixed and we need options to ""see all"" and ""see SD"" folders, too!"

These issues affect usability."

Constant glitches and features disappear and reappear from one minute to the next. Not user-friendly at all, especially when creating reels. For example, SOMETIMES (not always) there's an option to crop a cover image for the square grid view but even after cropping it reverts back after posting. Also adding sounds and multiple texts to reels is glitchy and frustrating."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has many faults and bugs but I can give the lowest rate even only because of this one: when you have a story consisting of a few slides with sound or added songs, then most of the time when you play the story, at some points of some slides your playback is going to be stopped, looking as if the slide(s) needed to load. The only thing you can actually do then is to skip the faulty slide, which is going to stay faulty usually even if you reattempt playing the story many times."

How have they not figured out a better way for us to edit our content within the app?? One of the biggest companies in the world yet they have terrible UX which should be their entire focus."

Now, it won't let me see older posts of people I follow when I click on that option. It's responsive only 2/3 of the time. I don't know what's happening and it needs to be fixed."

There is no tutorial or indication on how or if it's even possible to keep the app from restarting at the top every time you tab out. Also you can't upload from PC?

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is constantly limiting, blocking, deleting, closing and sensoring accounts especially business ones for reasons unknown. Nothing works against their ""community guidelines"" for certain pages. But a business page like mine reacts to a post and calls it hilarious and gets banned for commenting for 30 days. Created an account for a new Business.. put the logo up.. and 2 pics of hair products account banned. This is getting out of hand."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great HOWEVER! it would be better when a friend sends you multiple reels and you can just scroll down to the other one rather than watching and going back to the chat to open another one
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not well optimised for pixels. Although my pixel 6a device allows 3rd party apps to use all the camera sensors and night mode, Instagram doesn't make use of it, still takes the screenshots instead of actually clicking the pictures. There is also a bug that needs to be fixed. If there is a post with multiple pics or videos in it, when we open it the first photo or video goes black. Unless we swipe to the second and come back to the first, the first one will not be visible."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Irritating features that stop you from watching loops that do not seem to have any settings to disable.

In fact, this deserves 6 stars. The reason for that is he variety of content creators and videos you can scroll through. This is actually so fun when you are kind of bored and nothing to dedicate your time to. Overall, amazing app"

Also, a lot of transphobic content that I wouldn't like to see. Wish I could see more of my friend's content and less pages and ads. I deleted cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app (therefore signing in again) and no change. I really hope you get it together and fix this stuff soon, this is embarrassing for a major app"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very difficult to use, and lacks explanation for basic functions. Doesn't have a way to upload things from a laptop, which could have solved some of these counter-intuitive features that are on the app. Also way too many filtered photos that aren't marked as such, contributing to body image issues. Not to mention a bunch of ads for useless counterfeit products from China. Edit: Latest update makes it impossible to see older posts"

Recently Instagram deactivated my account that I'd had for over a decade now due to posting a screenshot from Baldurs Gate 3 that had nudity in it. After reaching out multiple times to different support pathways, no solution was found to recover my account, so I made a new one. Now this app is treating my new account as if it were a spam/botted account. Meta sucks, they don't know how to manage programming, their algos are programmed by toddlers."

My account has been terminated several times over posting completely normal comments, and the same is true for everybody I have asked.

Anyone that gets falsely flagged for spam will be targeted forever."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My comments already got removed 3/4 times for sharing a positive/non-harming comments in some reels...

If I ask to try 'retrieve the password' it proceeds to tell me there's no account with that email üòë now I can't create an account and there's no way to contact Instagram about it either.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it is painfully obvious that instagram doesnt care about its users anymore. small artists like myself have no way of getting reach because of the removal of the 'recent' feature in hashtags and thats not even it. the app is buggy and turning into a tiktok clone. eveer since the notes update my account wont update no matter how many time i uninstall or log out. if this doesnt get better soon im sorry but i have no choice but to put my time and energy into an app that actually respects it.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You cannot move a reel forward/backward anymore without it getting stuck. The time slider at the bottom of the reels is missing most of the time. Reels just don't work anymore. üëé

I didn't break any of the rules I keep seeing online about too much engagement or hash tags or spam. I was barely active that day. And support isn't supportive at all.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Been having issues with this app for almost 2 weeks now. It will not let you post recent photos that are saved in your external storage or even in internal storage. I've tried every method to reset the app thinking it was an issue on my end. I've logged in & out and used different accounts; I've also uninstalled & restarted the device multiple times & issue wasn't fixed. I logged in on my web browser on my account and tried posting from there and it works but the app doesn't. Frustrating!!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App feels to be broken after last updates. Clicking on comments button while watching reels doesn't open them, one have to click somewhere between like and comment to open comments. But it may also lead app to hang at the same time. An app should be tested before releasing an update."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why can't I upload videos anymore unless they're under a minute or recorded with the in-app camera? Bad design, totally arbitrary, needlessly frustrating. As a musician who just records videos on my phone, wishing to record multiple takes and post the best one later, Instagram is becoming increasingly useless to me. Edit: I tried the in-app camera to record a song and for some reason you have to hold down the record button, so that obviously doesn't work. This app is living in the stone age."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Such a pain to upload a post and not have your pics get cropped into oblivion especially if it's a post with more than one picture. Customer support is non existent. The algorithm now favors shitposting and girls in skimpy outfits. I no longer find smaller posts of new artists that used to make instagram special. It all feels monetary and no one sees your posts any more unless you pay to boost it.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app to use. There are plenty of filters and options on how you want to display yourself and create videos. I gave it 4 stars bcuz 1 MAJOR downfall and nuisance are the number of fake accounts and / or fake requests you get constantly. It's SUPER ANNOYING.

There needs to be a backup or just save it if it doesn't upload the first time and/or have an option to physically try again.

Now they're targeting me and my account, limiting views, altering comments, not allowing me to use the app normally. Cyber assault IMO"

I was watching reels, and it was just fine, then all of a sudden I can't see comments on any of it. So I closed it out and did all the steps, and now reels won't work. I'm able to click on one, but can't scroll down, it's just black and stuck on loading."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have very bad and also good experience because at first I liked the app but later my account got hacked. You should improve the security of this app so that this happened to me today so that it doesn't happen to anyone else. So I uninstalled this app. Apart from that, the app is good, only a little bit of security needs to be increased."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow, this new update is so bad it forces you to watch a reel from start to finish. Not letting you to choose which portion you want to watch or replay. It literally freezes the entire video."

Losing all my personal photos and was never even given a reason. Yet people are scamming and they still have accounts I'm an actual user whom used it as Intended and I get my account deactivated for no reason and no email from them at all.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I should not have updated my app because this version is actually a downgrade. 1. When I am typing a commet, it would show it in a straight line, so I have to drag the consur all the way back to check for grammatical errors. 2. I used to delete/archive a particular slide in an uploaded post with the previous versions. Now, that feature is gone. I would have to delete/archive the entire post now.

The app is up to date, I've cleared the cache and all the other thing the internet tells you to do and I'm still not able to post reels on any of my accounts!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They recently changed the comments on reels: before, it would go from most to least liked so the first ones you'd see would have lots of likes and comments and were more entertaining. Now, it's from most to least recent so you don't really see any funny comments anymore, most of the comments I see are just heart emojis and things like that. It makes the app less fun and I feel less connected with others. Also, there are lots of glitches, which others seem to have noticed too."

The app auto refreshes when I'm in the middle of watching a reel or creating a post. I can't see what I'm replying to comments because it appears in a continuous line that I can't scroll through."

This is fine for when I'm just wanting to post a single photo, but I can not share multiple photos to one post this way, so I'm stuck sharing camera pics one at time, one pic per post.

I have tried force stopping it and reinstalling but it keeps doing this really weird thing where the photo/post is fine until I get to the caption page and then it just randomly flips the image upsidedown for no apparent reason.

Same with picture reels. They are not the same quality as just a regular post! Also randomly zooms in your photos just a lil bit, throwing all good angles off completely! It's not fair because you don't get what you posted. You get a slightly lesser quality, zoomed in picture that's now a different angle than what you posted!"

I feel like I keep having to update my 1 star reviews to new 1 star reviews because different things keep happening than leave the app unusable to me.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The new update is complete trash. Why take away the ability to share posts on your story? You are ruining people's chances at gaining popularity faster. Ever since you started updating it with useless things like only promoting reels and constantly moving around the buttons I've had less and less respect for this app and company as a whole.

I cleared the catche on my phone, then deleted and reinstalled the app, but it's still not fixed. Idk why it's doing this but it's really annoying."

Uhhh! I want to finish looking exactly where I was! How about it not even recognizing you ALREADY have it installed and opening Google Play instead of the app to open links? Yes, and now it also CENSORS any comment critical of products in ads that show in your feed! That's ok. I'll never interact with ANY add anymore, just block them."

Instagram is a popular social media platform where users share photos, videos, and stories with their followers.

Users can also interact with posts by liking, commenting, and sharing them. Overall, it's a platform that fosters creativity,"

Sometimes audio from a recording I discard lingers and stays. Only time it goes away is if I close out the app completely. That's a pain when I'm trying to record a moment on the fly and the app has to be rebooted completely to record. The app needs a facelift. Lowered the score to 3 stars for now.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly your app sucks for Android. You send out updates in God knows what random phases. You cannot improve and stick to a good UI. You cannot fix your bugs when creating reels. I stopped making content because of the ridiculous bugs, for example, zooming in a video clip unnecessarily, taking time to load stories. You could do a LOT. Or just don't. Go back to being basic if you can't handle extra."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently, I have noticed a discrepancy in the time spent data displayed on the app. Even when I use Instagram for a short period (in minutes), the app reflects a significantly higher time spent in hours. Conversely, on days when I haven't used the app at all, it still shows a substantial amount of time spent. This inconsistency is concerning, as it does not accurately reflect my actual usage patterns. I rely on the time spent feature to monitor and manage my social media activity."

The editor for reels always crashes and also saves tons of edited videos on my phone even after posted or deleted, so my Instagram winds up with a storage of up to 10gb. For phones with less storage that's impossible. It has a lot of problems even if you don't consider the algorithm completely not caring about small creators."

Also, sometimes I open certain chats, and for whatever reason, it refuses to mark them as read. Sometimes, messages vanish as well. Brilliant app, but these small things just hinder the experience."

On the home page, I can't see what my friends post for more than 3 posts, then it turns into ""suggested"" accounts to follow. Same thing with stories, making them all accounts I do not follow. What is the point of having a home page? Finding new accounts should only be on the explore page. DMs always glitch.

Oh, and my alt account that used to be linked to my main account is lost to me, unless I decide to find a way to bypass 2FA. Besides all these issues though, Instagram is very solid."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,is relatively easy and you can promote your business making campaigns on Instagram stories. The algorithm always looks for a target audience that is interested on what you are selling and this is something that people can take advantage of. Cons: There are many fake businesses and scammers that appear every day on Instagram stories trying to make honest people lose their money. I think that Instagram has to pay more attention on what is being promoted as a service or product. Rachael Ok Hii

But I have to watch the video repeatedly to note them down. A simple pause/ play is needed for a video platform such as Instagram.

The feed is broken, I no longer get suggested content, I rarely ever get more than three posts before having to refresh to see old posts.

I would love to see more being done to even eliminate bot and scam accounts, as they can be even dangerous for any user.

I can‚Äôt understand how a world-famous company, having such resources and spending so much time developing a product, can create such an incomprehensible interface.

More and more of the interface keeps being taken up by content that is not posted by people I chose to follow, so it is barely meeting its basic purpose at this point. Also maybe stop shoving ""reels"" down everyone's throats while converting stories to reels *still* doesn't work.

They'll delete your comments when they're not even a violation of their guidelines, but then they'll leave comments of people saying horrendous things.

The uploading of videos is itself not great, I have to crop videos to 5:4 ratio for them to upload without Instagram completely ruining the videos, zooming in on them, or having a mind of their own. Apart from that it's grand."

Then, I can't skip the reels to certain duration."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Changing my review to 1 star because whenever I use a wireless headphones and make a video call. It automatically turns the speaker output instead of the Bluetooth wireless headphones. Totally pissing off experience.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New update is horrible, I can't answer a video call unless I call, and the app refuses to end a call. When I attempt to answer the call all I get is a black screen. When I try to start the call again to contact the same person i receive the notification that I'm already in a call (even if it has been marked as missed) and the app won't ""end"" the call no matter how many times I select the end call button on the notification. Sharing reels also doesn't work during calls."

For the 2nd time, i told in a comment to like my comment but again the security locked my account and some of my content are also removedüò°. See, it's ok to have security but not that much that ruins the app. Otherwise it is a 5 star app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently, I have noticed a discrepancy in the time spent data displayed on the app. Even when I use Instagram for a short period, the app reflects a significantly higher time spent in hours. Conversely, on days when I haven't used the app at all, it still shows a substantial amount of time spent. This inconsistency is concerning, as it does not accurately reflect my actual usage patterns. I rely on the time spent feature to monitor and manage my social media activity."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recently, I've experienced an issue with posting stories. Instagram used to be worthwhile and great to post on until it started messing up in the Stories department. Between either not posting stories or warping the stories that ARE posted, I don't see the reason in doing anything with Instagram any longer. I'm disappointed because several of my posts have been messed up and then for some reason, when you crop and post stuff on Instagram, it'll crop it in the gallery. Not worth downloading."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why does reels no longer can be forward??? The forward bar disappeared when I try to forward the video and the video crash. FIX THIS ASAP. DON'T CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BROKEN
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop changing ui. Why you doing this? If you want to change just change colors and some stuff. Dont change the logic. In the previous version, it silenced the reel when clicked, now it stops it when we click it. And you also placed the mute button in the lower left corner. You are testing things on us as if we were your test users. Now stop changing a few fixed things and focus on its stable operation."

E.g. hand and face movement options do not exist as displayed on their help page. 2.) The censoring is horrible. 3.) It freezes a lot, whether you are watching content or trying to post.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has always been the only social media app I use religiously, but now that a lot of key functions don't work anymore, I have no use for it. Posting on your stories takes various tries before it finally uploads what you want it to and doesn't give you an error message, and sometimes it doesn't matter how many times you try, it will keep giving you Error and make it impossible to post what you want. Just this is enough to push a faithful user away... it's been going on for months."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has made big improvements since my last post here. It runs more smoothly. I hold out on the 5th star because the special effects on the reels sometimes cause glitches. I notice when I do not use IG's reel effects, my reels run much smoother. Great upgrades though.

The drafts feature doesn't work, it either glitches when you go to save it as a draft or errors out when you post the draft.

I also hate the ""auto-refresh"" thing it does occasionally. In the middle of reading comments, it'll refresh and the post is gone forever if I didn't give it a like."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram has gone crazy right now.....I have no idea what the hell happened but the reels have gone out of whack.....my algorithm was daily BTS reels and contents but out of nowhere it suddenly started showing me of things from India which I have absolutely no interest in. Fix this and give my BTS reels back.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram one of the best social media app in which you can share your own post and the most beautiful thing about this app is the reels I love watching this reels and the problem is that there is no stop option after playing the video though it is very bad for me all social media app has this option so who am I to say instagram that it should be brought very soon app
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Easily it can be hacked.... I trusted so much and had so many pics and videos but this app is very much unsecured and easily got hacked without asking for any code or anything. Worst security measures
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is trash. It has ruined friendships and relationships. It pulls me away from enjoying my passions, or from accomplishing work. It makes me sadn anxious, and causes panic and dissassociation. I miss when the world wasn't controlled by algorithm. Update - the app continues to collapse into ruin. We thought we could fight it off, and many died in the blasts... but Metas soldiers kept pushing... slaughtering.... it was the most horrific thing I'd ever witnessed. Update in 2024: Still trash"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram comments are rude! Lots of things that need to be banned don't get banned and it's so easy to hack an account i just got hacked for the 3rd time and I had all protection on seriously do better also your Instagram account center dose not help i put the in information in and it sends me back to the homepage!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Some Instagram stories in my archive are unavailable. The problem seems to be on Instagram's end since I updated the app multiple times and nothing changed.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The initial opening of the app when it shows your feed, you start reading a post and it scrolls because it has loaded more new posts so you have to scroll down quite a bit to find the post you were reading, incredibly annoying. Also, the lag when pressing to pause a reel is very bad, when you press to pause a reel on iPhone it stops instantly, why doesn't it do that on Android?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Dear Instagram, I love to use Instagram. But few days i am not able to refresh the feed .

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram has been the messiest app I've ever seen. I mean it makes it EXTREMELY hard to log in or sign up to any of your accounts. Plus it keeps telling you that something went wrong but they really don't even know what went wrong and leaves you frustrated like that and you they are not even trying to actually corporate and solve your problem. Like do not choose it as a means of communication or entrainment IT WILL GET MESSY. Edit: still trying to recover my accounts. One of the worst things.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram is blocking me from following other accounts or liking or commenting in posts with no reason . Is it not allowed in instagram following popular pages ??!! I just followed multiple popular pages and instagram blocked me from all features. This is nonsense . I didn't face that in other apps.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"they only focus on features to make them more money. These features help ruin your experience on the app. the app automatically updates your entire feed and you can't find old posts. Reels and posts automatically move to new ones if you watch one twice without you scrolling. and I constantly have fake notifications that won't go away (been this way for multiple years). every 3rd post is an ad or ""suggested"" post by Instagram. it's turning into a horrible app and being horrible for society."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A very unstable 3 stars. The app was good. UI aside, my problem is that I can't clear cache memory by any means. Story bugs, posting bugs and ""older posts"" are just annoying but the fact that I can't clear cache is detrimental and should be fixed. And why aren't the photos from my memory card visible when other apps ""see"" them? One less star as of right now cause I can't post a photo unles it's a screenshot of a photo strored on a memory card."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nice job putting the volume to the upper side of the phone. I can't reach it with one hand. I don't want it to scroll to the next reel. F annoying. And please I don't want the floating comment on reels. Already can't see half of the video because you try to be tiktok but with the comment I can see there's even less space. Lot of video with subtitles. Where should they put it? The middle of the video?!? Don't scroll automatically to the next reel!!!@!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is good in this app But could u plz bring an update in which we could ahe an option "" Do not recommend videos from this is "" similar to that we are having on YouTube This would help us to avoid certain id who creates an irritating videos or those id on which the content is not appropriate So plz if it is possible try to introduce this in the next update"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's annoying that we can't pause the video. I see some videos where they list name of few books. But I have to watch the video repeatedly to note them down. A simple pause/ play is needed for a video platform such as Instagram. Hire some people from Youtube to learn how to implement pause and play. As your product managers to think ...
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram goes through your personal chats, so you can't have a normal conversation with your friend without being monetized. They love to restrict little accounts but refuse to do anything about the scam or onlyfans accounts. So I wouldn't download this app unless you want them snooping through your personal conversation. @Instagram you have downgraded big time, don't go through peoples personal messages that's how you catch a case"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is broken and I'm losing interest very fast, you don't have customer support unless you pay for verification, I can't hit the like button at all or follow accounts so whats the point of logging on Instagram if I can't see or like anything????"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Frustrating frequent interface changes disrupting familiarity rather not enhancing user experience. The feed often loads improperly. Suggestions appear repetitive. No music access. What even worse is, message notifications appear after being and replied. And more importantly, response to reported content is often delayed and is not even looked into, mentioning short of resources due to the high volume of reports. Overall, frustrating and irritating updates without much focus on user experience."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since December 19th update on my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra can use app for like 30 minutes then instantly stops working (crashes,spinning wheel, blurred pictures but you'll have adds that perfectly work fine!) Get out of app without logging out check u-tube,tubi ,nfl mobile and they all stream perfect all on a good 5g to 5g ultra capacity! I mean it's every frigging 30 to 40 minutes and it's like it wants to cut me off of using the app and I'm not posting pictures or videos while on it!"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no mute button to mute the volume. Now it just pauses the video. Stop changing the UI by removing features please.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's so disappointing that after the latest update there's another bug which this time disables the app the access to the photos and videos stored on the SD card. I cannot post basically anything. And as an admin of various websites I'm not going to copy everything onto the phone's inner memory just to post it! Meta, have mercy and do your job properly"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Five stars updated to two. How are you going to get me addicted to reels, the best part of the app, and then have so many glitches it makes the app unusable. Is this your way of saying I need less screen time?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app keeps getting worse. Not only can I not see reels and skip at certain points, but my feed couldn't be refreshed now. Is anyone having he same problem? I checked my wifi, but it's okay."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scheduling reels doesn't work. The app abysmal. Very buggy if you want to post stuff. Hugely limits your reach and is stress inducing. Not to mention pushing Threads like I want another buggy app with no reach to drive me mad. If you are a content creator with life, I'd look alsewhere."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's one of best applications I have ever used. Its features are really outstanding and easy to upload the pictures. Furthermore, it doesn't have any adds like YouTube and other applications do. I prefer Instagram the best. I highly recommend this to those who are quite interested in photography and want post their long lasting memories. It must be rated with five stars üåü, I think."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm unsure why instagram is STILL so buggy. I set it up for my posts not to save to my gallery and yet they keep saving to my gallery anyway. When I'm watching reels, the same reel will appear twice in a row, and if I reply to a comment through my notifications, it acts as though I didn't reply at all. Whoever's in charge of maintenance, CONTINUES to do a horrible job üëçüèæ"

I would give the rating 4 stars if this wasn't a problem, but not being able to upload or share photos on a social media app kinda defeats the whole purpose"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Instagram doesn't give me features for my main account which is public but giving a lot good features to my private account which is just a side account or my personal Account I want the features of the latest installation in my public and main account which I have tried my best to add but it is not coming like putting songs on stories and notes and fitting the reel on the screen of story the app doesn't provide features to my main account which is important I'm hating it now
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Trash app that fails to work anymore. Can't post recents or pretty much anything taken from my SD card. App can now only post screenshots and random things stored locally on my phone. This has happened for a bit over a week now and I don't recommend because app it no longer works even across accounts and even after uninstalling and logging out and logging back in. Another problem I've been having is that messages don't appear for DAYS. TRY ANY OTHER APP BECAUSE THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.

I have to close it and reopen it to get it to stop but it starts all over again if I try and do any of the things mentioned before
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"These are my main issues with the app 1. My Instagram app isn't showing the schedule posts option on one of my account yet it's shown on the other account. 2. The app doesn't open up in full screen, it's literally the only app on my phone that isn't opening up in full screen. I've tried all solutions to these problems but I can't seem to find any so my only hope is that Instagram will try & fix these. Aside from those everything else seems to be working fine."

All of a sudden experiencing the following; - Can't leave comments on ""popular"" / verified accounts, they literally erase after posting, even though they are encouraging or positive. - Many of my earlier reels have no sound suddenly yet were important snapshots of memories now lost. - Can't post my own stories, they erase, can only share reels/posts others. When they do finally upload are blurry and pixelated. - Can't edit text to fix typos - lots of bugging"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is getting worse by the day. It idiotically removes comment, infact the ones that are very simple honest and having no bad language.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram suspended my account for being me. They said I was using a fake account, but it matches my driver's license and my passport. This App. just blatantly LIED !! You would think as much negative and inhumane situations that take place every day on the internet that Instagram would have a better security than to suspend somebody's account that made the account, that used the picture that is associated with his ID'S . Forget Your App. ""LIARS"""
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Truly an awfully made app. Constantly breaking. If you like posting things it can be an unfixable nightmare. Maybe you can't select any pictures from albums. Maybe editing a picture breaks everything. Reinstalling doesn't help, just stops you from logging in because the extra security steps are so over the top. No email verification? Really? Use another device, nope, my OLD phone number, nope, or a code they gave me years ago...no. This app is only good for scrolling."

Went to try Threads, I got a pop-up that said I couldn't comment for 3 day until I proved my identity. A day later, I got the 'Account been compromised ' popup and had to change my password.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Awful. I've reported issues 4 times and never received any feedback or response and issues still aren't fixed. Everytime I watch reels my instagram malfunctions and won't let me tap the screen or read comments or like anything unless I close the app and re open it. When I scroll to a different reel the comment pages from the previous reel appears for the one below it or anything else I watch. I can't update any stories to my highlights because they refuse to upload into my archive. Awful app

Despite multiple attempts, I am unable to block the account. This issue is concerning to me as it pertains to my personal security and privacy on the platform. I have tried troubleshooting steps such as logging out and back in, clearing the app cache, and updating the app to the latest version, but the problem persists."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but these updates seem like they're doing more bad than good. I hate how it just refreshes the feed on its own, even if you didn't exit the app. I don't know what y'all did, but I hate how it looks when you're leaving a comment. This straight line thing isn't working for me. Please bring back paragraphs."

Instead of suggesting the individual convos, it suggests random groups we made a while back that nobody uses anymore. What's worst is that it doesn't let me send my post to some individuals. Please fix, it led to very awkward interactions."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a pity what happened to algorithms after 2021, because small creators and artists just don't have a platform, as Instagram doesn't give them enough reach and engagement even with their own followers!

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last year has been nothing but trash from Instagram. Terrible feed design that forces you into reels at every opportunity makes me close the app out of frustration constantly.

I don't like opening the app and finding a message from a random stranger asking me to click a link or send them money which I find and it always turns out to be a scam and can lead to a bug in the system."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate updating this app... because the updates BREAK the app. I hadn't updated since April 2021. It's been over a year and half. The app was working perfectly this entire time. The recent addition of longer story tabs was helpful to me so I updated it. Worse decision... Now my app is constantly having trouble loading content - either comments, profiles, or posts. It just keeps loading or it will say it couldn't load. I am ANNOYED. For context: I have an iPhone as well and it works fine there."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor customer support, difficulty getting through via Instagram customer service email or phone number. Unexplainable account deactivation or block. Nudity on the platform. Scammers and fraudulent activities by other users. Challenges with Instagram login. Content with minors that never seem to get banned."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The filtering system is absolute trash. Everything seems to be labeled as spam and has been removed. I just commented and said ""sounds like something someone from Austin would say"" and it got removed and I got a warning saying if I do it again my account will be deleted."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPDATE: So here's the thing. Instagram has been giving me wrongful removals all over my second page, and I'm getting tired of it. The amount of times I've been dinged for having ""misleading comments, or trying to get likes and support from others"" I DO NOT DO THIS FOR ME. I am just a person trying to support other artists who deserve it. Instagram has been backlashing me for about a week now. I'm reporting this issue asap because this is getting ridiculous and uncalled for."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Again this particular app is doing the same when I was commenting on a video saying I'm spam I'm repeating the same content to get likes and etc. What the hell is that. I should even say what I think. I didn't use any offensive language either. The freedom of speech is going in instagram.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I doubt anyone even reads these reviews- but I would just like to say, Instagram has been pretty buggy lately. Instagram will remove some of the most random comments I make, claiming it goes against their guidelines or something. Then, Instagram completely bugs out and I can't even open the app for awhile, because whenever I do, the screen saying my comment was removed will pop up. I've done nothing wrong and I think it's unfair that my comments are being removed for no apparent reason."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great to stay in touch with people and talk to everyone as well as share your creative endeavors but it regularly changes its format which can sometimes making it confusing as to where to find certain selections and there are way too many spam accounts and porn bots that start following you or request to follow you, that's the annoying part but, other than that, it's a good app."

I still get posts from accounts I'm subscribed to and can message people, so I don't think I've been banned, and even so, I don't know what I'd be banned for, I've never been controversial. I'm just so confused. All in all 2 stars"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for many years and I have to say this is the worst the app has ever been. Especially the notifications, it's horrible not being able to see anything past an hour. If I want to respond to comments I have to search through my own profile to find which pic was commented on. A lot of the features are unreliable, it's so hard to post sometimes, and the tl is trash I never see any of my moots!! At this point I'd recommend any other social media app besides this one."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The stories keep saying error when I try to post my stories. The app allows all types of spam accounts to attack you without fixing the issue, and when I block someone, I keep getting a message that says that I cannot block them. The app literally unblocks who I tried to block. This whole platform needs work and better ways to protect its consumers. I would give this no stars if I could. What happened to Instagram???"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Made a brand new account to get a fresh start on social media. BUT! I dont have the features i used to have... like adding music to my profile or adding music to my note! And my insta is up to date.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So. It's okay. But there's some kind of memory leaking problem I think related to drafts. Every few days I need to delete all data and cache because instagram slowly takes up more and more storage. Like 100gb + with no drafts, no photos, or anything being saved on instagram. Not sure what's up with the editing and posting, but it's not exactly polished. Eg The closed captions for reels or stories nearly never work. Also uploading reels only sometimes works."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Reels just started auto playing next and there doesn't seem to be an option to turn this off. Super irritating. And I hate the auto refresh on my feed. Sometimes you need to switch apps or turn off your screen momentarily, but if you do that, the feed is just refreshed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The notifications is extremely buggy I keep receiving the same messages and notifications that I already read since weeks ago. And they still give me that same notification all day. And it keeps ringing all night. I couldn't go to sleep because of that. They need to fix the algorithm more often I want to recommend anyone downloading this app because this app is extremely gives you anxieties.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps changing without notice. Would be nice that when you change parts of how your users interact with your app that they are notified of the changes made and how to use them. I also see an increase in bugs. I have about 10 posts which I get an error for and won't upload. I actually sent an email to your support but not a single reply after 4 days of waiting. Which is why I am writing this review. If you are not using Instagram don't start, they don't support you and they break the app."

When posting to my story I used to be able to browse and select a folder, now there's an undefined default that I can't adjust, and the default is missing a lot of my pictures.

I had experienced it, and this makes me anxious to try again and again for almost 10 times to check what was happened. Later, there was a message which say that search more or something related to this. Although I am not satisfied with this, as I am a anxious person, but the security centre of meta has ensured me that nothing is wrong with my ig account. You know I am confident about your app."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was alright when I first got the app but it's ridiculous how often harmless comments can get taken down and reported while actual hateful comments stay up. All the new changes being made to the app are annoying too, such as the new feature where if you tap a reel it just pauses instead of the audio turning off or on when you want it too. I'm also not a fan of the share bar being changed around. I share stuff to my story a lot and it's a pain when I go to click share to story and it's threads"

The search option when pressed gives you an unwanted full screen of distracting suggested public posts of photos & videos & send you down a hole of wasted time. Also, the Reels tab is annoying that it's a readily available tab, another attention grabbing rabbit hole for wasting time on tik tok style videos..

At first I thought it was just my phone since it's living of a prayer I've had it for 2 years. Yet my other apps don't do this. After reading other reviews it's the app itself. I'm not on much but when I do get on I want it to be simple. Edit to add 6 months later still doing the same thing
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,An amazing tool for promoting content. It is becoming older generation user friendly.

I don't share my face on Facebook unless it's with a select few people. I had no idea that the posts were now linked, & my privacy was violated. I am highly disappointed in you, Instagram. Ask your users before you activate a privacy feature like that to be public. I'm highly disappointed and angry. Considering deleting all accounts from both platforms."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Auto scroll is ruining my experience. I love how someone Instagram thought it was a great idea to implement an auto scroll feature before you can turn it off in settings. Sometimes it tries to scroll BEFORE A REEL IS OVER. Good to know Instagram is greedy and is probably just trying to make people consume more ads.

Whenever I try to scroll on one of those picture posts it won't let me it just glitches the ""try again later"" with an additional text that says ""we restrict certain activity to protect our community"" button multiple times and it won't let me click it. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the cache but none of that worked I don't know what's going on and how to fix this but its starting to annoy me."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I wish Instagram would go back to prioritizing photos over videos. I use it for business, and I used to get so many more views.

Even then, the stories and videos are cropped too small to see all the text and the messages often won't show up as read even after you open them/ click on the videos. Clearly not much thought has gone into app design for this phone. Can't make posts, stories are annoying to use. Nothing works the way it would on any smart phone. Booooo Meta sucks"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Honestly I rather mute the video by just tapping on it....and not pausing it by tapping it.... I'll just hold the video to pause it or re watch it by letting it repeat it self.

I also think it would be a great idea for there to be an option of disabling reels. too many ads. - I am begging you to please make an option to disable reels.

Kinda hard to use the app when I can't upload anything haha pls help"

When I post a reel, it doesn't let me post and exits me out and I have to do it again, Instagram stories are glitchy and it still shows I have a story even after 24 hours. False strikes as well."

My 2nd account does get notifications for everything, but it keeps loading suggested posts over new ones from my follows. First post on feed reloads like 3 different ones so if you're trying to view, it replaces it with another like 3 times. 1st acct can't pause reels by tap, but 2nd one can only hold to pause and tap mutes. So many bugs for one of the biggest apps in the world."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a really good app but it has a lot of glitches. And I don't know why but Instagram has temporarily banned me from liking any reel,following anyone etc.Because they thought that I shared my password with a service for likes and followers but I didn't. I only removed some of my followers cause I didn't know them and unfollowed a lot of people because my feed was boring and I am following more than 4000 people so I just wanted to remove unwanted following . Please look into the issue."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app does not allow Google Photos to share multiple photos to create a multiple photo post, which can be quite frustrating given the far superior search features within the Google Photos app compared to the Instagram UI. Seems like a quick win for the developers considering they already support this sharing for 'Stories' and 'Reels', just not the main form of posts."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's acctually so good. it's really late, and a notification just popped up asking me if I'd like to close Instagram for the night or keep scrolling. I think it's really thoughtful. it's also a really good platform overall."

I can post ( I like the upload thanks.) and it gets my account restricted and the comment is removed with a threatening series of violation warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è. This App was really fun and enjoyable about 10 months ago. Now it is saturated with politics and that wrecks the experience for me. I come to Instagram to get away from toxic politics.

The save feature on chats hasn't even worked for months. Not only that, it's so sad that for an app that is entirely picture based how badly any image gets compressed and ruined and that's not even considering the video compression. Year later same thing. App constantly broken videos inside DMs haven't been loading for months"

Now the comments are one long line (on mobile devices) whereas before the user could see all the text and proofread it before sending it. Please make the UI more user friendly. Also I'm wondering what drives the pictures that come up in the search window? I get many that I have no nothing to do with the search. I see the comments for ads are suppressed. Why is that? Retailers don't like feedback?? The auto update is so annoying. Users should be able to disable it.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app has way too many bugs. I'm a small business and I check my messages all day long then randomly get a messages dated from 5 days ago. This isn't good for business and needs to be fixed. I've even had the chat opened and refreshed waiting on a customer to reply only to have it come in like an hour later dated a few days ago. It also crashed the app when I try to delete comments. Do better! And get rid of the stupid thread bs or at least an option to not have to see them in my feed.

Another thing is that I can't add links or to my highlights anymore. This needs to get fixed. It seems the app got more bugs with the update and fixed nothing. I've reported the problems multiple times and it still does not get fixed. It used to not be like this. The quality sure went down.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app feels like it only gets worse. The algorithm pushes toxic and hateful/negative content in reels, even after clicking ""not interested"" repeatedly. I wish instead of useless features Instagram would finally add customizable feeds, like twitter's circles or pinterest's board suggestions. It would make it so much more fun to use and feel more tailored to your mood and interests while still pushing relevant new content. Especially with ""Saves/Collections"" already being there!"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram works amazingly usually. Crashes randomly but not that often. Just got rid of moving to next reel feature. Instagram used to have a feature where if the same reel plays 3 times it will automatically move to the next one. I loved that. Also reels are freezing. All this is with the newest update.

But Everytime someone calls through your messenger it freezes up an forces me to go through the app settings to re-establish that I have permission turned off for calls, mic, and pics. But it forces me to do it every time multiple times someone spams my account with calls. It b nice if u could stop them after the 3rd call n under a minute. But I'm thinking ur app isn't worth the hassle if it keeps up another day of spam calls."

Messages not appearing in chats even if I tap on a notification for that message. Sometimes this lasts for days. Sorry IG but your new hashtag ""filter"" is awful. AWFUL.

If you think sticking this junk in my Instagram feed to promote Threads (which I actually LIKE as an app!) is a good idea, then think again. It's making me not want to engage with either platform. Give users choice. Such a simple and effective strategy."

The contradictory clauses made by these entities are criminal and violates section 203. My account was disabled, because someone lied and claimed I wasn't real. Instagram doesn't give me an option as indicated in the help center. I follow the steps and mine are incomplete there fore making it difficult to communicate with anyone. No one is above law."

A bad experience to be using Instagram even using latest smartphone."

Wouldn't let me use the account until I do, stating it's to improve experience and easier confirmation or whatnot.

Biggest issue right now is the fact that when I follow someone new , they reject my following with a pending notice (despite being public account )"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been around for years and it's still one of the worst functioning apps. Open the app and it immediately reloads for no reason? I think they do it on purpose so you spend even longer on their app trying to find whatever it is you just saw. The whole thing is just to mind-f*k you to look at more ads, get more riled up, and waste your life."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to give 5 star bt in case of my Instagram they didn't provided me some features which are updated 6 7 months ago if those features will available soon I'll be giving 5 star for sure (the features like notes, image download etc.) hope they'll make some change and update my Instagram properly"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely üí©! nothing but a wanna-be tiktok now. I've never had so many issues with this app over all the years I've used it. Can't even upload multiple photos without IG shrinking them, they don't boost anything other than reels (again, wanna-be tiktok). Someone needs to come out with a new app so I can delete IG after all"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst App ever created. Garbage. Made by morons. Anti-intuitive, full of bugs, laggy, slow loading, full of restrictions, a nightmare for those who need it for work, anti-business, not user friendly and more. Waste of time and money. This app should not be improved, but eradicated. Later edit: 1 year after and still disaster. Also still no web functionality improvement."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to upload my videos in landscape without the black background showing up, and it was only uploading the video. Now with this stupid new update my video format is all wrong and won't upload anything without adding giant black borders around my videos. This looks TERRIBLE and makes me look like I don't know how to format. I ONLY post reels on my account, and now they're awful, my followers are complaining to me and I have to keep telling them it's an instagram issue, FIX IT!!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With consistency, app crashes when you: 1) create a post from a few videos 2) add a filter to the video post 3) manually adjust the filter intensity up or down. It works for about 1 second and then either crashes the entire app, or brings you back to the ""new post"" page with no video selected"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is fine sometimes but has alot of problems. Currently wont let me open comments or like or shar videos. I can tap on them with a clean screen and all but it doesn't register. I cant make reels on the app anymore and have to upload them from a editing app. Audios will delete or freeze over and keep playing if i close the app or try to uplaod a new reel. Its annoying how bugs will get 'fixed' but then theres always new ones.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. but recently I can't reply to ANYONE'S stories! when I try to the keyboard pops up, but when I type it's nothing in the message box. I use to be able to reply to my friends stories. But now I can't reply to no one's story. I've tried multiple times and every time the keyboard pops up like normal. But when I text nothing shows up. üòí üòï NOW I can't see comments on people's lives that I follow. This is ridiculous!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes, my videos and pictures are upside-down, when I try to upload a video it deletes, and it freezes. Most of the times my videos are not even shown to my followers, which is very upsetting. I had an account that had more that 10k followers, but I lost it due to a phone change, IG was no help. I couldn't get my account back no matter what I did, so I had to start over."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"To share pictures, it's cool. As a community, it's trash. IG's algorithm is basically a harassment bot, and there's no feedback, so it will only get progressively more dense. The only safe comment is üî•üî•üî•"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ive been using this app for 4 years and it was the best app ever but ever since instagram has been getting new updates it started glitching. Every time i post new stuff on my account there are 6 blocks over my post thats different colours and its so annoying and when i view stories it'll be as normal and then the next story will be completely black so then i have to go out of the story and back in to view what they have posted. Instagram has downgraded tbh.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My messages are not sending even though i have strong internet connection. Everything is working fine i can send pictures in chat watch reels post pictures, stories the whole app is working properly. But text messages are not delivering. I have to put my phone on aeroplane mode again and again in order to send messages but still they takes a long time. I have updated the app reinstalled it also but still the issue is not resolving."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Troubles do come up with many video reels, and many avoid chatting with others, but it's a nice way to get a little motivational jolt or quick laugh."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many bugs are there in Instagram..i can't be published my videos..i can't save my videos too..i have reported many times but no response, it states that in my account status ""you're not able to monetize some of your tools""was in orange colour As I never used to violate any rules nor any community guidance, please restore my account to normalüôèi request to Instagram pleaseü•∫so that's why am giving one star.. Hope you understand my situation..it's been 1month i have faced this situation."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps giving errors and deleting stories after I spend a long time putting them together. Or I post it and it disappears, lost forever. Can't save the video beforehand as a precaution because then that gives an error and deletes it. Updated to the current version, still happens. Very annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am using Instagram since 3 years, and like after such a great span of time of using it, I was really happy having this app...but for some reason for any comment I post on any reels or post, like the most sweet ones to encourage others, I am getting freaking community guidelines and the content is getting removed off.....I can't understand what was the reason, like literally FOR GETTING FAKE LIKES AND FAME????? What kind of guidelines is this?????"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Deducting a star because of the video chat feature. I have no interest in seeing my own face on half of the screen. It should have been a smaller screen on the side or wherever.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Instagram account is not opening their is couldn't refresh the feed problem is coming. My internet is working on other apps but not on Instagram and Facebook. Plz, do something about that. This problem is coming from 9:27 pm."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Now a Days I am Not Able To watch The Reels, Its Keep on Loading and Showing an Error like "" No Internet Connection with Blank Screen"" , through i Had a Better Internet Connectivity. I Close and Reopen the App for the Next Time the Same Reels I'm able to see and I cant able to load the New Reels. And The Screen is Blinking.I uninstalled the app for Several Times But the issue is Same. Worst Experience Ever."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since a recent update, you can no longer browse reels with audio off unless your phone volume is turned off. Please switch back to allow people to scroll through reels without sound. As of now, you can only have sound off on reels if it is on your feed or on someone's profile, not in the reels tab."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is not showing my friends' recent posts on my feed, and my comments won't appear on my end but do on their end. I have to go to their account to see if they posted anything recent. I can only see that my comments were liked in notifications but don't appear on their post."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,For a creator it is insanely maddening to try and track all their changes to content limits and required specs. Trying to google the latest requirements leads to 40 article sites that are no doubt behind the latest change.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be good. Lately, I have been facing many performance issues viz unable to load followers/following list goes on in loop and repeats after only 10-15 users, the app doesn't load the conversation and comments sometimes irrespective of your internet connection üòë. The app can perform well if this feedback and others like these are taken into consideration and help it fix."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram deserves 0 Rattings every twice in a week glitches came out like fake notifications badges slow processing while scrolling, mixing of sound in reels, and slow refresh page makes it pathetic. Because of the arrival of ""Meta"" bugs ratio increases üò§ü§ï"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has just become worse and worse. The UI doesn't make sense between posts, stories, and reels. It has more and more censorship. My reach is slumping all the time while my followers are increasing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For the love of god they need to make an option to disable auto play on reels, especially on the For You page. Having 2 videos play at once+the other still posts is a visual nightmare. Also I have a message notification that won't go away even though I've checked all of my message feeds. This app gets worse with every update"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Darkmode barely functions. If I open an external link in a chat or even open someone's profile from a comments section, the darkmode feature will break, and the app will load dark text over a dark background, or light text on a light background. Typically if I open an external link, I have to close and reopen the app to resume using it because the darkmode crash renders the app unusable. Also your algorithm is AWFUL and the flood of reels suck, but you'll never fix those issues unfortunately."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Early March and early April updates suck. Not only you can not FFWD or RWND freely but with the latest update, the app allows you to use ONLY 5 hashtags for reels! The algorithm doesn't help small accounts so we were using hashtags to be more visible... Not anymore! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram is very glitchy and inconsistent lately. A lot of functionality is either not working or works poorly.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for the survey. It's nice that you are interested in the opinion of your users. Please reduce the amount of advertising and make it easier to use the main feed (the block under stories). This is the most important thing. At the moment your main feed is just dead - a huge amount of ads (often completely useless and annoying) and with very poor relevance, without the ability to at least filter the feed. Thank you, I hope you will read and listen."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think there is a bug in the app. Everytime I share story on my account from direct photo share or video share, the app keeps opening ""add to story"" page, cannot back to the home page or just simply when I hit the x button or back button, it will keep closing to my home screen. And when I try to open the app again by clicking the icon on home screen, it will be back to ""add to story"" page. I need to kill app first before I can use the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of the worst ever Bugging Apps I've ever seen.... Everything is an bugg not an single thing to mention ... i opened a video sent by my frd you showed the video which were irrelevant that he sent ... i tried a lot to see the video but you keep showing other video ... worst ever .... i lost Data bcozz of you ... chaiiikkkk
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app crashed on me when I was texting my friend and now every time I try opening our texts it automatically crashes but I'm able to open everyone else's, I uninstalled and I left the beta version also been none of that worked, so my only choice was to delete our messages and now I'm able to talk to them but all of our history is gone :( Edit: 12/04/23 Dm's are so broken, I've been loading them for hours and it never shows up"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please for the love of Jesus, fix the ui of leaving comments. It's so annoying to navigate your text left and right with a cursor, which also randomly switches places messing everything you write. Make it a text box. Also bring back the enter key for paragraph indentation. One of the worst feelings on instagram is accidentally pressing ""send"" on the bottom right when you haven't finished writing your comment yet. Just copy paste youtube ui. K tnx bye."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"2 star less because of bugs, glitches and minor issues with new updated features. Edit : It's been 4 years since I'm using Instagram, even though new features are added and bugs are fixed, it still feels like the issues are increasing day by day and also some new features which replaced the old ones are pretty bad and complex, so 1 more star less."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram does not give me the feature of adding audio to a carousel post! I had been waiting for this feature for so long, but when it finally came, so many users like me don't get this feature. I emailed them, and even reported the issue from inside the app. But they do not listen. What nonsense!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I use this app because I enjoy following upcoming artists and small businesses. Seeing their content suppressed makes me contemplate deleting the app. This is really dissapointing. Will certainly be deleting if this doesnt change. I also find the reels rather pushy and irritating. This feature should be deleted or at least have an option that lets users block suggested reels from their feed. There is already an entire menu category for suggested content. Threads are also irritating.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a cool way to share photos and experiences, now it's just dozens of ads and tiktok reposts. Taking away another star, uploading photos is a pain. I constantly have issues with it returning to the photo selection step and losing all of my edits and crops I had just spent 10 mins dialing in."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app One plus point is that the comments option starts lagging whenever the app needs an update. I had experienced it,and this makes me anxious to try again and again for almost 10 times to check what was happened. Later, there was a message which say that search more or something related to this. Although I am not satisfied with this,as I am a anxious person,but the security centre of meta has ensured me that nothing is wrong with my ig account. You know I am confident about your app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app uploads cause my phone to slow down and I've got thousands of broadcast invites that I never wanted had to completely disable my notifications because of all the broadcast channels invites and I'm sick of seeing threads post the amount of times I've clicked see less threads and I still see them every single time I don't want to download threads I have enough bloody social medias

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app but according to me insta should have to upgrade new features like if you have sent someone the picture of something and the person has saved it..insta should upgrade a feature abt this if u delete the pic u sent from chat it also be deleted from their gallery anyone else agree with me or not
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"*issue was resolved, stars went from 2 to 5* It used to be great. I've been an Instagram user since 2012, it's been my favorite platform because of the nice updates and fresh look. since Facebook has taken over, it's gone downhill. quickly. it started with stores messing up constantly, but now its to the point I cant even like, comment, follow, or unfollow people without getting a notification saying ""Action blocked"".

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App lags in personal chats, stories buffer constantly, sometimes you have to uninstall the app the fix annoying bugs. Feels like Meta doesn't really care about optimization"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give this app zero stars I would. Right now it's showing ONLY posts from months ago. The ads and suggested content every other post (or back-to-back) are overkill. Additionally one of my accounts is nothing BUT suggested content, despite having followed multiple accounts. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, and still, nothing to see. Also STOP CROPPING MY PHOTOS!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Poor experience while creating Instagram reels and trying to play the current state of videos and editing the timeline. The preview don't always plays or the video playback lags.. when you play the final result it's ok but the preview screen is so much buggy on Pixel 8 Pro (not sure about other Android devices) and it's a shame. Please improve this experience.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram is becoming so frustrating most of the times. Messages not opening. Profiles not opening. Page going blank. Please fix it. Or update it

The all things inside this app is amazing,and the reels content are very similar to my life incidents.I think this app is best to all other apps and there is no any other apps like this."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"User experience is awful, constant changes, constantly pulling my posts down when follow guidelines, constant glitches on profile pic, bio that not even meta can fix an now cant load on stories. Closing subscriptions down as constantly reports not following guidelines when am. Sick of losing money and opportunities on this platform its become a real hate of late."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This newest app update is so annoying. I enjoyed checking my story archives and previous posts each day. Now that's nearly impossible because I don't have the ability to see each individual month. It makes getting to the right point so unnecessarily difficult. I don't understand changing something and making it worse.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Let's try the update!?? Things change better or worse??Texting with a celeb I found many profiles using her info at will. I stoped text. I was irrate. Bad spelling/slang told it was more than 1 person. Another celeb sent text & the same thing started again! It'd stop if location was known, then report & block! Profile Location problem solved! Plus Disallowing my HONEST replies to Great reels also? Protecting those mystery profiles/scammers! Some things we're better off without,to keep it honest!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear Instagram, it's a great app but there are certain things which needs to be fixed asap.. Replacing an audio seems to be impossible even after if there is an option which allows it to do so, it doesn't work.. Another thing is that please allow users to add pics and videos in one frame while uploading stories.."

However I had an old account for a long time, about 2-3 years ago I got logged out of my account, and did all the steps to verify my account but they said that they couldn't give me access to it..... Okay, so I made a new one, and now it logged me out and won't let me back in, again!! I've sent an email to support three times and have heard NOTHING back. I LOVE Instagram besides it doing this!! Great app and great reels and suggestions."

For last few weeks, the audio from this app continues playing after I close the app it's such an inconvenience for me to manually clear it from my recent apps. Crashed whenever I add gifs to stories, writing long captions & multiple tags on a single post.

I have not been given the option to use it while all of my friends have. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, turned my activity on and off, changed my account type back and forth, nothing works. Once I have notes I'll give a 5 star!"

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Personally I think this app used to be good but constantly posts don't play or don't load. It crashes constantly and says I have notifications when I don't. I've tried checking my wifi and there's nothing wrong with it everything else in my home works fine and runs smoothly. So I was wondering when are u guys going to fix these problems and optimize Instagram? 2024 these same problems still happen. Every time I join a live the audio is slowed down immensely
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app used to be very good but for some reason my other account doesn't get any of the updates while my main does. I have also encountered a major problem which is that the top comments of any reels/posts are not showing and the sorting feature just disappeared. This problem is only on my main and It works normally how it used to on my alt. Please kindly take regard in this matter because it is very annoying not to see the top comments of any posts/reels.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app since many years N I'm glad to say that it's amazing but day by day it is creating problems in every feature.... Some kind of time limit is been setup on reel which I cannot even extend nor could turn it off.... N the second one is worst I cannot even take the screenshot of the chats as it says that it's restricted due to community guidelines why I can't even share the screenshot of message I receive.... I think Instagram should work on it asap!!!!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really getting frustrated with this app. The ads are now out of control. When I'm on my main feed, I want to quickly see the people I follow, not endless ads and suggested posts. When I browse search, by all means, show me suggestions. What you're doing, is lowering my engagement on the core part of the app, so I spend less and less time on it. The time wasted on ads is no longer worth the effort of keeping up with the people/personalities I had chosen to follow."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no way to navigate to a post you've previously seen. If you're on a zombie-scroll for a span and find a post you want to revisit. It's nearly impossible to find again if your app crashes or you navigate out of the app and the feed reloads.

So may you give more control than any other member in group."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All the new updates don't update at the same time across all my profiles, sometimes it's like using two different apps with how much differently they update. I also wish instagram had a feature to be staying at the same place in chat while replying to an old message, instead of coming all the way down to the new message I just sent. I have to scroll up back to infinity."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram has been acting up for the entirety of 2023, lots of bugs and glitches consistently. Some bugs fixed, but some just won't. For example, whenever I go to my followers list, I can't see everyone I'm following. I can only see 25 of the latest accounts I'm following. It has been like that since October and won't fix it. I've tried deleting the app, clearing my cache, and exiting out of my account."

I wish the Ads paid campaign targeted my entire account content, and not just the selected post.

For safety reasons, I would like the Instagram App to be equip with a FALL DETECTION SENSORS and linked to the emergency land line(Not just the shake phone to report)"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tots love the app my experience has been great watching it evolve . It is an absolute favorite of mine but don't get too addicted yes it's addictive but you can set a timer for how long you want to be on insta and when time is up it will pop up on screen no adverts and there's also parental options has really great features

Suggested content is severely off the mark, or viral-only crud. - Reels and photo drafts do not work, wasted time and effort - Notifications/dms are buggy - Follower count keeps jumping around despite no change in followers or notications for new ones. Count will bounce back up a few after couple days."

Pretty bad when an app made for posting photos makes it so if you dm someone photos theyre terribly degraded in quality. Doesn't have the same issue with posting photos, and it's not internet related to my knowledge, so I don't get why this is a problem me and many I know have. No longer able to get rid of suggested feed, and that along with sponsored content makes it intolerable to try and see posts of people you follow."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall pretty good app, but still lacking a few features the iOS version has. Works fine on Galaxy S22. One thing I would like incorporated, is the filtering function when searching tags to be a bit more diverse - currently one able to filter ""Top Posts"" and ""Recent Top Posts"", would like to be able to see most recent, regardless of like, so I can find smaller creators and more unique pages"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used Instagram for a long time but stopped for a while, and I've recently decided to start using it again. Something I enjoyed doing was going to hashtags and finding small fan accounts of things I enjoy. But all that appears are ""top posts"" and ""recent top post"" literally the same post are on both and it's annoying. I want actual recent post back. Please bring it back. Explore doesn't always show recent post, it only does ""top posts/recent top post""."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great no doubt, but the issue of glitching(automatically reducing number of followers, not being able to see messages sent, etc) is very pathetic and it gets worse daily. And having a personal and business account on the app, anytime you switch from business to personal then back to business, Instagram automatically logs you out from your business account and it's really sad."

I tried to log in on multiple devices and it's literally the same situation on all them! Then I tried to log in through the Internet browser and I'm still having the same problem!

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Feed recommendations are just not working properly. Too many russian posts in my feed. And it's most some propaganda or advertisements. The thing is, I don't speak russian, I wasn't looking for any russian content on Instagram. I'm clicking ""not interested"" every time, when I see something in russian. But it doesn't help. Is Instagram paid for showing content like that?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works perfect for social interaction and keeping contact with friends/family but every so often it bugs and tells me it ""couldn't refresh feed"" which leaves me on a completely blank screen and unable to do anything at all"

What in the actual heck? I just made them like two seconds ago, how is that even possible?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very useless application, total waste of time, instead of using this we can do something productive, everyday I am seeing new bug or glitch,with using high speed wifi I can't see reels without any interruption."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The amount of bugs on this app is overwhelming. Have to restart the app several times before posting a video with so many crashes. Algorithm is sucking artists dry. What is happening?
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New Users will have a hard time finding reach on this app. Changes to the Search feature make it so the most popular posts are focused on, diminishing posts from smaller creators who may have up-to-date content. The push towards Reels (video) is a shameless attempt at chasing what TikTok has, and makes the app noisy and obnoxious. Every 30 days it pushes ""suggested"" content into a feed already bogged down by ads, and the suggested are always Reels. Pathetic that it can't be turned off entirely."

Unfortunately, there is a lot more gore content flooding the app. I don't want/need to see this content and don't intentionally try to seek out this content. I really don't know how this started, whether I liked the wrong post or if I followed the wrong account. If I was looking for gore content, I'd download X instead."

I want to see EVERY post from EVERY account I follow. 4. Bring back the ability to sort searches by the newest/oldest ALL, not ""top searches."" 5. If you're going to promote Reels over photos, make a separate app for those and let Instagram be for photos again."

Also,the site Forces u to use the phone app but its always janky, struggling to open and fails to load most options. If I could leave, I would. Im only grateful for the friends and family it keeps me connected to."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good bt my friend CHANCHAL AGRAWAL came up with a situation on Instagram. She says there must be an option to post full length photos too. As she is having problem in using another app to square the image and then post on Instagram. Please bring the same feature in next update.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram has started to glitch a lot since the last few days. I can't open my DMs very easily. It buffers everytime I open my DMs. When I'm watching reels or a post all of a sudden it shuts down and I have to open it again.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why can't I post reels from my drafts? It keeps saying that there's some kind of issue, without clarifying what it is. This app seem to be having a new issue every other day, it's frustrating"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some things on Instagram are okay. Most things on Instagram are absolute toxic piles of garbage! Take the reels for instance... If you scroll through enough of them, you will find a plethora of women promoting some type of pornography. And somehow those posts are okay, but things that depict even a small amount of violence, or other kind of content that isn't nudity, are usually taken down. Instagram approves of pedophilia and scams btw."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is okay. One things that I would appreciate getting improved are the chats. I wish they worked like the ones on tik tok were you can start from the first reel that someone sent you and scroll down to the next sent video instead of having to go out of the current reel and find the next reel. 3 or more people send me reels and it's tedious to have to go back track and comment like I would like to because once I respond to a reel and sends me to the bottom of the chat. Thank you in advance

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please change the mechanism of sharing reels on story. It seems like first the reel is downloaded from your server into my device then re-uploaded to put it on the story and it takes a lot of time. Make the process in such a way that it just gets transferred within your servers, so that it saves time and sim user's data pack."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Rubbish app. Uploading reel keeps getting stuck at 90% then hangs up your entire mobile data bandwidth even with a speed of over 40Mbps.

What is this, where is user privacy?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 of every 4 posts is an invasive advert. 25% of this whole application is selling you stuff you don't need. Absolute greed.

Also every 3 4 months they just simply block the account temporarily and then you cannot follow. Like. Comment or do any other particular things.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Now that the search function has been changed it's virtually impossible to use the app. I can't search for the more recent things for the pictures I'm interested based on my hobby. It makes the app virtually impossible to use and is super annoying. GIVE ME BACK THE OLD SEARCH FUNCTION.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reel editing experience is consistently incredibly buggy. Does anyone even test their code? Why can't I have even do the simplest task ie. have some text-to-speech text on the reel that actually works in the preview.

I can't see recent posts in hashtags anymore, only the top recent ones, and it's frustrating. They don't show your posts that contain blocked hadhtags and you even won't know that it happens."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Basic things like clicking on your likes on a comment are too complex for the app. It'll force you to look at likes for a post instead. Someone over there in a manager position isn't doing a lot of managing it would seem. Maybe by now the app would have a direction to go rather than just being a glorified Snapchat filter for longer stories.

Also so many ads and repeated videos, takes about 5 minutes to scroll down to the 'caught up' part and most of the kids I've seen previously.

ALSO THEY NEED TO ADD A THING IN YOUR FOLLOWING TO SEE WHO DOESNT FOLLW BACK."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,i love this app and its very useful for me to be able to post videos and talk to friends however when in a group chat the buttons to start a group voice/video call and in the top right corner. this is very inconvenient as it gets pressed many times accidentally. it is very embarrasing and all my friends laugh at me when i press it. i am not alone in this dislike as almost all my friends have accidentally pressed and subsequently embarrassed themselves due to the placement.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Something needs to be done about notifications you've set alerts for from pages you follow. I get a notification but as soon as I open the app to see one, the others disappear. It would make more sense for the alerts to show in the notifications in the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why can't we watch videos horizontally and be able to pause them? And in ""direct"", why we can't delete more than one post, message or voice at the same time? These are really necessary things and not having these options is annoying. Please immediately add these things to the app."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When a app of such scale fails to provide its declared features, it's infuriating. I can't add music to carousel or explore new effects. You can access such features as can be seen from other peoples post but for some reason I can't do it. It's a common complain by many amd I really hope it gets fixed."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Instagram dark mode went from pitch black/ lights out to light navy blue. Its driving me crazy at nights and dark areas. What even is the use of such a useless feature which you cant even turn off and its happening on my main account, not on the other accounts. I'm willing to stop using Instagram solely due to this."

Fourth, layering option not available."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Way too many fake accounts being created with inappropriate pics available to under 18 boys and girls being able to see the photos and click on links sent in direct messages. Facebook and/or Instagram will not do anything about this and doubt they will not even see this message either. Also, updates do not give any info on what bugs have been fixed. So many bugs that go unfixed while added bloated features are constantly being added to the app. It's broken! Fix it Zuckerberg!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was way better before Now it shows reels thar I already chose not interested.

Terrible editing feature included inside the app."

Once I click and view a story or reel it is the only one that continues to load even when selecting thumbnails for other stories and reels. Closing and reopening app only restarts the cycle.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has so many inexcusable bugs! Garbage! Won't load camera roll anymore. The chat is almost unusable, plus the post editor randomly reverts your photo edits and changes aspect ratios etc. I don't know what happened, these ridiculous problems never used to be there. How embarrassing for such a large developer."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Instagram keeps getting worse after every new update. Isn't the whole point of an 'update' is to make the app more smooth in running for the users? It's quite the opposite here. I will gladly come back and fill up the remaining 2 stars once your team sorts out all the annoying bugs.

I was like what happened, then i said maybe an issue from my side, i thought let's do whatever it asks. I changed the password as per the instructions. Later, i'm not being allowed to like, comment on any post. Like for real? Is this what you call an experience? I tried re-installing the app. Now again i'm being asked to change password.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is a world and have everything, its almost perfect but if there were a option to hide the like, comments share or other things from the reels while watching with just one tap it would be more engaging and make people stay longer on the app. Also it will be just like a movie to us. For the watchers..!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly new bugs that never cease. Also extremely biased about what content they will take down and what they won't, even though my content doesn't violate guidelines and I appeal, they still keep it down. It has a lot of potential. However, with all the downsides, I'd have to say that overall it is extremely disappointing."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like everything on the app except for one thing and that is to why android users don't usually get the same features as those who are ios users like the music on the noted feature which I find really cool but got disappointed when I didn't have it due to my phone. I just hoped that it will be fixed some day.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What's going on with this app? It doesn't let me choose photos from SD card and it doesn't save uploaded photos to device.

Unhappy with instagram, it never takes your complaints, and there are so many people who are opening fake accounts of your instagram id, but instagram does not take any action. ü´§"

I really don't like the gif/sticker relpies on posts in the comment section, but I love to scroll and read/reply in the comments. They also slow my phone down a lot, which is annoying. I then found the setting that turns off gif comments on posts, but the issue is that it only works on your own posts/comments; I don't want to see gif/sticker replies on any comments on any posts. 5* If this is fixed!"

Please solve this problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Frankly, it's just not that great. For an app of this age, it's clunky and not intuitive. It's popular because it's popular. If this were a brand new app that didn't have name recognition, and billions of dollars behind it, it wouldn't find success. I wish people would stop supporting apps with such poor design. Especially when they show no interest in improving the bad design."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not been able to add captions with reels or comment on my posts or anyone else's for that matter for the past 2 days. I've reported the issue over and over again and still not had any resolve. Never had this happen before so disappointed its happening and can't get hold of a real human to help fix the issue.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is full of glitches. The feed doesn't refress most of the times. Once you pin a post there is no option to unpin. Messages in DMs get send twice. Random people whose profiles I have never even seen are present in my follow list. Please improve the application.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Add Yours sticker is fixed. Now, loading photos from the phone's storage isn't.

"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Update to add - I'd really like a way to repost stories I'm not tagged in i.e. from a popular creator I follow. One change I'd like to see would be to have one page on profiles for just photos. So many times I click on a post on someone's main page and it's a reel instead of a photo - just a minor annoyance.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please fix the issue of where the app keeps automatically resetting the feed. It's extremely annoying while you're on the phone with somebody or reading, etc, and it changes the feed, so you basically miss out on a lot of posts/reels."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Get rid of the forced next reel watching. I'm trying to rewatch a reel and I'm forced to move onto the next one after my first rewatch because instagram is trying to brainwash people into being addicted to their app and ruin their attention spans. Let me watch a reel as many times as I want without forcing me to move onto the next reel. It's not asking for much besides basic human decency to not do everything in your power to brainwash myself and others to be addicted to your app for ad revenue.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to work okay, but since last update I cannot access pictures from my SD card, meaning I cannot upload any pictures with an app that only has video and pictures. Reading other reviews it seems that other Android users also have this problem, how was this not tested and how has this been going on for weeks? This ain't an amateur app or a solo developer app. Ridiculous."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Has way too many bugs. It freezes after going back once. The dark mode takes it too literally and makes even the letters black so the whole screen is black except the pic or reel. You can't even upload a story in peace without it bugging.

The messages keep loading. Insta is getting worse over time!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Okay, let's talk about ads. I'm not the type to care about ads here and there, but this is ridiculous. Two ads for every two stories you watch, seriously??? Much less actually scrolling posts! Half my feed is ads I don't care about, and at this point I'm blocking every account and reporting every ad as spam so you have to do more work and experience this frustration yourselves. You're a multi-billion $ company, there is no reason for this excessivness."

"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For no apparent reason this app eats up 8GB of storage on my phone every time I make a reel. I have to wipe the app storage and reset my app settings every time to make sure I don't run out of storage on my phone after making a few reels!
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Beware security bug - app sharing videos in DMs without my consent - Meta won't help. For the last few months the app has randomly been sharing videos from my device to differ over recently spoken to in DMs. I've tried reporting them and nothing. I paid to be verified so I'd be able to contact support (hoping meta would care about this security concern!) and was told it would be escalated but a month later it's still happening, and they are just fobbing me off.

I can't even find the option to remove it. There's the option to ""hide"" but once the feed is refreshed, they show up again. Very annoying and inconvenient."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Done with Instagram. My advice, do not create an artist account under your artist name and do not add a 2 factor identification security system because they will lock you out and never give you back your account. By the way, I've attempted to contact the app support many times and zero response. Been almost 1 year. Amazing customer service for a billion dollar app. (Of course that's sarcasm)"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please stop changing how you send, download, or share videos. It's getting annoying. It's nearly weekly that they change how you send reels to people and how you download them. It was fine before, this update is just full of clutter"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One of the biggest problems with this app is that I cannot click the pause on videos. It is just turning the audio off. I don't like this thing. No recommendation, show you only the people you subscribed to. 50/50 problem."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a really good social media platform, but I don't know why, for somedays its been telling me that my password has been compromised again and again, and I have been changing passwords again and again, and Iam fed up of this and due to this problem and your guidelines, this could make me lose my account, and I don't wanna lose my account, so fix this problem ASAP. Secondly the music option is not showing on the carousels. My account is private."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Namasthe ! The only App that sucks on a lot of data and seriously guys, uploading a video ( 30 seconds one ) takes a life time. What's wrong with your servers ? Everytime I gotta upload a video, I gotta stop all other online activities. My connection is superb. But only on Insta, this kinda really slow or poor connection happens. Hope you guys have the time to check on the review as much as you ask us to rate it and then respond , do something practically about it. ! Above all now threads !"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fix your damn buggy edit feature for androids. Just adding simple, multiple texts? Nope, gone. You can't edit it anymore. Actually, how about refusing to appear in the first place! Lag? Hooo-hah! What the hell is clean fps. End result after uploading? Immediately defenestrated all your hard work away because what even is that. Creating reels? What's that? New happy meal? Nada. Nope. Zero. Null. Fix. Please. I just want to add text onto my videos, why is it so uselessly hard?"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly changing stuff around so things are constantly broken such as DMs. Messages hardly ever come through and I have to refresh multiple times for ""Suggested messages"" to go away"" as well as never having the opportunity to know where anything is cuz its there one minute gone the next. With the added ""benefit"" of your feed is bombarded with ""suggested posts"" you cant remove. I'd genuinely give zero stars with how broken this app is"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Idk really were to start.... lots and lots of bugs coming once you finish your updates .. once insta was my fav app to chat but now it's nah it's not Instagram it's so called instabug ... Much disappointed improper reels, highlights start to disappear,begans to stuck in one reel... Hope it gets better"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Instagram is a game-changer in social media. Its user-friendly interface, vibrant community, and creative tools make it stand out. The Explore page introduces new content, and constant updates keep things fresh. Privacy controls ensure a secure environment. Instagram's impact on industries and commitment to innovation make it more than just an app‚Äîit's a cultural phenomenon. Kudos to the team for creating a platform that captures the essence of our digital age!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In the FOLLOWING & FOLLOWERS tab, if you scroll down, it ALWAYS repeats those at the very top for all categories (Earliest, Latest, etc). It only shows around the first 20 or so. You need to unfollow people and refresh for 1-5 persons to show up next. My IG is using the LATEST version. Please fix it."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My account got breached not too long ago, and now Instagram does very little to help me get this back. It is absolutely unacceptable. There should be more options for situations like this, not just a horribly done selfie portrait. I don't have any photos of myself, but this is just bad practice on their part. We need more ways to get back our accounts. 1 star."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,PRO: The user interface aka ui is good. Didn't learn it as easily as learned as unreal engine user interface in 2004 but enough for a person my age can pick up. CONS: Dont really care for people uploading my contact information to the web. Not like the world is really safe right now and its kinda invading my privacy in a way. I cannot consent to legal terminology in the use of service because they used the app before me. Now my info is stolen. So thanks meta. I practice law too.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really disappointed.I just wanted to upload 30 pictures and it is max 10, unless I make a reel, a disgusting thing that makes a movie with the pictures, which mean it is not possible to watch them a normally anymore. Berk!!!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trying to look at something? Nope, app is going to refresh and bury it forever. Using the app for more than 5 minutes? Going to stop loading data forcing an app restart to work again. Did you accidentally click on something made with A.I.? Algorithm is going to shove so much A.I. garbage at you that you'll start to question reality."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i cannot like, see the comment section and all (basically using the button on the reels) for quite some times and it's frustrating. double tap doesnt work too sometimes, it's like view only and cannot do interaction on the reel video."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Following some kind of update, once again, unable to load multiple pictures (in wide view), they all get distorted to the wrong ratio (vertical). Everything else seems to be unaffected; i.e. single picture upload, reel, etc."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"-The messages app shows unsent messages on the chat when unsending a message, going back and immediately going back to the message thread. -It keeps reshowing one story on IG as unseen when I've already seen it. I have all stories as seen and I refresh and it showed that same one as unread on every refresh."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app. It limits my profile reach for no reason, its algorythm $u¬©k$ a$$, don't show pictures on my phone when I wanna upload one but they're certainly there, every 3rd post is ad, reels are lagging all the time and have to scroll down and back to stop it, when i get a notification and want to read it, it runs to an error, my recomendations has nothing to do with what I'm watching, good for nothing customer service which never answers to a report."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update from 1/30 seems to have fixed the SD access issue from the previous update. Good improvement. The rest of the updated features are ok, but it's clearly more geared towards ""content creating"" rather than just sharing photos."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It always have various issues like lagging, can't see post with songs, some stories not loading since no network issue is there, etc. The app is making me so angry because of its constant issues. Also I want to leave the beta version but still after leaving from the beta community the beta version of Instagram is being installed in my phone."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App has been buggy the last few days where it is not showing me the normal content I see on my search page. When I try to fix my feed by saying I am not interested in this topic they show me even more of that same topic. Will be uninstalling this app unless this bug is fixed you suggested content doesn't work at all
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"HEY I LOVE THE APP BUTTT PLEASE JUST ONE REQUEST- okay so when we search for something in the dms with someone it takes us to that text but we can only scroll limitedly like we can see only see the particular text we searched for and a few msgs up and down and it shows ""results view, go down to new messages"" i just want to read all the old texts by searching one of them pleeeease add that feature"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constant troubles, I can't log in, you can't search messages in chat, can't reply to certain things shared such as post and stories, only to reels; my Instagram just froze one day and it stopped loading. Edit: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, now I only have a black feed with nothing in it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Instagram use to be great but has gotten too money hungry with ads and sponsored spam content. I barely see my friends and get spammed with reels I can't turn off. About every 3 friend post is another ad. Ontop of that, the algorithm and reach has gotten worse as well. Unless you pay, friends no longer see your content, and even if you do pay, they'll outsourcing it other states and counties when you try to keep it local or only people who already see your stuff normally. Waiting on a better sm."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Amazing in all ways but I just want to suggest an idea for the next update. I would love if the highlight pictures on your profile page could be from your gallery/photos on your device as well and not just from your stories as a person who doesn't use stories that much:)
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to get back into my Instagram accounts for months! I have 2 accounts that I got locked out of when my old phone got crushed. Again, I have been trying for MONTHS to get back into these accounts, but at this point, I'm done. It would be great if customer service could help me delete these 2 inactive accounts so my personal photos aren't just out on the internet with no way for me to access them. But at this point, I wouldn't make another account on this app if they paid me üñï"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It was the best Application which I used. It was really good to share my memories and photos with other but I can't add music to my stories. if you give this ability to Android phones as well it would be good.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its better if this application gets renamed as Adsgram instead of Instagram. You have one or the other ads for after every post and story. Iam tiered of reporting the ads and it shows all irrelevant ads. Sometimes what i can see is only ads inbetween i see 1 or 2 post and stories. Do developers kindly work on updating its name to Adsgram
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well, i was logged out in the ealry January, tried to log in again without success since. Have reset password, the process is smooth until i try to log in again. Tried the facial recognition without success. I still have control through the Meta account manager but i can not log in. All communications from Instagram on trying to log in are received but the codes for verifications to log in. How do we fix this instagram? Worst experience for me this year."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Was working fine but now my photos won't load from the SD card. Also can't upload more than 1 photo at a time from my phone's gallery. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Cleared the cache. Verified permissions. None of that was successful.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,While scrolling through reels: It's not okay to automatically proceed to the next video after 6 seconds especially while reading comments on one specific reel I find interesting/ entertaining. What's worse is that it'll automatically lead you to an advertisement I don't care about. It's horrible
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I always face issues while uploading stories or any posts or reels. It always gets stuck, and the photos don't load. I'm really frustrated. The app's speed needs to improve, and a lot of bugs need to be removed. Instagram uploadi g is never smooth."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have been experiencing so many issues recently. I can't send posts , reels and even messages to anyone,it just keeps saying failed to send. While watching reels the music keeps on disconnecting. These are not minor issues so I hope these get fixed immediately."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app consistently doesn't download pictures. I regularly shut down/restart phone every day, I've cleared my cache. I even have an updated Android and I've tried it on WiFi and my home network. Yet I cannot scroll thru IG multiple times per day as photos never load. Do better, Instagram developers."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I open the app, it's either the stories, posts, or everything that decides not to load up. Now even my notifications are showing up weird or days after. Even posting on my story is a challenge because it will say ""error"" and won't post even after multiple attempts."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately lots of bugs, pictures wont send to people unless you leave the app and enter again, share on facebook button on stories wont work, peoples stories that are already seen appear unseen again, following feed keeps repeating itself ... lots of others but these few are really annoying."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lots of bug, specially when you post multiple pictures and video on feed comes an error will auto post when possible! I check internet connectivity, clear Instagram cash, sign out and in again, force stop and so on. Neither of them help and I only can post a picture or a video, but not together!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Instagram crashes at random times when I'm using the app that it straight up becomes unusable. Whenever I like too many posts at a time it thinks I'm a spam bots and locks my account unless I log out and log back in again. This makes it impossible to use the app for long periods of time that I might as well use only desktop.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The highlights does not appear after a few days and just the loading button appears and even the stories are not visible in archive the main point of highlights is to highlight the stories for a long time what is the use of that feature if its not even doing it properly üòíüòíüòíüòíüòí repair it fast
"April 15, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes when editing reels, it becomes needlessly difficult. You add text, go to change it and its disappeared in the editing screen but it still shows up. Its almost like not everything loads when editing. Other than that, it's great!"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't like that you can't click on the picture to see it bigger. I hate that it's migrating to prioritizing videos over other content. Stop trying to be Snapchat and TikTok. The algorithm situation makes it so hard to enjoy the app but it's something I need to promote my business. I also hate seeing ads every 3 posts.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is getting worse by day. I can't even open comments anymore, nor even do some simple tasks like commenting, liking, and even talking to others. Everything is lagging or just doesn't work, as well as reels not functioning properly. This app is dead. Try something new."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's really good! But I have slight trouble with creating videos with transitions or if I'm trying to sing to a song and do transitions it always seems like my mouth isn't actually mouthing the words.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bring back the following feed, or at least show me everything from everyone I follow in chronological order on the home page. I don't even care if there are ads. Lost this function by upgrading to a new phone. Uninstalled because it's useless to me without this feature."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Worst ever. Can't upload a reel it continue showing the pop up, like Can't upload this time. Try again later. I have tried everything. Clear cache, clear data, uninstall/install app everything. But no result and no supports from admin team even. It's really worst ever."
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,the app is very buggy and they removed so many features from my account that others somehow still have like the option to add pronouns and the ability to add songs in posts with multiple images. im just hoping that eventually they add it back but im very disappointed about having to even wait to get these features back.
"April 15, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As an avid social media user, I have tried numerous platforms to share my daily experiences and connect with friends and family. Amongst all these platforms, Instagram stands out to me as a true game-changer. This highly popular and engaging app has completely revolutionized the way we share and interact with visual content. With its user-friendly interface and constant updates, Instagram has become a go-to platform for millions of users worldwide. One of the standout features of Instagram is it"
"April 15, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have an issue when upload photos take from a camera, the colours change drastically. For example blue becomes purple and it ads contrast to the photo and skin tones become desaturated. I tried reinstalling the app but no change."
